{"id":46954,"title":"Prognostic criteria in colorectal carcinoma constructed by the combination of tumor-related and host-related factors.","abstract":"The significance of prognostic criteria based on a combination of tumor-related and host-related factors for patients with colorectal carcinoma has not been appreciated fully.Correlation of tumor-related and host-related score (TRHRS), which are constructed by the combination of serum elevation of C-reactive protein and pathologic lymph node metastasis (scores ranging 0 to 2), with clinicopathologic features including prognosis was studied in 271 patients with colorectal carcinoma who had been treated with curative resection.Significant difference regarding survival was observed both between TRHRS 0 and 1 (P = .028) and between TRHRS 1 and 2 (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that histologic types (P = .040) and TRHRS (P < .0001) were independent prognostic indicators.Criteria for the prediction of prognosis in colorectal carcinoma treated with curative resection based on both tumor-related and host-related factors could provide a strict stratification.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612685","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.794734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.740782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"}]}
