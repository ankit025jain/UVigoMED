{"id":91186,"title":"Traumatic high-grade cervical dislocation: treatment strategies and outcomes.","abstract":"Traumatic high-grade cervical spinal dislocations are rare injuries, generally associated with severe neurological compromise. In particular, cervical spondyloptosis (>100% subluxation) is rarely reported. The object of our study is to present a case series describing presentation, management, and outcome in traumatic high-grade cervical spinal dislocations.Retrospective analysis was performed involving two level 1 trauma centers. Patients with a high-grade traumatic cervical subluxation were selected from a database, and these patients were admitted between August 2007 and July 2011.Fifteen patients were identified; three had spondyloptosis. The admission American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade varied (A = 9; B = 2; C = 1; D = 2; E = 1). Fourteen patients underwent attempted closed reduction with six (43%) failing closed reduction. High-dose methylprednisolone was administered in nine patients (60%). All patients underwent surgical stabilization: three underwent anterior only, three underwent posterior only, and nine underwent a combined anterior-posterior approach. Postoperatively, one patient improved two AIS grades, three improved one AIS grade, nine maintained their preoperative score, and two patients worsened.In this series, 26.7% of patients had improvement in their AIS grade postoperatively, and the majority of patients (60%) maintained their preoperative AIS grade. In 57% of patients placed in traction, reduction was possible. Likely due to the severity of these injuries, there was a high incidence of complications. However, review of patient outcomes reveals that these patients can have improvement of neurological function. We recommend aggressive reduction and surgical stabilization. Our preference is either a combined anterior-posterior approach or a posterior-only approach.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530458","annotations":[{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.78417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.692953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.60711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.28845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.253016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0763854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Stabilization (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilization_(medicine)"},{"name":"Likely, British Columbia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likely,_British_Columbia"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.0158952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
