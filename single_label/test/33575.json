{"id":33575,"title":"[Effect of Ningdong Granule on the levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha in children patients with Tourette's syndrome].","abstract":"To observe the effect of Ningdong Granule (NG) on serum levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) of children patients with Tourette's syndrome (TS).Totally 90 TS children patients were randomly assigned to the NG group, the NG + Tiapride group (abbreviated as the combined treatment group), and the Tiapride group, 30 in each group. Besides,another 30 healthy children were recruited as the healthy control group. Patients in the NG group were treated with NG (consisting of all gastrodia rhizome, Codonopsis pilosula, Ophiopogon japonicus, white peony root, Rhinocerotidae, oyster, earthworm, licorice root, etc.), one dose daily, administered by dissolving it in boiled water, taken in two portions in the morning and in the evening respectively. Patients in the Tiapride group took Tiapride Tablet, 50 -100 mg each time, twice daily. The dosage was adjusted according to individual difference and changes of pathogenic conditions. The maximal dosage was 300 mg per day. Those in the combined treatment group were treated with equal dose of NG and Tiapride Tablet in combination. The treatment course was 3 months for all. Changes of pathogenic condition before and after treatment were assessed by Yale global tic severity scale (YGTSS). Serum levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were detected by enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before and after treatment.(1) The total effective rate of the NG group, the combined treatment group, and the Tiapride group was 79.3%, 83.3%, and 67.9%, respectively. It was the lowest in the Tiapride group (P < 0.05). It was significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in the NG group (P < 0.05). (2) The post-treatment YGTSS score was obviously lower in each group after treatment than before treatment (P < 0.05). The posttreatment YGTSS score was obviously lower in the NG group and the combined treatment group than in the Tiapride group (P < 0.05), but with no statistical difference between the fromer two groups (P > 0.05).(3) Compared with the healthy control group before treatment, serum levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha (pg/mL) were 124.95 +/- 22.78 and 209.52 +/- 21.69 in the NG group, 126.14 +/- 25.65 and 208.97 +/- 22.46 in the combined treatment group, 123.00 +/- 24.26 and 205.10 +/- 26.16 in the Tiapride group, being higher than those in the healthy control group (64.56 +/- 27.59 and 78.13 +/- 33.42; P < 0.05). After treatment, serum levels of of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were 104.67 +/- 16.84 and 183.01 +/- 24.95 in the NG group, 109.04 +/- 16.81 and 179.87 +/- 23.45 in the combined treatment group, significantly lower than before treatment (P < 0.05). But there was no statistical difference in serum levels of IL-12 or TNF-alpha in the Tiapride group between before treatment (123.00 +/- 24.26 and 205.10 +/- 26.16) and after treatment (117.75 +/- 16.79 and 199.76 +/- 33.21; P > 0.05).NG could modulate abnormal serum levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha in TS children patients, which might be one of its pharmacodynamic mechanisms for treating TS.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
