{"id":85294,"title":"Physiological effects of rapid reduction in carbon dioxide partial pressure in submarine tower escape.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine whether adverse effects from a rapid drop in inspired carbon dioxide partial pressure (PiCO?) in the breathing gas could hinder or prevent submarine tower escape.A total of 34 male volunteers, mean (SD) age 33.8 (7.5) years, completed the trial. They breathed air for five minutes then 5% CO?/16% O?, 79% N? (5CO?/16O?) for 60 minutes before switching to breathing 100% O? for 15 minutes and then returned to air breathing. Breathing gases were supplied from cylinders via scuba regulators and mouthpieces. Blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity, electrocardiogram and end-tidal CO? and end-tidal O? were monitored throughout. Subjects were asked at intervals to indicate symptom type and severity.Symptoms whilst breathing 5CO?/16O? included breathlessness and headache. Following the switch to 100% O? seven subjects reported mild to moderate faintness, which was associated with a significant drop in cerebral blood flow compared to those who did not feel faint (P < 0.02). No subject vomited or fainted following this breathing-gas switch.This study shows that the risk of fainting, sudden collapse or vomiting on switching to 100% O? following acute exposures to hypercapnia at a PiCO? of up to 5.0 kPa is less than 8%.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986726","annotations":[{"name":"Hypercapnia","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercapnia"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Breathing gas","weight":0.844232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.714499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Submarine","weight":0.58524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.479809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cerebral blood flow","weight":0.448729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_blood_flow"},{"name":"Scuba diving","weight":0.419198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving"},{"name":"Diving regulator","weight":0.387149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_regulator"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.326451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"Neutron moderator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator"},{"name":"Cylinder (engine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
