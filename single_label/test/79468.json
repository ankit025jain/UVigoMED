{"id":79468,"title":"[Diagnosis and treatment of verrucous laryngeal cancer--a case report].","abstract":"A male patient of 71 years old was admitted due to repeated hoarseness for two years which got worse accompanied with dyspnea so that to receive tracheotomy in another hospital more than one month ago. The two vocal cord biopsies carried out in the other hospital before showed vocal keratosis and squamous cell hyperplasia. Electronic laryngoscopy result showed normal epiglottis. a lot of saliva at hypopharynx, and rough arytenoid mucosa. The supraglottic area was remarkably swollen and the glottal area can not be observed clearly. The biopsy of throat was unable to conduct. Barium swallow examination revealed no obvious space-occupying lesion in piri form fossa or esophagus. Larynx CT scan showed a space-occupying lesion in the laryngeal cavity on the right side of the neck involving the thyroid cartilage. The patient was finally treated by total laryngectomy. cervical infected tissue resection. grafting transposition with pectoralis major flap and tracheostomy. The postoperative pathology showed laryngeal verrucous carcinoma.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
