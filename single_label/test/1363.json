{"id":1363,"title":"[Endovascular exclusion of peripheral aneurysms with polytetrafluoroethene stent graft].","abstract":"To evaluate the value and clinical effect of peripheral aneurysms with polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) stent graft after peripheral endovascular procedures.From May 2012 to November 2013, 13 patients of peripheral aneurysms were treated with PTFE stent graft. There were 9 male and 4 female patients, aged from 24 to 74 years with a mean of 52 years. There were 7 aneurysms and 6 pseudoaneurysms. This stent graft was a self-expanding nitinol stent, internally covered by an ultra-thin polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) graft. All peripheral aneurysms were repaired with the PTFE stent graft, using an entirely percutaneous approach. All patients were given clopidogrel and (or) aspirin postoperatively. Complications and reintervention rates were also examined.PTFE stent graft placement was successfully performed in all the 13 cases, and the instant isolation effect was quite satisfactory. During the follow-up period of 3 to 18 months, no stent graft related complications occurred in all patients except one patient with iliac arterial pseudoaneurysm, who developed pseudoaneurysms presented as a complication at puncture site. There were no other symptomatic complications with graft patience.Endovascular repair can be considered as an effective treatment strategy for peripheral aneurysms by PTFE stent graft.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370760","annotations":[{"name":"Stent","weight":0.887503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.573515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.432167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Nickel titanium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_titanium"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Patience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
