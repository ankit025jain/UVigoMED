{"id":35394,"title":"GNE myopathy: a prospective natural history study of disease progression.","abstract":"Mutations in the glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene cause GNE myopathy, a mildly progressive autosomal recessive myopathy. We performed a prospective natural history study in 24 patients with GNE myopathy to select evaluation tools for use in upcoming clinical trials. Patient clinical conditions were evaluated at study entry and one-year follow-up. Of the 24 patients, eight (33.3%) completed a standard 6-min walk test without assistance. No cardiac events were observed. Summed manual muscle testing of 17 muscles, grip power, and percent force vital capacity (%FVC) were significantly reduced (p<0.05), and scores for 6-min walk test and gross motor function measure were decreased (p<0.1) after one year. The decrement in %FVC was significant among non-ambulant patients, whereas the decrement in grip power tended to be greater among ambulant patients. The 6-min walk test, gross motor function measure, manual muscle testing, grip power, and %FVC reflect annual changes and are thus considered good evaluation tools for clinical trials.
