{"id":64257,"title":"Musculoskeletal involvement in systemic sclerosis.","abstract":"Musculoskeletal (MSK) involvement is a very frequent manifestation of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). There are several reports about clinical trials assessing musculoskeletal involvement in SSc. However, only few controlled studies have been conducted. The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms, clinical and radiographic findings has been assessed. The most important articular (arthralgia, synovitis, contractures), tendon (tendon friction rubs, tenosynovitis) and muscular manifestations (myalgia, muscle weakness, myositis) should be carefully evaluated during the assessment of SSc patients, because these are not only common, but substantially influence the quality of life and some of them also have predictive value concerning disease activity and severity.
