{"id":79336,"title":"Changes in voice onset time and motor speech skills in children following motor speech therapy: Evidence from /pa/ productions.","abstract":"This study evaluated changes in motor speech control and inter-gestural coordination for children with speech sound disorders (SSD) subsequent to Prompts for Restructuring Oral and Muscular Phonetic Targets (PROMPT) intervention. We measured the distribution patterns of voice onset time (VOT) for a voiceless stop (/p/) to examine the changes in inter-gestural coordination. Two standardized tests were used (Verbal Motor Production Assessment for Children (VMPAC), GFTA-2) to assess the changes in motor speech skills and articulation. Data showed positive changes in patterns of VOT with a lower pattern of variability. All children showed significantly higher scores for VMPAC, but only some children showed higher scores for GFTA-2. Results suggest that the proprioceptive feedback provided through PROMPT had a positive influence on speech motor control and inter-gestural coordination in voicing behavior. This set of VOT data for children with SSD adds to our understanding of the speech characteristics underlying speech motor control. Directions for future studies are discussed.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446799","annotations":[{"name":"Speech and language pathology","weight":0.819321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology"},{"name":"Phonetics","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Manner of articulation","weight":0.518633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation"},{"name":"Voice onset time","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_onset_time"},{"name":"Voiceless","weight":0.302141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless"},{"name":"Proprioception","weight":0.281463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception"},{"name":"Plosive","weight":0.279962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive"},{"name":"Phone (phonetics)","weight":0.261626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics)"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0405402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Solid-state drive","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Voice (phonetics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(phonetics)"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Motor control","weight":0.0176653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Targets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targets"},{"name":"Motor cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex"},{"name":"Verbal (rapper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_(rapper)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pa (Maori)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa_(Maori)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Restructuring","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restructuring"}]}
