{"id":77899,"title":"Impact of auditory cortical asymmetry in cochlear implantation.","abstract":"Is there a cochlear implant ear advantage for speech perception? Patients A total number of 68 cochlear implant recipients were evaluated retrospectively. They were 20 adults implanted in right ear, 20 matched adults implanted in left ear while 14 children implanted in right ear and 14 matched children implanted in left ear.Behavioral responses & age based speech perception tests were evaluated at 6 months and 1 year post implantation.Adult showed no statistical difference in all tests at 6 months evaluation while 1 year evaluation showed significant better performance for right implanted group in monosyllabic discrimination test. Children showed statistical significant performance in monosyllabic identification and minimal pairs testes at 6 months evaluation; and in monosyllabic identification only at 1 year evaluation.The present data support that right ear implantation would fasten the development of auditory skills especially in young children, an issue to be considered in unilateral implantation.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24869451","annotations":[{"name":"Ear","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.79547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.728009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.62245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.313936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.258641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Speech perception","weight":0.162801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_perception"},{"name":"Syllable","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Minimal pair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_pair"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Discrimination testing","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_testing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Unilateral hearing loss","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"}]}
