{"id":51861,"title":"Clinical outcomes of diabetic patients at a student-run free clinic project.","abstract":"Our objective was to determine if the quality of care of diabetic patients at a Student-Run Free Clinic Project (SRFCP) meets the standard of care, is comparable with other published outcomes, and whether pertinent diabetic clinical indicators improve over time.The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of diabetic patients at three University of California-San Diego (UCSD) SRFCP sites from December 1, 2008 to December 1, 2009 (n=182), calculated the percentage who received recommended screening tests, percent at goal, and compared these to published outcomes using Fisher's exact tests. Baseline measures were compared to most recent values using paired t tests.The percentage of patients who received recommended screening tests (process measures) was blood pressure (BP) 100%, HbA1c 99.5%, creatinine 99.5%, LDL 93%, HDL and triglycerides 88%, microalbumin/creatinine ratio 80%, and ophthalmology exam 32%. Intermediate outcomes included: 70% of patients were at LDL goal <100, 70% had microalbumin/creatinine ratio <30, 61% of males were at HDL goal %gt;40, 47% of females at HDL goal>50, 52% with triglycerides <150, 45% had BP <130/80, and 30% of patients had HbA1c <7. Mean HbA1c, LDL, HDL, triglycerides and blood pressure improved significantly over time.Diabetic patients at UCSD SRFCP reached goals for both process measures and intermediate outcomes at rates that meet or exceed published outcomes of insured and uninsured diabetics on nearly all measures, with the exception of ophthalmology screening. Glycemic control, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure improved significantly during care at the UCSD SRFCP.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652638","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.718697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.701005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.667143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.525881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.424595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.369646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.223931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"University of California, San Diego","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"December 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_1"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Free (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_(band)"},{"name":"Cardiac marker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_marker"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Gross tonnage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage"},{"name":"Free clinic","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_clinic"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"}]}
