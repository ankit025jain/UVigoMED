{"id":11058,"title":"Oxidative stress and schizophrenia: recent breakthroughs from an old story.","abstract":"Oxidative stress has become an exciting area of schizophrenia research, and provides ample opportunities and hope for a better understanding of its pathophysiology, which may lead to novel treatment strategies. This review describes how recent methodological advances have allowed the study of oxidative stress to tackle fundamental questions and have provided several conceptual breakthroughs to the field.Recent human studies support the notion that intrinsic susceptibility to oxidative stress may underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. More than one animal model that may be relevant to study the biology of schizophrenia also shows sign of oxidative stress in the brain.These advances have made this topic of paramount importance to the understanding of schizophrenia and will play a role in advancing the treatment options. This review covers topics from the classic biochemical studies of human biospecimens to the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and novel mouse models, and focuses on highlighting the promising areas of research.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613987","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.658555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.607118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.541009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.459522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","weight":0.44997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.232807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.225887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.156125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.147222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.138184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Magnetic susceptibility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Field (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)"}]}
