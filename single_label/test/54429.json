{"id":54429,"title":"Management of adrenal cancer: a 2013 update.","abstract":"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a devastating tumor for either patients or their families because of short life expectancy and severe impact on quality of life. Due to the rarity of ACC, with a reported annual incidence of 0.5-2 cases per million population, progress in the development of treatment options beyond surgery has been limited. Up to now, no personalized approach of ACC therapy has emerged, apart from plasma level-guided mitotane therapy, and no simple targetable molecular event has been identified from preclinical studies. Complete surgical removal of ACC is the only potentially curative approach and has the most important impact on patientâ€™s prognosis. Despite the limits of the available evidence, adjuvant mitotane therapy is currently recommended in many expert centers whenever the patients present an elevated risk of recurrence. The management of patients with recurrent and metastatic disease is challenging and the prognosis is often poor. Mitotane monotherapy is indicated in the management of patients with a low tumor burden and/or more indolent disease while patients whose disease show an aggressive behavior need cytotoxic chemotherapy. The treatment of patients with advanced ACC may include loco-regional approaches such as surgery and radiofrequency ablation in addition to systemic therapies. The present review provides an updated overview of the management of ACC patients following surgery and of the management of ACC patients with advanced disease.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458831","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.637738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.547641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.449442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.419817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Mitotane","weight":0.413707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitotane"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adrenal tumor","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_tumor"},{"name":"Adrenocortical carcinoma","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocortical_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0337327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"}]}
