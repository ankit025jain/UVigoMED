{"id":76580,"title":"[Bone metabolism and cardiovascular function update. Role of vitamin D in the bone and vascular intercommunication].","abstract":"Vascular calcification, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy have been often complicated in osteoporotic patients with low bone mass. Since there are many similarities among the processes of bone formation and vascular calcification, vitamin D insufficiency has been thought to be deeply involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Indeed, in animal studies, vitamin D receptor gene knockout mice have been shown to display severe vascular calcification, high blood pressure, and left ventricular hypertrophy. On the other hand, in clinical studies, active vitamin D restores vascular calcification and improves heart function in dialysis patients. Whether 1,25 (OH) ?D? acts directly on vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes or acts indirectly on them via regulating calcium metabolism remains unclear. The elucidation of the role of vitamin D in the bone and vascular intercommunication and its application toward drug development could be an important step forward in the realization of health and longevity society.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24976055","annotations":[{"name":"Calcitriol
