{"id":61228,"title":"Elevated TIM3+ hematopoietic stem cells in untreated myelodysplastic syndrome displayed aberrant differentiation, overproliferation and decreased apoptosis.","abstract":"TIM3, as a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity, is highly expressed on LSCs, but not on normal HSCs. TIM3 on HSCs in MDS patients has not been clarified. Here, both the percentage of TIM3 on HSCs and the MFI of TIM3+ HSCs were higher in untreated MDS than control and were closed to AML, and excessive TIM3+ HSCs was closely related to clinical parameters: WPSS score, karyotype analysis, morphologic blasts, the number of cytopenia involving hematopoietic lineages, anemia and granulocytopenia. TIM3+ HSCs expressed lower CD11b, TpoR, EpoR, G-CSFR and Annexin V, and higher CD71 and GATA2. TIM3+ HSCs displayed aberrant differentiation, overproliferation and decreased apoptosis. TIM3 might be a promising marker for identifying malignant clone cells in MDS and a candidate for targeted therapy.
