{"id":46564,"title":"Reducing the gastroesophageal reflux with lip-type reinforcement technique during intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy.","abstract":"Gastroesophageal reflux is a significant problem after esophagogastrostomy, and impact considerably upon the quality of patients' lives. Aims of this study were to evaluate the operative effects in prevention of reflux with lip-type reinforcement during intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis.From January 2005 to December 2009, 216 patients received circular stapled esophagogastrostomy with lip-type reinforcement (LR group), and 69 patients with standard reinforcement (SR group) at our hospital. Major observation parameters were symptoms of reflux and dysphagia.No differences in clinicopathologic characteristics between two groups, in addition to the incidence of anastomotic leakage was less in LR group (p = 0.039). Grade of dysphagia and anastomotic stricture also were not different between two groups (p >0.05). Symptoms of reflux were better controlled in patients with lip-type reinforcement than standard reinforcement (p <0.001). In LR group, 71.3% were asymptomatic with respect to reflux compared to 29.7% in SR group (p <0.001). The incidence of reflux esophagitis was 23.5% in LR group and 58.3% in SR group (p <0.001). There was a significant correlation between reflux symptoms and endoscopic findings of reflux esophagitis (p = 0.001).Lip-type reinforcement is simple to perform, and effective in controlling gastroesophageal reflux and decreasing anastomotic leakage in majority of patients after esophagogastrostomy.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627923","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.538562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.422903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.383838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Staple (fastener)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_(fastener)"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"}]}
