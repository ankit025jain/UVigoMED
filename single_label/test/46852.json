{"id":46852,"title":"[Comparative of gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors of CT virtual endoscopy and pathology].","abstract":"To observe the lower gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors CT virtual endoscopy and pathology, and to explore its possible mechanism.Select 80 patients suspected colon gastroenterology treat in the hospital gastroenterology department, randomly divided into experimental group and control group, 40 cases in experimental group were given CT virtual endoscopy and pathological check, the control group received conventional colonoscopy and pathological check, and all the results compared with the pathological results.Compared with the pathological test results, consistent rate with the experimental group reached 94.73%, the same rate was 92.85% in control group. The difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).CT virtual endoscopy can quickly image and draw detailed information, and can improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis greatly. Clinically, CT virtual endoscopy have the same function as colonoscopy, can replace colonoscopy, can be important complement of electronic colonoscopy by those who cannot tolerate electronic colonoscopy or have contraindications. Its value is worth taking a step forward in-depth study.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617224","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.673635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.34328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.206273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}]}
