{"id":13256,"title":"Selection of an aptamer against rabies virus: a new class of molecules with antiviral activity.","abstract":"Rabies is a fatal central nervous system (CNS) disease caused by the neurotropic rabies virus (RABV). The therapeutic management of RABV infections is still problematic, and novel antiviral strategies are urgently required. We established the RVG-BHK-21 cell line, which expresses RABV glycoprotein on the cell surface, to select aptamers. Through 28 iterative rounds of selection, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers were generated by exponential enrichment (SELEX). A virus titer assay and a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that four aptamers could inhibit the replication of RABV in cultured baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells. However, the aptamers did not inhibit the replication of other virus, e.g., canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine parvovirus (CPV). In addition, the GE54 aptamer was found to effectively protect mice against lethal RABV challenge. After inoculation with aptamers for 24h or 48h, followed by inoculation with CVS-11, approximately 25-33% of the mice survived. In summary, we selected aptamers that could significantly protect from a lethal dose of RABV in vitro and in vivo.
