{"id":23440,"title":"Development of a standardized process improvement protocol to address elevated health care-associated infection rates on an incented quality scorecard.","abstract":"This practice forum report details a standardized improvement process that was created both to improve patient outcomes related to various hospital-acquired infections and to address leadership concerns related to incented quality metrics. A 3-year retrospective review identified common issues to guide future interventions and confirmed that this methodology reduced the rate of recurrent infections across the health care system. Process tool samples are provided.
