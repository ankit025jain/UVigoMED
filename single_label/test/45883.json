{"id":45883,"title":"Management of diaphragmatic peritoneal carcinomatosis: surgical anatomy guidelines and results.","abstract":"Surgical resections, such as peritoneal stripping (peritonectomy) or full-thickness resection of the diaphragm (FTDR), are performed for disseminated diaphragmatic lesions in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). This article presents the anatomical steps of diaphragmatic surgery in order to avoid intraoperative and postoperative complications and to decrease the morbidity and mortality of cytoreductive surgery in patients with PC.
