{"id":3562,"title":"[68Ga-DOTA-PET for neuroendocrine tumours].","abstract":"Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are found in several organs and called NET tumors. They are relatively rare, most of them giving no symptoms and remaining undetected. Most NETs arise from the gut, stomach and bronchus. These tumors are diagnosed either by histology or by imaging. A typical feature of NETs is abundance of somatostatin receptors on the cell surface, which makes it possible to image the tumor by nuclear methods as well as estimate the response to treatment by somatostatin analogues (\"theranostics\"). In order to improve the diagnosis of NETs we started to produce 68Ga-DOTA peptides for PET.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558614","annotations":[{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Bronchus","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.713417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.388885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.251669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Somatostatin receptor","weight":0.047465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin_receptor"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Norepinephrine transporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_transporter"}]}
