{"id":77735,"title":"[Peculiarities of the treatment of the patients presenting with exudative otitis media].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to enhance the effectiveness of provision of medical assistance and to standardize the approaches to its realization for the patients presenting with exudative otitis media (EOM). A total of 67 children (103 cases) at the age varying from 11 months and 17 years were available for the examination after the surgical treatment. The secretory phase of exudative otitis media was diagnosed in 23.5% of the children, mucous phase in 68%, and fibrous phase in 8.5%. The results of the study indicate that diagnostics of EOM requires the application of such methods as otomicroscopy, endoscopy, and tympanometry. Computed tomography of temporal bones may be helpful to distinguish between the complicated cases of exudative otitis media and other diseases of the middle ear. Tympanostomy is possible to perform in the secretory phase of the disease and in all the patients at the mucous and fibrous stages. The preferred localization of tympanostomy is thea ntero-inferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane. It is recommended to place long-term ventilation tubes in the children presenting with recurrent EOM and labial or palatal cleft. The authors managed to achieve the 97.6% effectiveness of the surgical treatment of exudative otitis media. The 12-24 month long follow-up period is recommended.
