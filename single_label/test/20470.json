{"id":20470,"title":"A case-control study evaluating RT-PCR/ESI-MS technology compared to direct fluorescent antibody and xTAG RVP PCR.","abstract":"Waste nasopharyngeal swabs (N = 244) were evaluated by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry PLEX-ID Broad Respiratory Virus Surveillance Kit version 2.5 compared to direct fluorescent antibody and xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel for percent agreement, sensitivity, and specificity. Sensitivity and specificity were 91% (111/122) and 95.1% (116/122), respectively. Sensitivity by virus, except parainfluenza, was 92.9-100%, and specificity was 99-100%.
