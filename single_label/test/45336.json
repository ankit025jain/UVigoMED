{"id":45336,"title":"Completely abdominal intersphincteric resection for lower rectal cancer: feasibility and comparison of robot-assisted and open surgery.","abstract":"Most previous studies of intersphincteric resection (ISR) adopted a two-stage procedure involving abdominal and transanal approaches. We performed completely abdominal ISR via open and a robot-assisted (RA) approaches as treatments for lower rectal cancer (LRC). The RA approach might enable deep dissection and facilitate ISR in patients with restrictive pelvic anatomy.A consecutive cohort of 222 LRC patients who underwent completely abdominal ISR (RA ISR, n = 108; open ISR, n = 114) was enrolled prospectively, and their short-term outcomes were evaluated.In a multivariate analysis, ISR was performed more frequently in the RA than in the open group (82.6 vs. 67.9 %, p = 0.008). The number of harvested lymph nodes was >12 in both groups. A positive distal resection margin was not observed in either group, and a positive circumferential resection margin was found in one patient in the RA group. Overall morbidity did not differ between the groups. Moderate to severe sexual dysfunction occurred 2.7-fold more frequently in the open group (p = 0.023) among male patients ?65 years. Mean Wexner's fecal incontinence scores at postoperative months 6 and 12 were greater in the open group than in the RA group (p < 0.05).Completely abdominal ISR may be feasible in the treatment of LRC, based on a short-term study. Furthermore, RA ISR had equivalent oncological outcomes and slightly improved functional recovery relative to open ISR.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687417","annotations":[{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.771483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.722288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.718336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.615269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.228267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.214558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0827578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Resection margin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resection_margin"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Forestry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"LRC (train)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(train)"},{"name":"Completely (Diamond Rio album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_(Diamond_Rio_album)"}]}
