{"id":87530,"title":"Pediatric brainstem hemorrhages after traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"Traumatic brain injuries afflict a large number of pediatric patients. The most severe injuries lead to increased intracranial pressure and herniation, with resultant changes in the brainstem. Traumatic brainstem hemorrhages have previously been associated with poor neurological outcome and fatality. However, this report discusses 2 pediatric patients who sustained severe head trauma with subsequent brainstem hemorrhages, and yet experienced good neurological outcome; the possible mechanism is described.
