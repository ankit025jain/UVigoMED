{"id":65408,"title":"Levels of liver X receptors in testicular biopsies of patients with azoospermia.","abstract":"To determine whether the transcription factors liver X receptors (LXRs) and their downstream genes, which are involved in the regulation of several testicular functions in mouse models, are differentially expressed in testes of men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) or obstructive azoospermia (OA).Prospective study.University hospital.Patients with various types of NOA (n=22) and with OA (n=5).Human testicular biopsies.Transcript levels were measured in testicular biopsies with the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Correlations of LXR mRNA levels with the number of germ cells, the expression of proliferation and apoptosis markers, and the amount of intratesticular lipids and testosterone were evaluated. The localization of LXR? was analyzed by immunofluorescence.LXR mRNA levels were decreased by 49%-98% in NOA specimens and positively correlated with germ cell number. Accumulations of IDOL and SREBP1c (LXR targets involved in lipid homeostasis) were 1.8-2.1 times lower in NOA samples and mRNA levels of the SREBP1c target gene ELOVL6 were increased 1.9-2.4-fold. Interestingly, the amount of triglycerides and free fatty acids were higher in NOA testes (3.4-12.2-fold). LXR? was present in Leydig cells. Accumulations of LXR downstream genes encoding the steroidogenic proteins StAR and 3?HSD2 were higher in NOA testes (5.9-12.8-fold).Knowledge of changes in the transcript levels of LXRs and some of their downstream genes during altered spermatogenesis may help us to better understand the physiopathology of testicular failure in azoospermic patients.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Male
