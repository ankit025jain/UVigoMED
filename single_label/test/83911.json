{"id":83911,"title":"[The preliminary study of gene copy number variation association with scar hyperplasia based on the whole-gene resequencing].","abstract":"To investigate the genome copy number variation (CNV) related with keloid using the whole-gene resequencing technology.A keloid pedigree containing 4 generation of 27 people was studied. Five people (4 cases of keloid patients, and 1 case of normal) were selected to extract the genomic DNA. Then the whole-gene resequencing technique was used to check the variations based on the Illumina Hiseq 2000.Through database comparison and variation annotation analysis, 15 CNVs associated with scar hyperplasia were obtained. DAVID software was used to do the Gene Ontology and pathway analysis. Five CNVs were closely related to the keloid formation. They were growth factor receptor-bound 7 (Grb7), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 15 (MAP3K15), kruppel-like factors 7 (KLF7) and NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2-2). These CNVs were involved in the process of epidermal cells formation and differentiation, cell exocrine and cell adhesion.There are 5 CNVs associated with scar hyperplasia. Especially MAP3K15 and MAP4K4 deserve more research to find their function in keloid formation.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
