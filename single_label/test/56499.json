{"id":56499,"title":"Causes and characteristics of horizontal positional nystagmus.","abstract":"Direction changing horizontal positional nystagmus can be observed in a variety of central and peripheral vestibular disorders. We tested sixty subjects with horizontal positional nystagmus and vertigo on the Epley Omniax(®) rotator. Monocular video recordings were performed with the right or left ear down, in the supine and prone positions. Nystagmus slow-phase velocity (SPV) was plotted as a function of time. Thirty-one subjects diagnosed with horizontal canalolithiasis had paroxysmal horizontal geotropic nystagmus with the affected ear down (onset 0.8 ± 1 s, range 0-4.9 s, duration 11.7-47.9 s, peak SPV 79 ± 67°/s). The SPV peaked at 5-20 s and declined to 0 by 60 s; at 40 s from onset, the average SPV was 1.8 % of the peak. Nine subjects diagnosed with cupulolithiasis had persistent apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus (onset 0.7 ± 1.4 s, range 0-4.3 s). Peak SPV was 54.2 ± 31.8°/s and 26.6 ± 12.2°/s with unaffected and affected ears down, respectively. At 40 s, the average SPV had decayed to only 81 % (unaffected ear down) and 65 % (affected ear down) of the peak. Twenty subjects were diagnosed with disorders other than benign positional vertigo (BPV) [vestibular migraine (VM), Ménière's Disease, vestibular schwannoma, unilateral or bilateral peripheral vestibular loss]. Subjects with VM (n = 13) had persistent geotropic or apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus. On average, at 40 s from nystagmus onset, the SPV was 61 % of the peak. Two patients with Ménière's Disease had persistent apogeotropic horizontal nystagmus; the peak SPV at 40 s ranged between 28.6 and 49.5 % of the peak. Symptomatic horizontal positional nystagmus can be observed in canalolithiasis, cupulolithiasis and diverse central and peripheral vestibulopathies; its temporal and intensity profile could be helpful in the separation of these entities.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676938","annotations":[{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.91736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","weight":0.518989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo"},{"name":"Pathologic nystagmus","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_nystagmus"},{"name":"Vestibular schwannoma","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_schwannoma"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.263423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Migraine-associated vertigo","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine-associated_vertigo"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monocular","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocular"},{"name":"Gravitropism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitropism"},{"name":"SPV GmbH","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPV_GmbH"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"VM (operating system)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Orbital decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Boeing 747","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ottawa 67's","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_67's"},{"name":"Prone position","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prone_position"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"}]}
