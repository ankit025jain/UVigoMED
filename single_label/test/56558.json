{"id":56558,"title":"Combined treatment for Coats' disease: retinal laser photocoagulation combined with intravitreal bevacizumab injection was effective in two cases.","abstract":"The exact pathogenetic mechanisms of Coats' disease remain unknown. In this report, we show two cases of Coats' disease that achieved a favorable prognosis with the combined treatment of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection prior to photocoagulation, although both initially resisted photocoagulation therapy.Case 1 was a 15-year-old boy with initial visual acuity of 0.4 OD. At the temporal retina, aneurysms and abnormal telangiectatic vessels were observed. Hard exudates and an exudative retinal detachment extended to the fovea. He was diagnosed as having Coats' disease at stage 3A and we performed laser photocoagulation as an initial approach to treat peripheral aneurysms and telangiectatic vessels. After the treatment, the exudative retinal detachment was eased and visual acuity improved to 1.0; however, recurrence occurred after 5 months. The exudative change was resistant against laser photocoagulation therapy and we therefore added IVB as an adjuvant before photocoagulation. Fourteen days after IVB injection phased laser photocoagulation was given to cover the abnormal capillaries, aneurysms and the leakage area spotted in FA. A good prognosis was obtained with decreased exudation and improved visual acuity.Case 2 was an 11-year-old boy with decreased visual acuity of 0.15 OS at the initial visit. Hard exudates, retinal edema and serous retinal detachment were seen at the macula and peripheral retina. Fluorescein angiography revealed telangiectatic capillaries at the temporal retina. Our diagnosis was Coats' disease at stage 3A. Extensive photocoagulation was performed as an initial treatment to the lesion. However, the exudative change was severe and resistant against the photocoagulation treatment. Therefore, we added IVB as an adjuvant before photocoagulation. Exudative change in the retina seemed to be eased 7 days after IVB injection, therefore, phased laser phototherapy was added to cover the abnormal capillaries. After the combination therapy, exudative change was remarkably ameliorated and better visual acuity was achieved.Bevacizumab is considered an effective adjuvant for Coats' disease with exudative change resistant to retinal photocoagulation therapy.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666524","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.759912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.722455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.679299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.566321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.548184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.540675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.363164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.338922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.334498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.315682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"}]}
