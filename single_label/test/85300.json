{"id":85300,"title":"Advances in the therapy of hyperoxia-induced lung injury: findings from animal models.","abstract":"Oxygen therapy is one of the most widely used clinical interventions to counteract insufficient pulmonary oxygen delivery in patients with severe lung injury. However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia at elevated partial pressure leads to inflammation and acute lung injury. The population at risk for this condition has markedly increased with the advent of efficient systems for delivery of high concentrations of oxygen in hospitals. Thus, the therapy of hyperoxia-induced lung injury has been a focus in studies of pediatrics and pulmonary medicine. In this paper, we briefly summarized the advances in the therapies of hyperoxia-induced lung injury on the basis of its pathogenesis. We hope our summary will help provide evidence for further investigation of therapeutic measures for hyperoxia-induced lung injury.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984313","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.785924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.703992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.386317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.354724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hyperoxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoxia"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"}]}
