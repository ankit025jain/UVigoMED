{"id":83244,"title":"Erosion/abrasion-preventing potential of NaF and F/Sn/chitosan toothpastes in dentine and impact of the organic matrix.","abstract":"The study investigated the erosion/abrasion-preventing potential of experimental NaF (1,400 ppm F(-)) and amine fluoride (AmF)/NaF/SnCl2/chitosan (1,400 ppm F(-), 3,500 ppm Sn(2+), 0.5% chitosan) toothpastes relative to placebo and SnF2 gel (970 ppm F(-), 3,000 ppm Sn(2+)), and the impact of the demineralised dentine matrix on toothpaste effects. The study was a cyclic erosion/intervention experiment (10 days). Samples were stored in mineral salt solution either without or with collagenase (from Clostridium histolyticum type VII; 100 U/ml) for continuous removal of the organic matrix. To produce a comparable order of tissue loss, erosion was performed 6 × 30 s/day with 0.5% citric acid in the latter and 6 × 90 s/day with 1% citric acid in the former. Intervention was toothpaste slurry immersion (2 × 2 min/day); half of the samples were additionally brushed for 15 s within this time (brushing machine, load 200 g). Tissue loss was determined profilometrically (mean ± SD; µm). Tissue loss values (without/with brushing) for placebo, NaF, AmF/NaF/SnCl2/chitosan and SnF2 gel, respectively, were 11.6 ± 3.1/12.2 ± 2.5, 12.7 ± 3.1/10.7 ± 4.5, 8.7 ± 2.1/9.7 ± 2.1 and 8.8 ± 1.8/?10.9 ± 1.8 in the presence of the organic matrix and 10.7 ± 3.2/11.9 ± 2.1, 8.2 ± 4.0/10.1 ± 4.1, 8.7 ± 2.9/9.1 ± 1.8 and 8.4 ± 1.9/7.5 ± 1.5 in the absence of the organic matrix. Relative to placebo, the NaF formulation had no significant effects; the AmF/NaF/SnCl2/chitosan formulation significantly reduced tissue loss between 20 and 25% except when applied without brushing in the absence of the organic matrix. The effects of the formulations were similar both in the presence and absence of the organic matrix. Sn(2+)/F(-)-?containing formulations have the potential to reduce erosion/abrasion even in the absence of demineralised collagen; seeking for more effective formulations is desirable.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401756","annotations":[{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.855062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Dietary mineral","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.768176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.762391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.707053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.699719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Citric acid","weight":0.678041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.658078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tin","weight":0.37025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"},{"name":"Purified water","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water"},{"name":"Tin(II) fluoride","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_fluoride"},{"name":"Slurry","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.118291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0450952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Chitosan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitosan"},{"name":"Collagenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenase"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"}]}
