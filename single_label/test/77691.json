{"id":77691,"title":"Consortium for health and military performance and American College of Sports Medicine Summit: utility of functional movement assessment in identifying musculoskeletal injury risk.","abstract":"Prevention of musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) is critical in both civilian and military populations to enhance physical performance, optimize health, and minimize health care expenses. Developing a more unified approach through addressing identified movement impairments could result in improved dynamic balance, trunk stability, and functional movement quality while potentially minimizing the risk of incurring such injuries. Although the evidence supporting the utility of injury prediction and return-to-activity readiness screening tools is encouraging, considerable additional research is needed regarding improving sensitivity, specificity, and outcomes, and especially the implementation challenges and barriers in a military setting. If selected current functional movement assessments can be administered in an efficient and cost-effective manner, utilization of the existing tools may be a beneficial first step in decreasing the burden of MSKI, with a subsequent focus on secondary and tertiary prevention via further assessments on those with prior injury history.
