{"id":5091,"title":"[Locking plate percutaneous external fixation for the treatment of pediatric tibial fractures].","abstract":"To explore treatment effect of the locking plate percutaneous external fixation to tibial fractures.From July 2010 to February 2013, 8 cases with pediatric tibial fractures were treated by using unilateral locking plate percutaneous external fixation,including 6 males and 2 females with an average age of 7 years old ranging from 4 to 10. Among them, 5 cases were open fractures involving 1 case of Gustilo-Anderson type II, 3 cases of type III A, 1 case of type III B; and the other 3 cases were closed fractures involving 2 cases of AO type A3, 1 cases of type B2. The postoperative bone healing and gait impact were observed and the function was evaluated by Johner-Wruhs scores.All fractures healed successfully without infection. The fracture healing time was from 3 to 6 months with an average of 3.9 months. The locking plate removal time was from 4 to 7 months with an average of 4.3 months. Among them, 7 cases were visually normal after walking with stand, 1 case of anterior tibial tendon defect affected gait. The results of Johner-Wruhs assessment were excellent in 7 cases, good in 1 case. No rub contralateral medial calf skin wounds occurenced.The method is simple, stable and reliable. The fixation strength is suitable for children using locking plate percutaneous external fixation. The postoperative functional recovery was excellent and the walking gait was less affected. But the point of LCP pedicle screw should be carefully selected before installation with good skin coverage.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338449","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.810022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.659759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.558217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.360409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.187925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.155226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0568689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Anterior tibial artery","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_tibial_artery"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Calfskin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calfskin"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Installation art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_art"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Joint lock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_lock"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Calf (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"}]}
