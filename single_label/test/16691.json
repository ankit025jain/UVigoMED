{"id":16691,"title":"[Childhood septic arthritis].","abstract":"Childhood acute septic arthritis is most often of hematogenous origin, and usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Characteristic symptoms and signs include a swollen, red painful joint, and fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by a joint aspiration. Following a brief 2- to 4-day intravenous phase, the antibiotic course is completed orally to a total of 10 to 14 days. Cephalosporins, clindamycin or staphylococcal penicillins, administered every 6 hours, are recommended as first-line antibiotics because of their appropriate spectrum, excellent penetration, good tolerability in large doses, and moderate price. Operative treatment (arthroscopy, arthrotomy) is not needed routinely, unless the response is tardy.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964493","annotations":[{"name":"Clindamycin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clindamycin"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.868043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.725212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.420441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Arthrocentesis","weight":0.30814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrocentesis"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
