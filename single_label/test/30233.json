{"id":30233,"title":"HealthCall for the smartphone: technology enhancement of brief intervention in HIV alcohol dependent patients.","abstract":"Heavy drinking jeopardizes the health of patients in HIV primary care. In alcohol dependent patients in HIV primary care, a technological enhancement of brief intervention, HealthCall administered via interactive voice response (HealthCall-IVR) was effective at reducing heavy drinking. The smartphone offered a technology platform to improve HealthCall.Working with input from patients, technology experts, and HIV clinic personnel, we further developed HealthCall, harnessing smartphone technological capacities (HealthCall-S). In a pilot study, we compared rates of HealthCall-S daily use and drinking outcomes in 41 alcohol dependent HIV-infected patients with the 43 alcohol dependent HIV-infected patients who used HealthCall-IVR in our previous efficacy study. Procedures, clinic, personnel, and measures were largely the same in the two studies, and the two groups of patients were demographically similar (~90% minority).Pilot patients used HealthCall-S a median of 85.0% of the 60 days of treatment, significantly greater than the corresponding rate (63.8%) among comparison patients using HealthCall-IVR (p?<?.001). Mean end-of-treatment drinks per drinking day was similar in the two groups. Patients were highly satisfied with HealthCall-S (i.e., 92% reported that they liked using HealthCall-S).Among alcohol dependent patients in HIV primary care, HealthCall delivered via smartphone is feasible, obtains better patient engagement than HealthCall-IVR, and is associated with decreased drinking. In HIV primary care settings, HealthCall-S may offer a way to improve drinking outcomes after brief intervention by extending patient engagement with little additional demands on staff time.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533631","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.711419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.583707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.46932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.270433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.261574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.145853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Interactive voice response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response"},{"name":"Smartphone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Engagement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement"},{"name":"Party platform","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform"},{"name":"Interactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"}]}
