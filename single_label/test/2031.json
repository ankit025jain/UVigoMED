{"id":2031,"title":"[Minimally invasive interventions in the treatment of patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis].","abstract":"Improve outcomes in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis by the differential application of minimally invasive interventions.The results of treatment of 97 patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis requiring minimally invasive surgical intervention were retrospectively analyzed. Percutaneous catheter drainage were used in 76.2% of cases. All patients were divided into two groups based on the effectiveness of minimally invasive interventions.Minimally invasive interventions were the final method of surgical treatment in the 69 patients (1st group). Patients of 2nd group (28.9%) underwent additional traditional surgical necrosectomy. The overall mortality rate was 9.7%. In 1st group died 5 patients (7.2%), in the 2nd--4 (14.3%). Complications of percutaneous catheter drainage (bleeding, damage to organs, catheter dislodgement) were found in 18.1%.The use of minimally invasive techniques in combination with conservative therapy can decrease treatment time, the rate of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518497","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.751024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.59757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.594972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.303362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"January 22","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_22"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Method (computer programming)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
