{"id":77432,"title":"Methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone allergies can be detected by 200 ppm of methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone patch test concentration.","abstract":"Methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) and methylisothiazolinone (MI) contact allergies are rising dramatically. Moreover, 100 ppm of MCI/MI patch test might not detect an important number of MCI/MI and MI allergies.This study aimed to present the prevalence of contact allergy to both preservatives in an area of Spain and to investigate if 100 ppm of MCI/MI is an adequate concentration for a proper diagnosis.A prospective study was conducted from October 2011 to September 2013. All patients were patch tested with the Spanish baseline series (containing 100 ppm of MCI/MI) and with 200 ppm of MCI/MI and 2000 ppm of MI.A total of 490 patients were patch tested. The MCI/MI prevalence was 10% and increased from 7.8% in last term of 2011 to 14.3% in the first 9 months of 2013. The MI prevalence was 4.5% and increased from 1% to 7.7% in the same period. One hundred parts per million of MCI/MI could not diagnose 24.5% of MCI/MI allergies. All MI allergies were detected by 200 ppm of MCI/MI, whereas only 68.2% were positive to 100-ppm concentration.For a correct diagnosis of MCI/MI and MI contact allergies, we advocate increasing the MCI/MI patch test concentration to 200 ppm along with a temporal inclusion of MI in the North American Contact Dermatitis Group baseline series.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819287","annotations":[{"name":"Spain","weight":0.765384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.309099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.30861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.302928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Preservative","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preservative"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Methylisothiazolinone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylisothiazolinone"},{"name":"Patch test (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_test_(medicine)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Baseline (surveying)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(surveying)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Advocate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"}]}
