{"id":67882,"title":"Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of prostate cancer with a gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist--from mice to men.","abstract":"Ex vivo studies have shown that the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) is overexpressed on almost all primary prostate cancers, making it a promising target for prostate cancer imaging and targeted radiotherapy.Biodistribution, dosimetry and tumor uptake of the GRPr antagonist ??Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06 [(??Cu-4,11-bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo(6.6.2)hexadecane)-PEG?-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-LeuNH?] were studied by PET/CT in four patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (T1c-T2b, Gleason 6-7).No adverse events were observed after injection of ??Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06. Three of four tumors were visualized with high contrast [tumor-to-prostate ratio > 4 at 4 hours (h) post injection (p.i.)], one small tumor (T1c, < 5% tumor on biopsy specimens) showed moderate contrast (tumor-to-prostate ratio at 4 h: 1.9). Radioactivity was cleared by the kidneys and only the pancreas demonstrated significant accumulation of radioactivity, which rapidly decreased over time.??Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06 shows very favorable characteristics for imaging prostate cancer. Future studies evaluating ??Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06 PET/CT for prostate cancer detection, staging, active surveillance, and radiation treatment planning are necessary.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578724","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Gastrin","weight":0.760569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrin"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.70387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.621393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.570497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.477896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Dosimetry","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Gastrin-releasing peptide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrin-releasing_peptide"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
