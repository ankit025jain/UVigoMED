{"id":77827,"title":"The swing-door island flap canalplasty technique.","abstract":"This article describes a new canalplasty technique for the treatment of symptoms resulting from chronic refractory otitis externa.We report on our experience using a swing-door island flap and a periosteal flap. Thirteen patients underwent treatment and a total of 19 ears were operated on. The range of preoperative symptoms was 3 to 22 years (mean length of symptoms = 12 years).The postoperative course in all the patients showed this to be a satisfactory treatment with no recurrence of symptoms.The swing-door island flap canalplasty technique is an effective surgical treatment in patients with refractory otitis externa.","date":"2014-11-18","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24944277","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.367444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.356263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.20626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Otitis externa","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_externa"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
