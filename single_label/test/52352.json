{"id":52352,"title":"Evaluation of one- and two-photon activated photodynamic therapy with pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester in human cervical, lung and ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"Two-photon activated photodynamic therapy (2-? PDT) has the potential of treating deeper tumors and/or improving tumor targeting. Here, we evaluated the one- and two-photon activated PDT efficacy of pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester (MPPa), a second-generation photosensitizer derived from chlorophyll a. We show that MPPa, when activated by femtosecond (fs) laser pulses at 674 nm, has high one-photon (1-?) PDT efficacy against cisplatin-sensitive human cervical (HeLa) and cisplatin-resistant human lung (A549) and ovarian (NIH:OVCAR-3) cancer cells. At a low light dose of 0.06 J cm(-2), the IC50 (the MPPa concentration required to kill 50% of the cells) was determined to be 5.3 ± 0.3, 3.4 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.4 ?M for HeLa, A549 and NIH:OVCAR-3 cells, respectively. More significantly, we also show that MPPa can be effectively activated by an 800 nm, 120 fs laser through 2-? excitation; at a light dose causing no measurable photocytotoxicity in the absence of photosensitizer, the corresponding IC50 values were measured to be 4.1 ± 0.3, 9.6 ± 1.0 and 1.6 ± 0.3 ?M, respectively. These results indicate that MPPa is a potent photosensitizer for both 1- and 2-? activated PDT with potential applications for difficult-to-treat tumors by conventional therapies.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607610","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.889068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"HeLa","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.732141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chlorophyll","weight":0.700486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.598791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.550483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.503792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.480921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.36082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.357516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.315301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.232798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Excited state","weight":0.127312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pulse (legume)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(legume)"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Photosensitizer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitizer"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"}]}
