{"id":44369,"title":"Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy: comparing the arthrotomy knife to the Bovie blade.","abstract":"Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy was performed at our institution using an arthrotomy knife until it became unavailable in 2010. Thus, we adapted the use of the blunt Bovie tip, which can be used with or without electrocautery to perform the myotomy. This study compared the outcomes between using the arthrotomy knife versus the Bovie blade in laparoscopic pyloromyotomies.Retrospective review was performed on all laparoscopic pyloromyotomy patients from October 2007 to September 2012. Arthrotomy knife pyloromyotomy patients were compared with those performed with the Bovie blade. Patient demographics, diagnostic measurements, electrolyte levels, length of stay, operative time, and complications were compared.A total of 381 patients were included, with 191 in the arthrotomy group and 190 in the Bovie blade group. No significant differences existed between groups in age, weight, gender, pyloric dimensions, electrolyte levels, or length of stay. Mean operative times were 15.8±5.6 min with knife and 16.4±5.3 min for Bovie blade (P=0.24). In the arthrotomy knife group, there was one incomplete pyloromyotomy and one omental herniation. There was one wound infection in each group. Readmission rate was greater in the arthrotomy knife group (5.7%) versus the Bovie blade group (3.1%).The Bovie blade appears to offer no objective disadvantages compared with the arthrotomy knife when performing laparoscopic pyloromyotomy.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739509","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cauterization","weight":0.644417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.473664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.386848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pyloromyotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyloromyotomy"},{"name":"Myotomy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotomy"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Electrosurgery","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrosurgery"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Knife","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"381","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/381"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Blade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Greater omentum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"},{"name":"Atucha II Nuclear Power Plant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atucha_II_Nuclear_Power_Plant"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Pylorus","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Group 5 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_5_element"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"}]}
