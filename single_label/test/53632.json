{"id":53632,"title":"[Investigation of cytokeratin and vimentin intermediate filaments in polycystic ovaries (PCOS) -- presence and specific structure of Balbiani body in primordial follicles].","abstract":"Despite of the importance of cytoskeletal proteins for ovarian function and pathology, very few studies have addressed the presence and distribution of these proteins in polycystic ovaries. We investigated sections of human polycystic ovarian tissue for vimentin and a set of cytokeratins by epifluorescence. The studied proteins showed strong colocalization. Positive reaction was detected in two main ovarian compartments: with weak intensity in follicular cells and very strong in perinuclear position in oocytes of primordial follicles. Epifluorescent study of the oocytes from primordial follicles allowed us to identify the immunopositive structure in oocytes as Balbiani body, a transient organelle responsible for establishing oocyte polarity and ooplasm gradients in nonmammalian vertebrates. Our results suggest functional interaction of different types of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins in polycystic ovaries and a possible importance of the Balbiani body for human oogenesis in norm and pathology.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505633","annotations":[{"name":"Organelle","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"},{"name":"Intermediate filament","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_filament"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Oogenesis","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oogenesis"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.808394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ovum","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovum"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.69692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Nuclear envelope","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_envelope"},{"name":"Vertebrate","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.54383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Protein filament","weight":0.523128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_filament"},{"name":"Cytokeratin","weight":0.474585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokeratin"},{"name":"Folliculogenesis","weight":0.307422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folliculogenesis"},{"name":"Chemical polarity","weight":0.262061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.167165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.145649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Follicular cell","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_cell"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Abiogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"}]}
