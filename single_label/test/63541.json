G-CSF prophylaxis was given to all patients.Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Twenty of them were male with a median age of 49 years. The majority of patients (66.7%) had PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), and 95.8% of the patients were in stage III or IV. The overall response rate was 58% with 42% having complete response. The response rates were better among patients with ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL; 100%) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL; 85%) than those with PTCL, NOS (44%). With a median follow-up of 21 months, the patients had an estimated 2-year event-free survival, and an overall survival rate of 37.6% and 54.4%, respectively. The most common adverse effects were infection and hematologic toxicities that was manageable.Although CHOEP-21 induced favorable responses in patients with ALK-negative ALCL and AITL, the responses were not durable and further therapy is mandated in management of patients with nodal PTCL.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24428090","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_large-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.770506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Anaplasia","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasia"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.505656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.363236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.128051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Nitrous oxide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Large cell","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cell"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Large-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-cell_lymphoma"}]}
