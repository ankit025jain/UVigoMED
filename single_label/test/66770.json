{"id":66770,"title":"Lower blood vitamin D levels are associated with an increased incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography.","abstract":"Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of renovascular disease. We assessed the correlation between vitamin D levels and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG).Vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were assessed before CAG in 403 patients. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were hydrated with 0.9%-saline at 1 mL/kg/h for 12 hours before and after CAG. CIN was defined as serum creatinine increase of > 0.5 mg/dL or > 25% within 48-72 hours after CAG.CIN developed in 74 participants. Baseline eGFR, blood urea and creatinine in CIN (+) and (-) groups were not significantly different (P = 0.14, P = 0.07, and P = 0.61, respectively). Total volume of contrast medium (CM) was higher in the CIN (+) group (132 ± 64 mL vs 90 ± 41 mL; P = 0.01). Vitamin D levels were lower (median 8.5 [range, 0.5-26.6] ng/mL vs 14.9 [range, 1.9-93.5] ng/mL; P = 0.01) and PTH levels were higher (median 73.9 [range, 22-530] pg/mL vs 44.2 [range, 5-361] pg/mL; P = 0.01) in the CIN (+) group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower vitamin D levels (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.26; P = 0.01) and increased CM volume (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.008-1.017; P = 0.01) were independently correlated with CIN. In patients who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention, lower levels of vitamin D were independently associated with CIN development.Lower vitamin D levels, implying possible vitamin D deficiency, are associated with a higher incidence of CIN.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680172","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.875138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.849269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.765245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.747825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.647422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.638867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.560834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.542431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.533971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.509643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.469097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
