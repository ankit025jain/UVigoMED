{"id":72358,"title":"Absence of caveolin-1 expression in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast predicts poor patient outcome.","abstract":"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression in stromal carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has been associated with tumor progression and clinical outcome. This study was undertaken to assess its prognostic significance in invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast (IMPC), a tumor with abundant stromal CAFs and a high tendency for nodal metastasis and poor outcome. Cav-1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in a group of 86 cases of IMPC along with a control group of 105 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS). Our results indicate that absence of Cav-1 expression in CAFs of IMPC is more common than in IDC-NOS (57 %, 49/86 vs. 36 %, 38/105). The absence of expression was associated with larger tumor size and higher lymph node stage (P?<?0.05) of IMPC. Univariate analysis suggested absence of Cav-1 in CAFs to be a candidate independent predictor of reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (HR?=?3.945, 95 % CI?=?1.717-9.063, P?=?0.001), which was confirmed by multivariable analysis (P?=?0.018). In patients with IMPC spreading to local lymph nodes, loss of stromal Cav-1 predicted a fourfold increase in risk for shortened PFS. In contrast, no significant difference of tumor epithelial Cav-1 expression was found between IMPC and IDC-NOS, and the expression of tumor Cav-1 was not significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with IMPC. Absence of Cav-1 expression in CAFs is a strong prognostic factor for IMPC patients, and it may further subgroup the patients with lymph node metastasis to guide clinical management.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980157","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.716901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Ductal carcinoma","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.554832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.542599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.289303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.279702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.238729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Caveolin","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveolin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
