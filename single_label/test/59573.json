{"id":59573,"title":"IL-5 triggers a cooperative cytokine network that promotes eosinophil precursor maturation.","abstract":"Eosinophils originate in the bone marrow from an eosinophil lineage-committed, IL-5R?-positive, hematopoietic progenitor (eosinophil progenitor). Indeed, IL-5 is recognized as a critical regulator of eosinophilia and has effects on eosinophil progenitors, eosinophil precursors, and mature eosinophils. However, substantial levels of eosinophils remain after IL-5 neutralization or genetic deletion, suggesting that there are alternative pathways for promoting eosinophilia. In this study, we investigated the contributory role of IL-5 accessory cytokines on the final stages of eosinophil differentiation. IL-5 stimulation of low-density bone marrow cells resulted in expression of a panel of cytokines and cytokine receptors, including several ligand-receptor pairs. Notably, IL-4 and IL-4R? were expressed by eosinophil precursors and mature eosinophils. Signaling through IL-4R? promoted eosinophil maturation when IL-5 was present, but IL-4 stimulation in the absence of IL-5 resulted in impaired eosinophil survival, suggesting that IL-4 cooperates with IL-5 to promote eosinophil differentiation. In contrast, CCL3, an eosinophil precursor-produced chemokine that signals through CCR1, promotes terminal differentiation of CCR1-positive eosinophil precursors in the absence of IL-5, highlighting an autocrine loop capable of sustaining eosinophil differentiation. These findings suggest that brief exposure to IL-5 is sufficient to initiate a cytokine cooperative network that promotes eosinophil differentiation of low-density bone marrow cells independent of further IL-5 stimulation.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230753","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.905162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.853044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.807293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.678215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Autocrine signalling","weight":0.632733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.37494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Interleukin-4 receptor","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin-4_receptor"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cytokine receptor","weight":0.333738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_receptor"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.311587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.214399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"CCL3","weight":0.0833675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL3"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Accessory (legal term)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_(legal_term)"},{"name":"Signal (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(physiology)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
