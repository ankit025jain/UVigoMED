{"id":66450,"title":"A retrospective study of end-stage renal disease in captive polar bears (Ursus maritimus).","abstract":"This retrospective study summarizes 11 cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in captive polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from eight zoologic institutions across the United States and Canada. Ten bears were female, one was male, and the mean age at the time of death was 24 yr old. The most common clinical signs were lethargy, inappetence, and polyuria-polydipsia. Biochemical findings included azotemia, anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and isosthenuria. Histologic examination commonly showed glomerulonephropathies and interstitial fibrosis. Based on submissions to a private diagnostic institution over a 16-yr period, ESRD was the most commonly diagnosed cause of death or euthanasia in captive polar bears in the United States, with an estimated prevalence of over 20%. Further research is needed to discern the etiology of this apparently common disease of captive polar bears.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712164","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Euthanasia","weight":0.734224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Azotemia","weight":0.643984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azotemia"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.547122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.535634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.488001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.462785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.215792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hyperphosphatemia","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperphosphatemia"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.083419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Chemical polarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity"},{"name":"Polar bear","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear"}]}
