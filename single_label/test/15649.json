{"id":15649,"title":"[Invasive community-acquired infections in children].","abstract":"The study group consisted of 180 patients who had 186 community-acquired blood-culture positive infections during 2007-June 2013. Three of them died of meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae or N. meningitidis. A ten-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine was introduced in the Finnish National Vaccine Program in 2010. After that the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections decreased markedly. The numbers of resistant S. pneumoniae appeared to decrease slightly, as did also hospitalization due to pneumonia in age group 0 to 2 years. No evidence for serotype replacement was found. The situation requires constant monitoring as the time passes, since the introduction of vaccination is quite recent.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158584","annotations":[{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.553642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.499596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.217545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Pneumococcal vaccine","weight":0.0779046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_vaccine"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
