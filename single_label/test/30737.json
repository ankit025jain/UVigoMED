{"id":30737,"title":"Efficacy of 2years of entecavir plus adefovir therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B who had failed on prior nucleos(t)ide analog treatment.","abstract":"Entecavir (ETV) plus adefovir (ADV) combination therapy may be a promising option for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who have failed on prior nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) treatment. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of this combination are not well-defined. In a single-center, retrospective study, 104 patients (mean age 31.7 years; 88.5% male) with HBV DNA >10(3)IU/mL who had received one or multiple prior NAs for ? 6 months (median 44.5 months) were treated for ? 24 months with ETV (0.5mg/day) plus ADV (10mg/day). Among patients with available samples, 44/90 (48.9%) had drug-resistant mutations. At 2 years, HBV DNA levels were undetectable (<12 IU/mL) in 52/104 (50.0%) patients. The mean HBV DNA level was 2.0 ± 1.2 log 10 IU/mL, and it was decreased by 3.2 ± 2.0 log 10 IU/mL from the pre-combination treatment (V0) value. The 2-year HBeAg loss rate was 14.4% (13/90), HBeAg seroconversion rate was 10.0% (9/90), and ALT normalization rate was 75%. In multivariate analyses, the prior NA treatment duration, the V0 HBV DNA level, and the HBV DNA reduction at 1 year after ETV+ADV therapy were associated with the virological response after 2 years. No patients developed renal impairment, clinical decompensation or new HCC, and no relapses of HCC or deaths occurred. Thus, 2-year rescue therapy with ETV+ADV was effective and well-tolerated in CHB patients who had previously failed on multiple NA treatments. The HBV DNA level just before ETV+ADV combination therapy and the decrease of HBV DNA at 1 year could predict the efficacy of 2 years of ETV+ADV treatment.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462954","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.579805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.570054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.413181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.313385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Adefovir","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adefovir"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.098427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"1390","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1390"},{"name":"990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/990"},{"name":"Lumber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Eesti Televisioon","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Televisioon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Charlotte Bobcats","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
