{"id":37250,"title":"[Dandy-Walker complex: a clinicopathologic study of 9 cases].","abstract":"To investigate the etiology, pathogenesis, clinicopathologic characteristics, clinical prognosis and treatment of Dandy-Walker syndrome.Nine cases of Dandy-Walker syndrome were included in the study. The autopsy findings and clinical history were evaluated along with review of the literature. The causes, pathogenetic mechanism, pathologic features and prognosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome were analyzed.Among 9 Dandy-Walker syndrome cases, six patients presented with variants of Dandy-Walker complex and 3 cases had classic Dandy-Walker malformation. In addition, 4 patients presented with combined lateral ventricle expansion and multiple malformations were seen in 7 cases. Combined umbilical cord abnormality was noted in 4 patients with variant of Dandy-Walker complex and combined placental abnormality was seen in one classic Dandy-Walker syndrome.Dandy-Walker syndrome is a rare disease. In addition to complex pathogenesis with possible genetic and environmental antigenic etiologies, placental and umbilical cord abnormality may be also related to its development.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507099","annotations":[{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.620188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.310402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.255407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.141651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lateral ventricles","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_ventricles"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
