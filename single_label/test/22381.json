{"id":22381,"title":"[Progression of endophthalmitis clinical characteristics and coping strategy of bacterial post-vitrectomy].","abstract":"Bacterial endophthalmitis is a real rare complication, perhaps the most devastating one,following pars plana vitrectomy. The most common organism responsible for it is coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Potential predisposing factors of post-vitrectomy endophthalmitis are majorly coming from surgical procedures and compromising of the immune system. Preoperative povidone-iodine preparation received the clinical recommendation for prophylactic interventions. The main choices of bacterial endophthalmitis treatments are intravitreal injection of antibiotics according to etiological diagnoses and vitrectomy.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555214","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.675724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.666938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.427343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.315796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Endophthalmitis","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophthalmitis"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Plana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plana"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
