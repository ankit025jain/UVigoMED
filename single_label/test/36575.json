{"id":36575,"title":"Prenatal sonographic diagnosis of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts.","abstract":"The incidence of fetal portosystemic anastomoses is unknown, and it is presumed that many cases remain undetected, as visualization of the hepatic vasculature is not part of the routine 20-week sonographic scan in pregnancy. However, portosystemic anastomoses are associated with fetal growth restriction due to a diminished oxygen supply to hepatocytes and, hence, downregulation of liver function. In these cases, uteroplacental perfusion might be normal.
