{"id":66333,"title":"Prognostic and predictive value of plasma testosterone levels in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.","abstract":"Biomarkers for metastatic castration-resistant prostatic cancer (mCRPC) are an unmet medical need.The prognostic and predictive value for survival and response to salvage hormonal therapy (SHT) of baseline testosterone level (TL) was analysed in a cohort of 101 mCRPC patients participating in 9 non-hormonal first-line chemotherapy phase II-III trials. Inclusion criteria in all trials required a TL of <50?ng?dl(-1).Median age: 70 years; visceral metastases: 19.8%; median prostate-specific antigen (PSA): 50.7?ng?ml(-1); median TL: 11.5?ng?dl(-1). Median overall survival (OS; 24.5 months) was significantly longer if baseline TL was above (High TL; n=52) than under (Low TL; n=49) the TL median value (32.7 vs 22.4 months, respectively; P=0.0162, hazard ratio (HR)=0.6). The presence of anaemia was an unfavourable prognostic factor (median OS: 20.6 vs 28.4 months; P=0.0025, HR=1.88 (CI95%: 1.01-3.48)). Patients presenting both anaemia and low testosterone had a worse outcome compared to those with one or none of them (median OS: 17.9 vs 22.4 vs 38.1 months; P=0.0024). High vs Low TL was associated with PSA response rate (55.6% vs 21.7%) in 41 patients receiving SHT.Testosterone level under castration range was a prognostic factor for survival mCRPC patients. The PSA response to SHT differed depending on TLs. Testosterone levels might help in treatment decision.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722180","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Hormonal therapy (oncology)","weight":0.759089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_therapy_(oncology)"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.582679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.545769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.533709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.449517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Shit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Real estate pricing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_pricing"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Fish measurement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_measurement"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Uncial 0162","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0162"}]}
