{"id":83056,"title":"The association between periodontal disease and seizure severity in refractory epilepsy patients.","abstract":"Periodontal diseases are common in most populations and affect people at all socioeconomic levels. Evidence suggests that patients with epilepsy actually have higher risks of dental disease and increased oral health needs, but the frequency and consequences of poor controlled seizures on dental and periodontal health have not been reported before. We aimed to assess the impact of seizure frequency on periodontal status and oral hygiene in a sample of epilepsy patients.One hundred and nine consecutive patients treated for epilepsy at the outpatient clinic of our University Hospital were invited to take part in an oral examination to determine their periodontal disease status, together with a control group. In addition, seizure frequency and use of medication were documented.In logistic regression model, patients were significantly more susceptible to bad oral hygiene, gingivitis and periodontitis that controls (p<0.001); seizure frequency was significantly related to bad oral hygiene (p=0.010), gingivitis (p<0.001) and periodontitis (p<0.001). Tooth brushing habits and presence of caries were associated with oral health in patients group.Our study found a significant positive correlation between periodontal disease and seizure severity. Epilepsy patients need to focus more on their oral health and quality of oral hygiene.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456623","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.709923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.628469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.578215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.511303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.322769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.295345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Dental disease","weight":0.178952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_disease"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.17374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Caries","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tooth brushing","weight":0.0381836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
