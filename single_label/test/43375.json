{"id":43375,"title":"Romanian national guidelines and practical recommendations on liver elastography.","abstract":"The use of liver elastography has substantially developed in the past few years; the introduction of novel elastographic methods (Transient Elastography, point Shear Wave Elastography, Real Time Shear Wave Elastography, Strain Elastography) has changed the perspective in the evaluation of liver disease. The ongoing research in this area is mainly focused on diffuse liver diseases and for predicting liver cirrhosis complication. This guideline created under the auspice of Romanian Society of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology is intended to accustomize the clinician with the current practical use of liver elastography and has been issued to help in maximizing the clinical benefit for the patients with chronic liver diseases.
