{"id":89075,"title":"Use of lean principals to improve flow of patients with fractured neck of femur--the HOPE study.","abstract":"We describe the implementation of a care pathway for patients with fractured neck of femur (NOF) using Lean and Six Sigma principles. After introduction of the Lean pathway, 32 patients out a total of 86 (37%) with fractured NOF were admitted to the Trauma Ward within 4 hours of presentation to the hospital; prior to implementation this was 16 patients out of a total of 59 (27%). Post-Lean an earlier mean theatre start time of 8.40am was achieved, resulting in a 38 minute increase in daily theatre time. An additional 52 patients (12%) received surgery within 24 hours of admission, resulting in 1 night length of stay reduction. Lean methodology proved an effective method to guide change resulting in an improved journey for the patient and significant workflow gains.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757887","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Six Sigma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Hackers on Planet Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_on_Planet_Earth"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"National Liberation Front (Macedonia)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Macedonia)"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"}]}
