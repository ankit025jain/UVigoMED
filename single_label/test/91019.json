{"id":91019,"title":"Popliteal artery injury associated with total knee arthroplasty: trends, costs and risk factors.","abstract":"Popliteal artery injury is a relatively rare but potentially devastating complication of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2009 to determine the actual incidence, risk factors and consequences of this complication. There were 1,120,508 hospitalizations coded for TKA; of these, 633 (0.057%) were identified as having a popliteal artery injury. The rate of injury remained relatively constant though the number of both TKAs and injuries have risen annually by 0.65% and 0.5%, respectively. Significant risk factors included revision surgery, peripheral vascular disease, weight loss, renal failure, coagulopathy, and metastatic cancer. Consequences were increased hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality rates. Because the rate of popliteal artery injury is not diminishing with time and morbidity and mortality are high, patients should be assessed for known risk factors for popliteal artery injury.
