{"id":12256,"title":"The effect of copper on vasospastic femoral artery in rats.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of copper, which is the cofactor and regulator of the superoxide dysmutase enzyme, on preventing experimental peripheral vasospasm in rats through antioxidative mechanisms.Twenty-four female Wistar-Albino rats were divided into 3 groups: group 1 (n=8), control group; group 2 (n=8), vasospasm group; and group 3 (n=8), vasospasm + copper treatment group. Morphometric measurements of wall thickness and lumen diameter of femoral arteries were performed.Statistical comparison of groups 1 and 2, regarding thickness of vascular walls, revealed a significant increase in group 2 (p=0.037) and regarding lumen diameters, revealed a significant decrease in group 2 (p=0.043). Comparison of diameters of the vascular lumen of groups 1 and 3 showed no significant difference (p=0.19), whereas the comparison of the thicknesses of the vascular walls displayed a significant increase in group 3 (p=0.028). Comparison of groups 2 and 3 regarding diameter of vascular lumens showed a significant decrease in group 2 (p=0.042), whereas group 3 displayed a significant decrease, in terms of thickness of the vascular walls (p=0.029).This study showed quantitatively that copper could prevent the development of experimental peripheral vasospasm in rats.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535787","annotations":[{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.708119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.680616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.677683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.450154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Vasospasm","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasospasm"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"}]}
