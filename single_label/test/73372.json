{"id":73372,"title":"Examination of national lymph node evaluation practices for adult extremity soft tissue sarcoma.","abstract":"Lymph node evaluation recommendations for extremity soft tissue sarcoma (ESTS) are absent from national guidelines. Our objectives were (1) to assess rates and predictors of nodal evaluation, and (2) to assess rates and predictors of nodal metastases.ESTS patients from the National Cancer Data Base (2000-2009) were assessed, and regression models were used to identify factors associated with nodal evaluation and metastases.Of 27,536 ESTS patients, 1,924 (7%) underwent nodal evaluation, and of these, 290 (15%) had nodal metastases. Nodal evaluation was most frequently performed for rhabdomyosarcoma (15.6%), angiosarcoma (10.0%), clear cell sarcoma (39.3%), epithelioid sarcoma (28.1%), and synovial sarcoma (9.3%). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with nodal evaluation included histologic subtype, tumor size, and grade. Nodal metastasis rates were highest among patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (32.1%), angiosarcoma (24.1%), clear cell sarcoma (27.7%), and epithelioid sarcoma (31.8%). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with nodal metastases included histologic subtype, tumor size, and grade.Nodal evaluation rates are highest among certain expected subtypes but are generally low. However, nodal metastasis rates for many histologic subtypes in patients selected for lymph node evaluation may be higher than previously reported. Multi-institutional studies should address nodal evaluation for ESTS.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910401","annotations":[{"name":"Synovial sarcoma","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_sarcoma"},{"name":"Soft-tissue sarcoma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-tissue_sarcoma"},{"name":"Rhabdomyosarcoma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyosarcoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Angiosarcoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiosarcoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clear-cell sarcoma","weight":0.841184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear-cell_sarcoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Epithelioid sarcoma","weight":0.820698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelioid_sarcoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.704481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.600615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"536","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/536"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"924","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/924"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"NODAL","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NODAL"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
