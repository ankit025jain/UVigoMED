{"id":7741,"title":"Comparison of the degree of autophagy in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation.","abstract":"Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) is an important in vitro model for exploring the molecular mechanisms and functions of autophagy during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) and H9c2 cells are widely used to study H/R.The degree of autophagy in NRCM and H9c2 cells exposed to H/R was assessed by detecting the markers of autophagy, Beclin-1 and LC3II. Autophagosomes were confirmed in both NRCM and H9c2 cells exposed to H/R using MDC staining and TEM.The expression levels of Beclin-1 and LC3II were significantly increased in NRCM under H/R conditions (p < 0.05 vs. control). In contrast, the expression levels of Beclin-1 and LC3II were significantly reduced in H9c2 cells exposed to H/R (p < 0.05 vs. control). The fluorescence intensity and the number of MDC-labeled particles were greater in NRCM exposed to H/R, compared to H9c2 cells (p < 0.05 vs. control). The number of autophagosomes exposed to H/R by TEM was greater in NRCM, compared to H9c2 cells, which was similar to the levels of autophagy markers observed in NRCM and H9c2 cells (p < 0.05 vs. control).NRCM may be more suitable to study autophagy during H/R than H9c2 cells.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839824","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.696202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.574226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.543759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.304044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.121183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"LC-3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3"},{"name":"MDC (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDC_(band)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
