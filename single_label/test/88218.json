{"id":88218,"title":"An educational video to promote multi-factorial approaches for fall and injury prevention in long-term care facilities.","abstract":"Older adults living in long term care (LTC) settings are vulnerable to fall-related injuries. There is a need to develop and implement evidence-based approaches to address fall injury prevention in LTC. Knowledge translation (KT) interventions to support the uptake of evidence-based approaches to fall injury prevention in LTC need to be responsive to the learning needs of LTC staff and use mediums, such as videos, that are accessible and easy-to-use. This article describes the development of two unique educational videos to promote fall injury prevention in long-term care (LTC) settings. These videos are unique from other fall prevention videos in that they include video footage of real life falls captured in the LTC setting.Two educational videos were developed (2012-2013) to support the uptake of findings from a study exploring the causes of falls based on video footage captured in LTC facilities. The videos were developed by: (1) conducting learning needs assessment in LTC settings via six focus groups (2) liaising with LTC settings to identify learning priorities through unstructured conversations; and (3) aligning the content with principles of adult learning theory.The videos included footage of falls, interviews with older adults and fall injury prevention experts. The videos present evidence-based fall injury prevention recommendations aligned to the needs of LTC staff and: (1) highlight recommendations deemed by LTC staff as most urgent (learner-centered learning); (2) highlight negative impacts of falls on older adults (encourage meaning-making); and, (3) prompt LTC staff to reflect on fall injury prevention practices (encourage critical reflection).Educational videos are an important tool available to researchers seeking to translate evidence-based recommendations into LTC settings. Additional research is needed to determine their impact on practice.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884899","annotations":[{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Adult education","weight":0.307409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_education"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mediumship","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Order of the Thistle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Thistle"},{"name":"Learning theory (education)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_theory_(education)"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Videotape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape"},{"name":"Lieutenant Colonel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel"},{"name":"Human self-reflection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_self-reflection"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Footage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footage"},{"name":"Long-term care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_care"},{"name":"Aquaculture of salmon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_of_salmon"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Real life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life"},{"name":"Introspection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection"},{"name":"Unstructured data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data"},{"name":"Needs assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needs_assessment"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"}]}
