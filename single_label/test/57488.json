{"id":57488,"title":"Serum levels of androgens and prostate-specific antigen in endometriosis.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of serum androgens and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients with endometriosis.Patients with Stage III/IV (advanced stage) endometriosis were compared to controls with respect to basal serum levels of total testosterone (T), free testosterone (fT), androstenedion (A), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), and PSA in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle for this prospective case control study.Level of T, fT, A, DHEA, and DHEA-S were higher in patients with endometriosis when compared to control subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant. The mean PSA level was 0.0074 +/- 0.0120 ng/ml in patients with endometriosis and 0.0059 +/- 0.0056 ng/ml in control group and there was no statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.58).Serum basal androgens and PSA levels are higher in endometriosis group with respect to control but the differences are not statistically significant.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134292","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Dehydroepiandrosterone","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.822937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.283898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate","weight":0.117676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone_sulfate"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Follicular phase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_phase"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Uncial 0120","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0120"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.0119069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"}]}
