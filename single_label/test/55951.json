{"id":55951,"title":"Foam sclerotherapy for periorbital dermoid cysts.","abstract":"To report nonsurgical treatment of periorbital dermoid cysts with foam sclerotherapy using sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS).Single-center, retrospective, interventional case series. Clinical records of all patients diagnosed to have congenital orbital dermoid cyst and treated with STS foam sclerotherapy between 2012 and 2013 were reviewed. The ectodermal contents of the dermoid cyst were aspirated through a stab incision with 18G needle, followed by saline lavage. Intraluminal foam sclerotherapy was then performed using STS (30 mg/ml) in a proportion of 10% of the total aspirate volume. Retrospective data analysis included demographic profile, clinicoradiologic findings, and treatment outcomes of foam sclerotherapy.Four patients were treated in the given period. Average age at presentation was 20.2 years. All cysts were reported to be congenital in nature, and the location was medial angular in 2 cases, lateral angular in 1 case, and lateral orbitotemporal in 1 case. The average aspirate of the pultaceous cyst content was 3.75 ml (range, 2-5 ml). Of the 4 patients, 2 dermoid cysts resolved completely within 8 weeks. Two cysts showed partial response and required a second foam sclerotherapy to achieve complete resolution. At an average follow up of 13.25 months (range, 11-16 months), complete cyst resolution was noted. No sclerotherapy-related complications were observed.Foam sclerotherapy is successful in obliterating periorbital dermoid cysts and provides a minimally invasive nonsurgical approach to achieve an aesthetic result.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777265","annotations":[{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.313444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.304683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.103138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Dermoid cyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermoid_cyst"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Sodium tetradecyl sulfate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_tetradecyl_sulfate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Aspirated consonant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant"},{"name":"Space Shuttle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle"},{"name":"1116","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1116"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Stabbing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabbing"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Foam","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"},{"name":"Ectoderm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
