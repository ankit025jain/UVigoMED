{"id":28550,"title":"[Comparative study on effects between electroacupuncture and auricular acupuncture for methamphetamine withdrawal syndrome].","abstract":"To observe the efficacy difference of electroacupuncture and auricular acupuncture in the treatment of methamphetamine withdrawal syndrome.Ninety male patients of methamphetamine addiction were randomized into an electroacupuncture group, an auricular acupuncture group and a control group, 30 cases in each one. In the electroacupuncture group, Neiguan (PC 6), Shenmen (HT 7), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Jiaji (EX-B 2) at T5 and L2 were selected bilaterally. In the auricular acupuncture group, jiaogan (AH(6a)), shenmen (TF4), fei (CO14) and gan (CO12) were selected unilaterally. The treatment was given 3 times a week, totally 12 treatments were required. In the control group, no any intervention was applied. Separately, before treatment and after 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks treatment, the scores of methamphetamine withdrawal syndrome, Hamilton anxiety scale and Hamilton depression scale were observed in each group.The total score of methamphetamine withdrawal syndrome, anxiety score and depression score were obviously reduced in 2, 3 and 4 weeks of treatment as compared with those before treatment in the electroacupuncture group and the auricular acupuncture group (all P < 0.05), and showed a trend of gradual decline as the extension of treatment. In 1,2,3,4 weeks of treatment, the total score of withdrawal syndrome, anxiety score and depression score in the electroacupuncture group and auricular acupuncture group were lower significantly than those in the control group (all P < 0.05), in which, the total score of withdrawal syndrome in the electroacupuncture group was lower significantly than that in the auricular acupuncture group in the 4th week of treatment (3.69 +/- 2.446 vs 5.73 +/- 3.169, P < 0.05); the anxiety scores were lower significantly than those in the auricular acupuncture group in 3 and 4 weeks of treatment (8.19 +/- 4.57 vs 9.65 +/- 4.24, 5.27 +/- 2.89 vs 7.38 +/- 3.10, both P < 0.05); the depression scores were lower significantly than those in the auricular acupuncture group in 2, 3 and 4 weeks of treatment (15.35 +/- 5.64 vs 19.81 +/- 5.37, 10.96 +/- 4.52 vs 15.00 +/- 4.53, 7.96 +/- 2.69 vs 12.35 +/- 3.59, all P < 0.05).Electroacupuncture at the body points and auricular acupuncture play the therapeutic role in the treatment of methamphetamine withdrawal syndrome, anxiety and depression. The longer time the treatment is with electroacupuncture at the body points, the more obvious the efficacy will be on the above symptoms.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843957","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.811588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.717121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.664111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.573002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Rating_Scale_for_Depression"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.100779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"AH6","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH6"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Islamic calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"446","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/446"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Fluorescent lamp","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"The Jeevas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jeevas"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"}]}
