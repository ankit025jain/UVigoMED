{"id":91841,"title":"Failure of a constrained acetabular liner without reinforcement ring disruption.","abstract":"Several risk factors for dislocation after total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been identified including operative-, patient-, and implant-related factors. The following case report describes the dislocation of a revision THA without disruption of the constrained liner or containment ring. The possible mechanisms leading to this type of failure include lever-out impingement and poor abductor function, or tension secondary to prior surgery. Dislocation without disruption of containment ring has not been described for the Pinnacle Acetabular Cup with the Enhanced Stability Constrained Liner (DePuy Orthopaedics, Warsaw, Indiana).","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471147","annotations":[{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.644955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.385304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.235355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0568689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Warsaw, Indiana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw,_Indiana"},{"name":"Warsaw","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Containment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment"},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Undescribed taxon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undescribed_taxon"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Ocean liner","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_liner"},{"name":"DePuy","weight":0.0107573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DePuy"}]}
