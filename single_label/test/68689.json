{"id":68689,"title":"Quantitative immunoPET of prostate cancer xenografts with 89Zr- and 124I-labeled anti-PSCA A11 minibody.","abstract":"Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is expressed on the cell surface in 83%-100% of local prostate cancers and 87%-100% of prostate cancer bone metastases. In this study, we sought to develop immunoPET agents using (124)I- and (89)Zr-labeled anti-PSCA A11 minibodies (scFv-CH3 dimer, 80 kDa) and evaluate their use for quantitative immunoPET imaging of prostate cancer.A11 anti-PSCA minibody was alternatively labeled with (124)I- or (89)Zr-desferrioxamine and injected into mice bearing either matched 22Rv1 and 22Rv1×PSCA or LAPC-9 xenografts. Small-animal PET data were obtained and quantitated with and without recovery coefficient-based partial-volume correction, and the results were compared with ex vivo biodistribution.Rapid and specific localization to PSCA-positive tumors and high-contrast imaging were observed with both (124)I- and (89)Zr-labeled A11 anti-PSCA minibody. However, the differences in tumor uptake and background uptake of the radiotracers resulted in different levels of imaging contrast. The nonresidualizing (124)I-labeled minibody had lower tumor uptake (3.62 ± 1.18 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g] 22Rv1×PSCA, 3.63 ± 0.59 %ID/g LAPC-9) than the residualizing (89)Zr-labeled minibody (7.87 ± 0.52 %ID/g 22Rv1×PSCA, 9.33 ± 0.87 %ID/g LAPC-9, P < 0.0001 for each), but the (124)I-labeled minibody achieved higher imaging contrast because of lower nonspecific uptake and better tumor-to-soft-tissue ratios (22Rv1×PSCA:22Rv1 positive-to-negative tumor, 13.31 ± 5.59 (124)I-A11 and 4.87 ± 0.52 (89)Zr-A11, P = 0.02). Partial-volume correction was found to greatly improve the correspondence between small-animal PET and ex vivo quantification of tumor uptake for immunoPET imaging with both radionuclides.Both (124)I- and (89)Zr-labeled A11 anti-PSCA minibody showed high-contrast imaging of PSCA expression in vivo. However, the (124)I-labeled A11 minibody was found to be the superior imaging agent because of lower nonspecific uptake and higher tumor-to-soft-tissue contrast. Partial-volume correction was found to be essential for robust quantification of immunoPET imaging with both (124)I- and (89)Zr-labeled A11 minibody.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504052","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.782963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.593047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.583018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.440396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.288404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Biodistribution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodistribution"},{"name":"Imaging agent","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_agent"},{"name":"Zirconium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirconium"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
