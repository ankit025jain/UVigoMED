{"id":59129,"title":"[Uterine fibroids].","abstract":"The uterine fibroid is a benign tumour. The prevalence, in all the population, is 50% for european women and 80% for black women. 30% of fibroids are symptomatic. The new FIGO classification gives 7 positions (0 to 7), submuccus (0, 1, 2), interstitial (3, 4, 5), subserous (6, 7). Diagnosis is performed by 2D and 3D ultrasound which could be associated by hysterosonography. Hysteroscopy and MRI could be proposed. Hysterectomy is the main treatment, if possible by vaginal or laparoscopic way. Conservative treatment (myomectomy) could be realized by hysteroscopic, laparoscopic way or laparotomy for patients who desire to preserve fertility. Arteries embolisation is an alternative to hysterectomy or myomectomy for patients without desire of pregnancy. Preoperative treatments by GnRH agonist or SPRM like ulipristal acetate treat anaemia, decrease the myoma volume and could modify the therapeutic strategy.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855792","annotations":[{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Hysteroscopy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteroscopy"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.843084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics"},{"name":"Fibroma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroma"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.772858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.628396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.562623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Selective progesterone receptor modulator","weight":0.417227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_progesterone_receptor_modulator"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.367548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Uterine myomectomy","weight":0.341701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_myomectomy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"3D ultrasound","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_ultrasound"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
