{"id":80873,"title":"[Contribution of Leishmania identification using polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymerase for epidemiological studies of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Tunisia].","abstract":"Three forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are endemic in Tunisia. The identification of the causative species is useful to complete epidemiological data and to manage the cases. The aim of this study is to assess PCR-RFLP technique in the identification of Leishmania species responsible of CL in Tunisia and to compare the results of this technique to those of isoenzyme analysis.Sixty-one CL lesions were sampled. Dermal samples were tested by culture on NNN medium and analyzed by PCR-RFLP assay targeting the ITS1 region of ribosomal DNA. Species identification was performed by both iso-enzymatic typing for positive cultures and analysis of restriction profiles after enzymatic digestion by HaeIII of the obtained amplicons.Thirty-eight (62%) samples were positive by culture. The iso-enzymatic typing of 32 isolates identified 3 L. infantum, 23 L. major MON-25 and 6 L. tropica MON-8. Sixty samples were positive by PCR. The PCR-RFLP digestion profiles of the 56 PCR products identified 12 L. infantum, 38 L. major and 6 L. tropica. The results of both techniques were concordant in the 32 strains identified by both techniques. Species identification correlated with the geographical distribution of CL forms endemic in Tunisia.Results of PCR-RFLP revealed highly concordant with those of isoenzyme electrophoresis. Thanks to its simplicity, rapidity and ability to be performed directly on biological samples, this technique appears as an interesting alternative for the identification of Leishmania strains responsible of CL in Tunisia.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Parasitic
