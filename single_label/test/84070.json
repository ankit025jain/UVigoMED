{"id":84070,"title":"Intravenous use of tranexamic acid reduces postoperative blood loss in total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"Blood transfusion is often required in total knee replacement (TKR); several methods of blood preservation are commonly used but the ideal solution is to reduce the blood loss during and after surgery. Aim of the study was to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy and safety of intravenous use of tranexamic acid in patients receiving TKR (cemented).Forty-five patients after TKR receive treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA, treatment group), and 45 were managed with fibrin tissue adhesive (control group). Hemoglobin values decrease and transfusions in both groups were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with Student t test and ? (2) test. A statistical model was elaborated to evaluate together all variables and to underline what data can increase transfusions need.A significant reduction was detected in hemoglobin values in the first 3Â days after surgery in the treatment group. The difference in all cases was significant. When tranexamic acid was administered, the need for transfusions was lower (difference statistically significant). No major adverse events were recorded in our series. The use of autologous blood preparation before surgery led to a higher transfusion rate.Tranexamic acid reduced blood loss in TKR and significantly reduced the blood transfusion need also when compared to fibrin tissue adhesive. The use of tranexamic acid is safe and in future may avoid preparation of autologous blood unit before surgery with a decrease of cost and medical figures involved.","date":"2014-10-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25179896","annotations":[{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.870749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Blood bank","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_bank"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.643183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.57268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.465028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.463219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.458909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.354898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Tranexamic acid","weight":0.273049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranexamic_acid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
