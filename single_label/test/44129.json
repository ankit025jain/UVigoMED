{"id":44129,"title":"Short-type and conventional single-balloon enteroscopes for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with surgically altered anatomy: single-center experience.","abstract":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is technically challenging in patients with Roux-en-Y anastomosis and Billroth-II anastomosis. Short-type single-balloon enteroscope (SBE) was developed to carry out ERCP in postoperative patients with a reconstructed intestine. It is useful because of its good rotational and straightening ability and the availability of various conventional ERCP accessories through the 3.2-mm working channel, and it has a water-jet channel.In the present study, we compared outcomes between groups with short-type SBE and conventional SBE.With regard to reaching the blind end, mean time to reach the blind end, diagnostic success rate, therapeutic success rate, mean procedure time, and complication rate, there were no statistical differences between the two groups.The results suggest that both types of SBE are equally useful for ERCP in patients with a reconstructed intestine. Short-type SBE may be more preferable because of its good specification and maneuverability.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750167","annotations":[{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.795251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.621141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.22131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.20122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Hair straightening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_straightening"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Pump-jet","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump-jet"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Fashion accessory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_accessory"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0106373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
