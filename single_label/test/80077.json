{"id":80077,"title":"[IL-10 level in allergic rats infected by Echinococcus granulosus].","abstract":"Forty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups with 10 in each group. Group A served as normal control. The other 3 groups were injected intraperitoneally with Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces 5 x 10(4) each. Six months later, group D was injected intraperitoneally with antibody against IL-10 2.0 microg/time, twice a day for 2 d. Two days later, rats in groups C and D were injected intraperitoneally with cyst fluid 5 ml each to induce allergic reaction. 30 min later, all the rats were sacrificed to observe the infection status and obtain peripheral blood. The level of IL-10, IgE and histamine in the sera was detected by ELISA. The results showed that 5, 6 and 5 rats in groups B, C and D were infected successfully, respectively, with 2 deaths in group A. The rats in groups C and D appeared nasal itching, sneezing and declined activity. 30 min later, the symptoms in group C got improved, but not for group D. The levels of IL-10 and IgE in groups C and D increased significantly compared to group B (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-10 and IgE in group D were (142.61 +/- 43.58) pg/ml and (20.67 +/- 1.58) microg/ml, respectively, lower than those in group C (P < 0.05). The level of histamine was (17.69 +/- 3.90) ng/ml, higher than that in groups B and C (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in histamine level between B and C (P > 0.05).","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809184","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.77432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.666864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.650443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.534715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.458909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Echinococcus granulosus","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_granulosus"},{"name":"Sneeze","weight":0.293263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.267296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0485303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
