{"id":43577,"title":"Robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy: the Ivor Lewis approach.","abstract":"Robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) is emerging as a potential alternative approach to standard minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). However, early reports vary widely in operative approach, method, and reporting of outcomes, including operative complications. A formal, prospective academic program to evaluate RAMIE was initiated at the authors' institution, with the primary goal of maximizing patient safety during the introduction of new technology into the operating room. The standardized RAMIE Ivor Lewis approach developed through this program is described in detail. The available literature is reviewed, with early reports suggesting outcomes similar to those of MIE and standard open esophagectomy.
