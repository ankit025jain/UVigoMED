{"id":85526,"title":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection: chest CT findings.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to describe the chest CT findings in seven patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.The most common CT finding in hospitalized patients with MERS-CoV infection is that of bilateral predominantly subpleural and basilar airspace changes, with more extensive ground-glass opacities than consolidation. The subpleural and peribronchovascular predilection of the abnormalities is suggestive of an organizing pneumonia pattern.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918624","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.647415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.507266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.441017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.399151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.328894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.210311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Airspace","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Basilar artery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilar_artery"},{"name":"Pulmonary consolidation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_consolidation"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiolitis_obliterans_organizing_pneumonia"}]}
