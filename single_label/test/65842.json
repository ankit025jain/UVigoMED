{"id":65842,"title":"Evaluation of selected risk factors of cardiovascular diseases among patients after kidney transplantation, with particular focus on the role of 24-hour automatic blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis of hypertension: an introductory report.","abstract":"Arterial hypertension is a donor-related and modifiable risk factor in a graft dysfunction. The aim of the study was to perform a multi-factor analysis describing the relations between arterial hypertension and clinical parameters of a graft recipient.Fifty patients 3 months after a kidney transplant took part in the study. The following research tools were used: (1) 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring, ABPM; (2) traditional method - office BP; (3) the authors' questionnaire form, (4) Morisky-Green test for self-evaluation of the compliance level; (5) disease history. The relevance level was p<0.05.ABPM results showed that only 8 (16%) renal transplant recipients are normotensive without any antihypertensive drugs. It was shown through ABPM that insufficient controlling of hypertension was observed in 22 patients (44%). It was shown that 9 patients (18%) had masked hypertension and 5 patients (10%) white-coat hypertension. Eight patients (16%) showed controlled daily rhythm of blood pressure (\"dippers\"). No statistically significant correlation between ABPM and office BP and creatinine level was observed.The results of the study show insufficient control of arterial hypertension and the occurrence of masked hypertension and the white-coat effect in patients after KTx. ABPM should be routinely performed in post-KTx patients. Nonadherence to regular taking of medication and improper lifestyle of patients in the third month after KTx are not a risk factor in higher values of arterial hypertension and higher level of creatinine.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770703","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.823548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.432493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.303258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure measurement","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
