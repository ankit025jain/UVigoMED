{"id":84058,"title":"The immunobiology of cobalt: demonstration of a potential aetiology for inflammatory pseudotumours after metal-on-metal replacement of the hip.","abstract":"Abnormal wear of cobalt-containing metal-on-metal joints is associated with inflammatory pseudotumours. Cobalt ions activate human toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which normally responds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in sepsis. Activation of TLR4 by LPS increases the expression of chemokines IL-8 and CXCL10, which recruit leukocytes and activated T-cells, respectively. This study was designed to determine whether cobalt induces a similar inflammatory response to LPS by promoting the expression of IL-8 and CXCL10. A human monocytic cell line, derived from acute monocytic leukaemia, was treated with cobalt ions and expression of IL-8 and CXCL10 measured at mRNA and protein levels. Cobalt-treated macrophages showed a 60-fold increase in IL-8 mRNA, and an eightfold increase in production of the mature chemokine (both p < 0.001); expression of the CXCL10 gene and protein was also significantly increased by cobalt (both p < 0.001). Experiments were also performed in the presence of CLI-095, a TLR4-specific antagonist which abrogated the cobalt-mediated increase in IL-8 and CXCL10 expression. These findings suggest that cobalt ions induce inflammation similar to that observed during sepsis by the simultaneous activation of two TLR4-mediated signalling pathways. These pathways result in increased production of IL-8 and CXCL10, and may be implicated in pseudotumour formation following metal-on-metal replacement.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183586","annotations":[{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.850057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.823166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"TLR 4","weight":0.673055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_4"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.620865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.575014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Cobalt","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.523188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.509539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"CXCL10","weight":0.360221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL10"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"}]}
