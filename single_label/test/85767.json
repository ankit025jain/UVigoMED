{"id":85767,"title":"Antiviral resistance in influenza viruses: laboratory testing.","abstract":"Influenza continues to be a significant health care issue. Although vaccination is the major line of defense, antiviral drugs play an important role in prophylaxis and disease management. Approved drugs for influenza are currently limited to those that target the viral matrix protein or neuraminidase enzyme. Resistance-associated sequence changes in the genes encoding these proteins have been extensively studied. Available methods for genotypic and phenotypic antiviral susceptibility testing have expanded and are being further developed and improved. The sporadic emergence of drug-resistant variants and the global spread of resistant strains have demonstrated the ongoing need for vigilant testing and surveillance.
