{"id":59284,"title":"Development and validation of a new HPV genotyping assay based on next-generation sequencing.","abstract":"We developed a new human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping assay based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods for large-scale cervical cancer screening.We first trained the assay on 1,170 self-collected samples, balancing the cutoff points for high-risk types. Then using 4,262 separate self-collected specimens, we compared concordance, sensitivity, and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 2 (CIN2) or higher and CIN type 3 (CIN3) or higher of the HPV sequencing assay with that of Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) direct samples and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay self-samples.All assays had a good agreement. The sensitivity for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher of the self-sampling specimens tested with the sequencing assay run on both MiSeq and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine sequencer was similar to that of direct-sampling specimens tested with HC2 (P > .05), but the specificity of the sequencing assay for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher was significantly higher than that of HC2 (P < .01).This population-based study has demonstrated the applicability of a new NGS high-risk HPV assay for primary cervical cancer screening based on self-collection.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838323","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.920421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.50408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia","weight":0.389423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_intraepithelial_neoplasia"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.328393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.194327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.145686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.114522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0822246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Music sequencer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer"},{"name":"National Geographic Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type three secretion system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_three_secretion_system"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
