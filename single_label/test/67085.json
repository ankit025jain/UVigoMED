{"id":67085,"title":"[Application of methods of angiosurgery for the treatment of venogenic erectile dysfunction].","abstract":"The article presents the results of the use of alternative method of treatment--endovascular occlusion of the prostatic plexus--in patients with isolated venogenic erectile dysfunction. The IIEF-5 and AMS questionnaires were used for the evaluation of results of the operation. Improvement of quality of erection in the first 3 months after surgery was achieved in the majority of patients. The use of this innovative technology provides secure, minimally invasive and pathogenetically justified treatment of ED caused by abnormal venous drainage from the cavernous bodies.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649763","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.724962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.501956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.342869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Sexological testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexological_testing"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.0211494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Cavernous sinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"American Meteorological Society","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Meteorological_Society"}]}
