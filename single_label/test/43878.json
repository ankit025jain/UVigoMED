{"id":43878,"title":"Application of genomic principles to pharmacotherapy of cancer.","abstract":"To teach first-year (P1) pharmacy students to apply the principles of pharmacogenomics underlying clinical pharmacotherapeutics to cancer patients.Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high-resolution melting analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from colorectal cancer cell lines to determine the presence of somatic mutations for an oncogenic marker, students formulated the proper course of treatment for a patient with similar tumor genomics.In a postintervention survey, students highly rated the effectiveness of the laboratory session for learning pharmacogenomics, and subsequent examination scores reflected retention of principles and understanding of clinical application.The pharmacogenomic laboratory exercise prepared students to understand how genetic markers give clinical insight into the appropriate application of drugs in oncology pharmacotherapy. Further, the session inspired their interest in learning more about pharmacogenomics and their professional roles in personalized medicine.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761016","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Pharmacogenomics","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.566785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.560249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.504448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.476351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.459971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.323039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.224409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
