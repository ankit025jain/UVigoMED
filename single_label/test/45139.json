{"id":45139,"title":"Comparison of faecal M2-PK and FIT in a population-based bowel cancer screening cohort.","abstract":"Screening for colorectal cancer improves outcomes and is cost effective. Stool-based tests have the highest participation rates in screening programmes. Their efficacy is limited by the relatively low sensitivity and specificity compared with colonoscopy. Stool levels of M2-PK, a dimeric form of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, correlate with colorectal cancer and neoplasia. A combination of stool markers may enhance screening performance; however, it remains to be determined whether an additional test would affect participation rates negatively.The aim of this study was to assess the performance of faecal M2-PK and faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and their combined effect in a screening programme.Within round 2 of our biennial FIT-based pilot, all invitations additionally included an M2-PK kit. A FIT greater than 100 ngHb/ml and/or an M2-PK greater than 4 U/ml were considered positive. FIT-positive or M2-PK-positive patients were offered a colonoscopy.In all, 1800 combined M2-PK and FIT invites were sent out, and 879 (49%) samples were analysed. Overall positivity was 27% (n=245). Only 23 (2.6%) patients were positive for both tests. In all, 186 (88%) screening colonoscopies were performed. The adenoma detection rate for M2-PK-positive patients (n=157) was significant at 25% (n=40), and 3% (n=5) had advanced lesions. In FIT-positive patients (n=51), the adenoma detection rate was 29% (n=15), with significantly more, 21% (n=11), having advanced lesions (P<0.001, confidence interval 0.117-0.156). Had FIT only been tested, 70% (n=35) fewer patients would have had polyps removed.The addition of M2-PK in a biennial bowel screening programme is acceptable to patients, feasible and detects additional adenomas, potentially at an earlier stage.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699725","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.761851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.711368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.665608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.50931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.42225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.403126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pyruvic acid","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.359808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.234615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Pyruvate kinase","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_kinase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0496898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Money supply","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"1800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800"},{"name":"879","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/879"},{"name":"1170","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1170"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Fashion Institute of Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Institute_of_Technology"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Biennial plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biennial_plant"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Immunoelectrophoresis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoelectrophoresis"}]}
