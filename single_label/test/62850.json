{"id":62850,"title":"A case of nonepisodic angioedema with eosinophilia associated with livedo reticularis and erythema before onset of edema of the legs.","abstract":"The cause of angioedema with eosinophilia (AE) is unknown. Patients with AE sometimes develop pruritic eruptions or urticaria before the onset of edema. We report a case of a 37-year-old woman with nonepisodic AE who presented with erythema and livedo reticularis before the onset of edema. The patient noticed erythema on both heels as well as livedo reticularis on her right great toe 1 month prior to presentation. A biopsy specimen from the heel revealed numerous eosinophils with degranulation infiltrating the subcutaneous tissue. One month later, she developed edema on the legs. Histopathologic findings of biopsy specimens obtained from the legs revealed edema and eosinophils in the subcutaneous tissue. Some patients with AE present with pruritic eruptions prior to the onset of edema. The diagnosis of AE in our patient with leg edema of unknown cause was considered prior to the appearance of any pruritic eruptions.
