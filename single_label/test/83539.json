{"id":83539,"title":"[The role of continuous vacuum sealing drainage in the prevention of lymph leakage after inguinal lymph nodes dissection].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical application of the vacuum-sealing drainage (VSD) in the prevention of lymph leakage after inguinal lymphadenectomy.From September 2003 to September 2013, 60 cases who underwent inguinal lymph nodes dissection received VSD (n = 30), or traditional pressure dressing and drainage( control group, n = 30) after operation. The flap blood supply, healing process and incidence rate of lymph leakage were observed.Twenty-eight cases in VSD group were effective. Eleven cases were cured, ten cases were effective, and nine cases were invalid in control group. The cure rate, effective rate and healing period were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.01).The incidence of lymph leakage after inguinal lymphadenectomy can markedly decrease with VSD application. VSD could be an ideal preventive method for post-operative lymph leakage.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322572","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.521841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.475431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.407955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Inguinal lymph node","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_lymph_node"},{"name":"Vacuum packing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_packing"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
