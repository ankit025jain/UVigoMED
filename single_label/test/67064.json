{"id":67064,"title":"TCTP as therapeutic target in cancers.","abstract":"The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved protein present in eukaryotic organisms. This protein, located both in the cytoplasmic and the nucleus, is expressed in various tissues and is regulated in response to a wide range of extracellular stimuli. TCTP interacts with itself and other protein including MCL1 and p53. TCTP has been shown to play an important role in physiological events, such as cell proliferation, cell death and immune responses but also in stress response and tumor reversion. Moreover, TCTP expression is associated with malignancy and chemoresistance. In this review, we will evaluate pathways regulated by TCTP and current inhibitory strategy to target TCTP in cancerous diseases.
