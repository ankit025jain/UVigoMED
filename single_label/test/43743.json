{"id":43743,"title":"[Case of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with esophageal carcinoma presenting with neurological signs].","abstract":"A 72-year-old male was admitted because of hearing impairment, blurred vision, right hemifacial numbness, and difficulty walking. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed two enhancing lesions with infiltration around the cranial nerves indicating either metastatic brain tumors or meningeal carcinomatosis. Cytological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed malignant cells with keratotic changes. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, which revealed type 1 squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus;this led to the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. In this report, we present a rare case of esophageal carcinoma accompanied by meningeal carcinomatosis diagnosed on the basis of neurological symptoms.
