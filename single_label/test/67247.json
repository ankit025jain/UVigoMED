{"id":67247,"title":"Decrease of the incidence of renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor induced oligohydramnios-sequence in Germany in 2011.","abstract":"to assess whether the incidence of angiotensin II-receptor type 1 antagonist (AT1-antagonist)â€“ or ACE-inhibitor induced cases of oligohydramnios sequence (OHS) in 2011 was reduced after intensive alerts as to the causal association between AT1-antagonist /ACE-inhibitor and OHS in the German medical literature.3 sources of information were used: A nationwide active surveillance of OHS in German paediatric hospitals (ESPED); Embryotox, (Berlin Institute for Clinical Teratology and Drug Risk Assessment in Pregnancy) and screening of pubmed (AT1-antagonist/ACE-inhibitor induced OHS).45 cases of OHS were identified, no case due to maternal AT1-antagonist/ACE-inhibitor treatment. Causes for OHS were: premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (n = 28), congenital anomalies of fetal kidneys and urinary tract(CAKUT (n = 15), placental insufficiency (n = 1),unknown cause (n = 1). Mortality until discharge was 37.8 % (32.1 % PPROM, 57.1 % CAKUT). Embryotox identified 3 exposures to AT1-antagonists in pregnancy, no case was associated with OHS. The pubmed search did not identify any case of OHS related to AT1-antagonist/ACE-inhibitor in pregnancy in Germany in 2011.Treatment of pregnant women with ACE inhibitors or AT1-antagonists still occurs but no cases of AT1-antagonist- or ACE-inhibitor induced OHS were reported in 2011 in Germany most likely due to repeated published alerts underlining the importance of consequent education. OHS remains a serious condition with high mortality despite modern intensive care.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital
