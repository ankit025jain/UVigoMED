{"id":68729,"title":"[Complex investigation and functional evaluation of patients with a solitary kidney and urolithic disease].","abstract":"Complex examination of patients, having solitary kidney and urolithic disease, was conducted. While comparing the calcium accumulation in glomerular and reabsorbed ultrafiltrate and radio-pharmpreparation in a solitary nonaffected kidney, their step by step increase was noted during follow-up to 1 yr after nephrectomy conduction. The static scintigraphy gives possibility to reveal the calcium content rising in glomerular and reabsorbed ultrafiltrate in each kidney separately.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501990","annotations":[{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.442454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.110913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.0617798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Nuclear medicine","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Ultrafiltration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafiltration"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Strowger switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strowger_switch"},{"name":"Reabsorption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reabsorption"},{"name":"Heaviside step function","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Electrostatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"}]}
