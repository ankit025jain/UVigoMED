{"id":63591,"title":"Serum miR-122 levels are related to coagulation disorders in sepsis patients.","abstract":"Coagulation abnormalities may have a major impact on the outcome of sepsis in patients. This study aimed to explore the relationship between miRNA levels and coagulation disorders during sepsis.Blood samples from 123 sepsis patients were collected on the day of admission and another 45 sepsis patients on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 following admission to the intensive care unit. miR-223, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-122, miR-193b*, and miR-483-5p levels were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Based on the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) score, sepsis patients were divided into coagulation abnormal (CA) group and coagulation normal (CN) group.Only the levels of miR-122 were significantly higher in CA patients than in CN patients (p<0.001). Serum levels of miR-122 were correlated to the serum activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratios (R=0.426, p=0.008) and the fibrinogen (FIB; R=0.398, p=0.008) and antithrombin III (R=0.913, p<0.001) levels. In addition, Pearson's correlation coefficients for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with miR-122 were 0.663 (p<0.001) and 0.445 (p=0.001), respectively. In the 45 patients, the miR-122 levels were significantly higher on day 1, 3, 7, and 10 in the CA group than in the CN group, and no difference in the ISTH-DIC scores was evident.Serum levels of miR-122 were correlated to the coagulation disorder in sepsis patients.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
