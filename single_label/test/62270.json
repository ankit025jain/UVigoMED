{"id":62270,"title":"A rim-enhanced mass with central cystic changes on MR imaging: how to distinguish breast cancer from inflammatory breast diseases?","abstract":"To evaluate the capacity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish breast cancer from inflammatory breast diseases manifesting as a rim-enhanced mass with central cystic changes.Forty cases of breast cancer and 52 of inflammatory breast diseases showing a rim-enhanced mass with central cystic changes were retrospectively reviewed. All cases underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and 31 of them underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Morphological features, dynamic parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were comparatively analyzed using univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis.Breast cancer had a significantly thicker wall than the inflammatory breast diseases (P<0.001) while internal enhancing septa were more common in inflammatory breast diseases (P=0.003). On DWI, 86.7% of breast cancers demonstrate a peripheral hyperintensity whereas 93.8% of inflammatory breast diseases had a central hyperintensity (P<0.001). Compared to the inflammatory breast diseases, breast cancers had a lower ADC value for the wall (1.09 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs 1.42 × 10(-3) mm2/s, P<0.001) and a higher ADC value for the central part (1.94 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs 1.05 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P<0.001).Both breast cancer and inflammatory breast diseases could present as a rim-enhanced mass with central cystic changes on MRI. Integrated analysis of the MR findings can allow for an accurate differential diagnosis.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598845","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.812764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.763485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.567506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.436156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.255214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Driving under the influence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Breast disease","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_disease"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Hyperintensity","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperintensity"}]}
