{"id":19031,"title":"Molecular characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from renal transplanted patients: virulence markers, extended-spectrum ?-lactamases, and genetic relatedness.","abstract":"The objective was to characterize virulence markers and ?-lactam resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from renal transplant patients and to evaluate their genetic relatedness. Two main genetic lineages were detected: 1 carried bla(CTX-M-15) not associated to IncFIIA plasmid replicon, which was found on the other lineage not expressing CTX-M-type enzyme. PAI III(536) and PAI II(CFT073) were detected for the first time in K. pneumoniae in 1 clone, while the siderophore kfu was carried by the other, with only PAI IV(536). The molecular data indicate colonization before admission and fuel the discussion on implementation of antibiotherapy before surgery.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746826","annotations":[{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.866808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.480046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.451523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.419817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.373667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.309824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.303706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Siderophore","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siderophore"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Fuel","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"},{"name":"Replicon (genetics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicon_(genetics)"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"536","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/536"},{"name":"Coefficient of relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"},{"name":"Kin selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
