{"id":19427,"title":"The effects of nutritional deficiencies, smoking, and systemic disease on orthopaedic outcomes.","abstract":"Most patients are evaluated by an internist for medical clearance before undergoing an elective orthopaedic procedure. Internists and anesthesiologists evaluate a patient's risk for morbidity or mortality from a procedure, whereas orthopaedic surgeons are often primarily concerned with a patient's risk for a poor outcome. Nutritional and systemic comorbidities can increase the risks for surgical site infections and poor outcomes. Knowing how to handle and identify these issues before surgery can have a substantial effect on improving the likelihood of good outcomes from elective orthopaedic procedures.
