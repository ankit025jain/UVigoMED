{"id":24504,"title":"[Sepsis: a new look at the problem].","abstract":"The recent proceedings of congresses and forums on sepsis were used to write this review. The available definitions of sepsis and ideas on its etiology and pathogenesis are critically analyzed. There is information on new concepts of sepsis and data on a search for new targets, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, and biomarkers. It is hypothesized that there is a mechanism of action of bacteria on mitochondrial dysfunction and human hormonal regulation with low-molecular weight exometabolites, namely aromatic microbial metabolites.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432607","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.80712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.412353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.405234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"United States Congress","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"}]}
