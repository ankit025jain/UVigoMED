{"id":56497,"title":"Evaluation of contrast sensitivity measurements after retrobulbar optic neuritis in Multiple Sclerosis.","abstract":"The evaluation of contrast sensitivity is an important additional examination that allows the physician to achieve the full picture of a patient's quality of vision. In low-contrast conditions, more discrete visual dysfunctions may be revealed, which could be overlooked in high-contrast tests.The examined group consisted of 33 eyes of 27 patients with multiple sclerosis. The study included patients with full or almost full visual acuity, without visual field defects or any other ophthalmic condition, and who had never undergone any ocular surgery or trauma. The reference group consisted of 49 eyes of 37 patients. This group included healthy subjects with full visual acuity. Contrast sensitivity was examined with a Functional Vision Analyzerâ„¢ device in photopic conditions (with and without glare) and in mesopic conditions (with and without glare).In patients with multiple sclerosis who had experienced optic neuritis, contrast sensitivity was found to be significantly reduced in all spatial frequencies in both mesopic and photopic conditions (with and without glare).Contrast sensitivity in patients with multiple sclerosis who have also had optic neuritis is significantly reduced. This may explain patients' complaints regarding their quality of vision, despite good visual acuity. Contrastometry is a useful basis for further examination, providing additional information regarding a patient's quality of vision.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677004","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Optic neuritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuritis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.777674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.644641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Eye surgery","weight":0.515098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_surgery"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.49285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.387409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Photopic vision","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision"},{"name":"Contrast sensitivity","weight":0.278118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_sensitivity"},{"name":"Spatial frequency","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_frequency"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Mesopic vision","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopic_vision"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Glare (vision)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_(vision)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"}]}
