{"id":88887,"title":"Outcome of locking compression plating for proximal humeral fractures: a prospective study.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcome of open reduction and internal fixation using locking compression plates for proximal humeral fractures.54 men and 16 women aged 28 to 79 (mean, 54) years underwent open reduction and internal fixation using a locking compression plate for closed 2-part (n=22), 3-part (n=38), and 4-part (n=10) proximal humeral fractures. 10 of the patients also had dislocation of the humeral head; 4 had fractures extending to the shaft. Wound condition, functional outcome, bone union, amount of collapse, and malalignment were assessed. Functional outcome was assessed using the Constant-Murley score. RESULTS; The mean follow-up period was 15 (range, 6-24) months. All fractures achieved union after a mean of 9 (range, 6-12) weeks. The mean Constant-Murley scores for the injured and normal shoulders were 72 and 82, respectively (88% of normal). The final outcome was excellent in 14 patients, good in 28, moderate in 22, and poor in 6. In the latter 6 patients, 2 had screw penetration, 2 had plate impingement, one had a mal-reduced greater tuberosity, and one had adhesive capsulitis. All were preventable. In all, 18 patients had 20 complications: subacromial impingement of the plate (n=6), mal-reduction of the greater tuberosity (n=6), screw penetration (n=2), adhesive capsulitis (n=2), superficial infection (n=2), and haematoma (n=2); 12 of these complications were technique-related.Locking proximal humeral plates enabled stable fixation in all Neer-type proximal humeral fractures. Most complications were technique-related.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781604","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.751623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.527547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.448912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.34897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.134583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Adhesive capsulitis of shoulder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive_capsulitis_of_shoulder"},{"name":"Greater tubercle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_tubercle"},{"name":"Subacromial bursitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subacromial_bursitis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Upper extremity of humerus","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_extremity_of_humerus"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Rugby union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union"},{"name":"624","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/624"},{"name":"Axle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Curse of 1940","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_1940"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Tubercle (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubercle_(anatomy)"}]}
