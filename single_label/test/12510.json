{"id":12510,"title":"Advancing the discovery of medications for autism spectrum disorder using new technologies to reveal social brain circuitry in rodents.","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition characterized by core differences and impairments in social behavioral functioning. There are no approved medications for improving social cognition and behavior in ASD, and the underlying mechanisms needed to discover safer, more effective medications are unclear.In this review, we diagram the basic neurocircuitry governing social behaviors in order to provide a neurobiological framework for the origins of the core social behavioral symptoms of ASD. In addition, we discuss recent technological innovations in research tools that provide unprecedented observation of cellular morphology and activity deep within the intact brain and permit the precise control of discrete brain regions and specific cell types at distinct developmental stages.The use of new technologies to reveal the neural circuits underlying social behavioral impairments associated with ASD is advancing our understanding of the brain changes underlying ASD and enabling the discovery of novel and effective therapeutic interventions.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522332","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.735773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.611436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.552053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.433738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.378001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.281821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.22836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social cognition","weight":0.183105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Biological neural network","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network"},{"name":"List of regions in the human brain","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain"},{"name":"Diagram","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Electronic circuit","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Organization development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_development"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"},{"name":"Psychosexual development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosexual_development"}]}
