{"id":67375,"title":"Tubular damage and worsening renal function in chronic heart failure.","abstract":"This study sought to investigate the relationship between tubular damage and worsening renal function (WRF) in chronic heart failure (HF) BACKGROUND: WRF is associated with poor outcome in chronic HF. It is unclear whether urinary tubular markers may identify patients at risk for WRF.In 2,011 patients with chronic HF, we evaluated the ability of urinary tubular markers (N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to predict WRF. Finally, we assessed the prognostic importance of WRF.A total of 290 patients (14.4%) experienced WRF during follow-up, and WRF was a strong and independent predictor of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.87; 95% CI: 2.40 to 3.43; p < 0.001). Patients with WRF had lower baseline glomerular filtration rate and higher KIM-1, NAG, and NGAL levels. In a multivariable-adjusted model, KIM-1 was the strongest independent predictor of WRF (HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.39 per log increase; p = 0.001).","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621973","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.788203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.69265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.473664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Lipocalin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipocalin"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Lumber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Weather Research and Forecasting model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Research_and_Forecasting_model"},{"name":"KIM-1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIM-1"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"}]}
