{"id":43077,"title":"Routine versus selective histologic analysis of gallbladder specimens for the detection of incidental gallbladder cancers. A retrospective review over 9 years of activity with a special focus on patients' age.","abstract":"Incidental gallbladder cancer (IGC) is an infrequent possibility in patients undergoing cholecystectomies. Routine histologic examination of all gallbladder specimens is the current approach to detect this disease. Our study presents the influence of age to perform a selective histologic analysis.A retrospective review was conducted of all gallbladder specimens during the last 9 years in our hospital. The medical notes were retrieved for cases of IGC or dysplasia and perioperative data were collected.A total of 3,330 cholecystectomies were conducted over the study period, 3,041 for gallstone disease. Twelve patients were found with dysplasia and 13 patients with IGC, all of them occurred in gallbladders removed for gallstone diseases. There were 18 men with a median age of 65 years (range 18 to 85). Median age for cancer patients was 70 years (range 51 to 85) and 54 years for dysplasia (range 18 to 75). No patient below the age of 51 years (n = 1,464) experienced IGCs.Age should be considered as an additional factor for a selective approach to the histologic analysis of all gallbladder specimens following cholecystectomies.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811928","annotations":[{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.274482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.253147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.227075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Intergovernmental Conference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Conference"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
