{"id":81238,"title":"Efficacy of Philips Sonicare AirFloss compared to manual brushing and flossing: an in vitro study.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the difference in reduction of an interproximal surface coating with the use of Sonicare Airfloss, tooth brushing or dental flossing since there are currently no articles available comparing dental flossing to Sonicare Airfloss. Three groups of six typodont teeth were sprayed with Occlude Indicator Spray as a test surface coating. Each group was treated with one removal method: Sonicare Airfloss, tooth brushing or dental flossing. In all groups, when used as a single removal method, Sonicare Airfloss resulted in the least removal of the surface coating when compared to either tooth brushing or flossing.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241500","annotations":[{"name":"Dental floss","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_floss"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.17949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.129465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Philips","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips"},{"name":"Sonicare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonicare"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Tooth brushing","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing"}]}
