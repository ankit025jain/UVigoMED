{"id":31265,"title":"Serum and ascitic fluid serotonin levels and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid urine excretion in the liver of cirrhotic patients with encephalopathy.","abstract":"The excess and deficit of serotonin can be the cause of somatic and mental disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate serotonin levels in blood and ascitic fluid as well as excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE).The study included 75 alcoholic cirrhotic patients divided into 3 groups (HE1, HE2, HE3), 25 patients each, with grade 1, 2 and 3 of hepatic encephalopathy according to West-Haven classification. The control group (C) included 25 clinically healthy volunteers. Venous blood and ascitic fluid were collected in fasting. On the same day a 24-hour urine collection was performed. Immunoenzymatic method was used to determine the serotonin level in serum and ascitic fluid, and 5-HIAA in urine (IBL-RE-59121, RE-59131).In the control group, mean serum serotonin level (ng/ml) was 155.5 ± 38.1 and in the 3 study groups: HE1 - 175.2 ± 32.4 (NS), HE2 - 137.2 ± 28.6 (NS), HE3 - 108.3 ± 46.3 (p<0.001). Serotonin concentration in ascitic fluid was on the average about 25% of its level in serum. The excretion of 5-HIAA in urine (mg/24h) in all groups, was: C - 5.9 ± 2.1, HE1 - 5.8 ± 1.8 (NS), HE2 - 4.8 ± 1.2(NS), HE3 - 4.3 ± 1.3 (p<0.05).The results of our study indicate that serum and ascitic fluid level of serotonin and urine excretion of 5-HIAA depends on the grade of hepatic encephalopathy. In patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy serotonin concentration in blood is decreased which can affect some clinical manifestation of this disease.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24384770","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatic encephalopathy","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.556269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.515019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.505445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.47565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.242258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
