{"id":24689,"title":"[B lymphocytes: a promising target to treat atherosclerosis?].","abstract":"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall. It is already well established that several immune cells (macrophages, T lymphocytes, etc.) modulate atherosclerosis progression whereas the role of the different subpopulations of B lymphocytes emerged only recently. B1 lymphocytes secrete protective IgM antibodies that act as scavenger of deleterious molecules whereas B2 lymphocytes probably worsen the disease by activating pro-inflammatory T lymphocytes. The outcome of these opposite functional properties of B lymphocytes on the evolution of arterial lesions may vary depending on their local environment during the different stages of the disease. In this review, we emphasize recent progresses in understanding the specific contribution of B lymphocytes to atherosclerosis and discuss the interest of targeting them to improve therapy.
