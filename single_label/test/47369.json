{"id":47369,"title":"Hepatitis C virus: here comes all-oral treatment.","abstract":"Treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is evolving rapidly. The approval in 2013 of two new direct-acting antivirals-sofosbuvir (a polymerase inhibitor) and simeprevir (a second-generation protease inhibitor)-opens the door for an all-oral regimen, potentially avoiding interferon and its harsh side effects. Other direct-acting antivirals are under development.
