{"id":37917,"title":"[Early multi-disciplinary intervention reduces neurological disability in premature infants].","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-disciplinary treatment approaches in reducing neurological disabilities in premature infants.A total of 117 infants who were born premature in our hospital between March 2008 and February 2010 but had no congenital malformations and no severe neonatal complications, were enrolled in this study. They were randomly allocated to a multi-disciplinary treatment group (n=63) and a control group (n=54). While patients in the control group underwent an early conventional treatment, those in the multi-disciplinary treatment group were subjected to regular development monitoring, neurological examination and screening for brain injury, neuro-nutrition and neurodevelopment therapies, and rehabilitation training.The incidence rates of abnormalities in posture, reflex, sleep, muscle tone and EEG were significantly lower in the multi-disciplinary treatment group than in the control froup (P<0.05) at corrected postnatal ages of 6-12 months. At corrected postnatal ages of 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, both mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) scores were significantly higher in the multi-disciplinary treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05). At corrected postnatal age of 3 years, incidence rates of cerebral palsy, language barrier, abnormal muscle tone and hearing impairment were significantly lower in the multi-disciplinary treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05).Early multi-disciplinary intervention approaches may significantly improve mental and motor developments and reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy-associated neurological disabilities in premature infants.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
