{"id":82070,"title":"Celecoxib exerts protective effects on extracellular matrix metabolism of mandibular condylar chondrocytes under excessive mechanical stress.","abstract":"Excessive mechanical stress is considered a major cause of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA). High magnitude cyclic tensile strain (CTS) up-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in chondrocytes, while selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition has been shown to be beneficial to cytokine-induced cartilage damage. However, the effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors on mechanically stimulated chondrocytes remains unclear. This study evaluated the effect of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism of mandibular condylar chondrocytes under CTS.Porcine mandibular chondrocytes were subjected to CTS of 0.5 Hz, 10% elongation with celecoxib for 24 h. The gene expressions of COX-2, MMPs, aggrecanase (ADAMTS), type II collagen and aggrecan were examined by real-time PCR. Also, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations were determined using enzyme immunoassay kit. The levels of MMP and transcription factor NF-?B were measured by western blot while MMP activity was determined by casein zymography.The presence of celecoxib normalized the release of PGE2 and diminished the CTS-induced COX-2, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9 and ADAMTS-5 gene expressions while recovered the downregulated type II collagen and aggrecan gene expressions. Concurrently, celecoxib showed inhibition of NF-?B and suppression of MMP production and activity.Celecoxib exerts protective effects on mandibular condylar chondrocytes under CTS stimulation by diminishing degradation and restoring synthesis of ECM.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Stomatognathic
