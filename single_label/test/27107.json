{"id":27107,"title":"[Relationship between 'ideal' cardiovascular behaviors and factors and the incidence of hypertension].","abstract":"To explore the relationship between 'ideal' cardiovascular behaviors and factors and the incidence of hypertension.A prospective cohort study including 52 133 workers who had participated in the 2006-2007 Kailuan health examination without history of cerebral infraction, myocardial infarction or hypertension but with complete data, was carried out. All workers were followed on their occurrence of hypertension. According to the AHA definition of 'ideal' cardiovascular health behaviors and factors, the cumulative incidence rates of hypertension in different groups were calculated under the life table method, and compared by Log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard rations and 95% confidence intervals for baseline behaviors and factors.The cumulative incidence rates of hypertension according 0-1, 2, 3, 4, 5-7 ideal cardiovascular health behaviors and factors were 65.72%, 59.14%, 54.59%, 50.24% and 34.22%, respectively in the 0-1, 2, 3, 4, 5-7 groups. Data from the Cox proportional hazards model showed that after adjusting for age, education level and family history of hypertension, the ones who had 2, 3, 4, 5-7 ideal cardiovascular behaviors/factors were 0.75, 0.69, 0.63, 0.36 times more than those who had 0-1 ideal behaviors.The incidence of hypertension and risk reduced along with the increase of ideal cardiovascular health behaviors and factors.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059354","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.797888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.760052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.753216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Life table","weight":0.71905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.515948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.418165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.417541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.376462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.113871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0492285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Decrement table","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decrement_table"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"American Heart Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Follow-on","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow-on"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Infraction","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infraction"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
