{"id":90837,"title":"Enlarged coronary artery pseudoaneurysm after drug-eluting stent implantation.","abstract":"A 73-year-old man with 2-vessel coronary artery disease underwent a staged percutaneous coronary intervention that resulted in rupture of the right coronary artery and pseudoaneurysm formation. Although the pseudoaneurysm regressed over a week, it reexpanded after a year. Resection of the pseudoaneurysm and coronary artery bypass grafting were performed. The drug-eluting stent at the coronary artery injury site may have delayed healing and remodeling of the artery, thus contributing to reexpansion of the pseudoaneurysm.
