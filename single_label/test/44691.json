{"id":44691,"title":"[HBx silencing by shRNA down-regulates MMP-2 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell HepG2.2.15].","abstract":"To observe the effects of HBx shRNA on MMP-2 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell HepG2.2.15.HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with psiHBV/X plasmid using Lipofectamine(TM);2000. The silencing efficacy was evaluated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) detecting the expression of HBx gene. The proliferation of HepG2.2.15 cells was examined by MTT assay. The expression levels of MMP-2 mRNA and protein were assayed by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively.RT-PCR showed that the efficiency of RNA interference of HBx gene was 53.6%. MTT detection revealed that the cell proliferation was inhibited at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the transfection (0.388±0.087, 0.623±0.016, 0.997±0.036) and the differences had statistically significance as compared with the control group (0.436±0.027, 0.731±0.017, 1.105±0.051) (P<0.05). The qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed that the expression of MMP-2 decreased at both mRNA and protein levels, and the differences had statistically significance as compared with the control group (P<0.05).HBx gene RNA interference can inhibit the cell proliferation and down-regulate the expression of MMP-2 in HepG2.2.15 cells.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721404","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.897423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.866808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.833729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.310822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Small hairpin RNA","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hairpin_RNA"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.23303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.208843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.116551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
