{"id":91284,"title":"Treatment of postoperative lower extremity wounds using human fibroblast-derived dermis: a retrospective analysis.","abstract":"Human fibroblast-derived dermis skin substitute is a well-studied treatment for diabetic foot ulcers; however, no case series currently exist for its use in healing postoperative wounds of the lower extremity. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 32 lower extremity postoperative wounds treated weekly with human fibroblast-derived dermis skin substitute. Postoperative wounds were defined as a wound resulting from an open partial foot amputation, surgical wound dehiscence, or nonhealing surgical wound of the lower extremity. Wound surface area was calculated at 4 and 12 weeks or until wound closure if prior to 12 weeks. Postoperative wounds treated with weekly applications showed mean improvement in surface area reduction of 63.6% at 4 weeks and 96.1% at 12 weeks. More than 56% of all wounds healed prior to the 12-week endpoint. Additionally, only one adverse event was noted in this group. This retrospective review supports the use of human fibroblast-derived dermis skin substitute in the treatment of postoperative lower extremity wounds. This advanced wound care therapy aids in decreased total healing time and increased rate of healing for not only diabetic foot wounds but also postoperative wounds of the lower extremity, as demonstrated by this retrospective review.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521756","annotations":[{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.457237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.400727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.231296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"}]}
