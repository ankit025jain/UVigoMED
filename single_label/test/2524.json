{"id":2524,"title":"Incidentally elevated thyrotropin in otherwise properly treated hypothyroid patients does not require higher levothyroxine dose.","abstract":"In 20 properly treated hypothyroid patients with normal thyrotropin (TSH) values during previous observation, TSH was incidentally mildly/moderately elevated (4.5-8.0 mIU/L; normal values 0.4-4.0) on the last follow up. However, they were continuously treated with the same levothyroxine (LT4) dose (mean: 95 ?g) and six months later all TSH values normalized. The authors suggest that the physicians, in response to incidentally increased TSH value in otherwise properly treated hypothyroid patients, refrain from prompt increasing the LT4 dose unless TSH values are persistently elevated or/and progressing.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509238","annotations":[{"name":"Physician","weight":0.152786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Levothyroxine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Lieutenant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant"},{"name":"Refrain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
