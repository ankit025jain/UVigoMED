{"id":2804,"title":"Contrast sensitivity and foveal microstructure following vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane.","abstract":"To evaluate contrast sensitivity (CS) in patients with epiretinal membrane (ERM) following vitrectomy and to investigate the relationship between CS and foveal microstructures with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).Thirty-one eyes of 31 patients with ERM were included. We examined CS with a CSV-1000E chart, a logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and foveal microstructure by using SD-OCT before and at 6 months after surgery. From the CS data, the area under the log contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF) was calculated. Based on the OCT images, we quantified the mean thickness of the ganglion cell layer (GCL), the inner nuclear layer (INL), and the outer retinal layer (outer nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer [ONL+OPL]). The status of the photoreceptor inner and outer segment junction (IS/OS) and external limiting membrane (ELM) was also evaluated.Vitrectomy significantly improved logMAR BCVA and AULCSF. Even in patients with poor improvement of visual acuity (changes in logMAR BCVA by surgery was ?0.2), postoperative AULCSF significantly increased by treatment (P < 0.05). Postoperative AULCSF showed a significant correlation with preoperative (P < 0.05) and postoperative (P < 0.05) ONL+OPL thickness, whereas other parameters were not relevant. Postoperative logMAR BCVA significantly correlated with postoperative status of IS/OS (P < 0.05) and preoperative ONL+OPL thickness (P < 0.05).In patients with ERM, CS improved even though their visual acuity did not recover significantly by vitrectomy. CS was associated with the thickness of outer retinal layer.","date":"2014-11-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370511","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Ganglion cell","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Outer nuclear layer","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Outer plexiform layer","weight":0.816971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_plexiform_layer"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Inner nuclear layer","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Ganglion cell layer","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell_layer"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.800148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Contrast sensitivity","weight":0.77913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_sensitivity"},{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.657355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.49285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.328751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.22095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.193284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Comma-separated values","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"},{"name":"Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory_of_Swiss_Heritage_Sites"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Microstructure","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
