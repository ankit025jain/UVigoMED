{"id":61560,"title":"Copy neutral loss of heterozygosity in 20q in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.","abstract":"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based chromosome microarray analysis was used to uncover copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the long arm of chromosome 20 in blood or bone marrow specimens from three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). All three patients presented with lymph node enlargement. Whereas one of the patients has had a complicated clinical course, the other two have a more indolent disease. Sequence analysis of the tumor suppressor gene ASXL1, which is located in 20q and is commonly mutated in malignant myeloid diseases and occasionally in CLL/SLL specimens, revealed no mutations in our three patients with copy neutral LOH in 20q. The possible contribution of other imprinted microRNAs and antisense genes residing in 20q to the pathogenesis of a subset of CLL/SLL patients is discussed. These findings illustrate the value of SNP arrays for the detection of novel recurrent genomic alterations that may contribute to CLL/SLL onset or progression.
