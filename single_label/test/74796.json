{"id":74796,"title":"Transitions between care settings in dementia: are they relevant in economic terms?","abstract":"This study was performed to assess the economic effect of interventions affecting transitions between dementia care settings in Germany.A Markov-model that models the course of dementia with respect to typical care setting transitions was derived. Model data and parameters were retrieved by literature reviews. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for parameter uncertainty.In the base case, the expected present value of remaining lifetime costs is â‚¬25,326 for each cohort member. As a function of effectiveness, pharmaceutical interventions may reduce the costs by 2% to 13% and psychosocial interventions come with savings of 1% to 10%. A structural intervention-promoting group living as a substitute for nursing home care increases costs by 2% to 8%. Sensitivity analyses indicate high variance and variability of results, as well as valuation of informal care being a crucial parameter.There are economic benefits of delayed transitions to institutional settings, especially from the viewpoint of statutory care insurances, but these do unlikely exceed intervention costs. Thus, further intervention effects should be considered. Ultimately, concentrating research on preventive and protective factors of dementia could lead to an efficient intervention from every perspective.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25236991","annotations":[{"name":"Probability","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.509879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.483995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Determinism","weight":0.466076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.43366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.422766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.336263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Present value","weight":0.0952762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.065579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Statute","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Interventionism (politics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventionism_(politics)"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Mathematical induction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Valuation (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Transitions (The Wire)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitions_(The_Wire)"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"}]}
