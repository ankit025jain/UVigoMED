{"id":43336,"title":"Survival, mortality and morbidity outcomes after oesophagogastric cancer surgery in New South Wales, 2001-2008.","abstract":"To examine the relationship between hospital volume and patient outcomes for New South Wales hospitals performing oesophagectomy and gastrectomy for oesophagogastric cancer.A retrospective, population-based cohort study of NSW residents diagnosed with a new case of invasive oesophageal or gastric cancer who underwent oesophagectomy or gastrectomy between 2001 and 2008 in NSW hospitals using linked de-identified data from the NSW Central Cancer Registry, the National Death Index and the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection. A higher-volume hospital was defined as one performing > 6 relevant procedures per year.Odds ratios for > 21-day length of stay, 28-day unplanned readmission, 30-day mortality and 90-day mortality, and hazard ratios (HRs) for 5-year absolute and conditional survival.Oesophagectomy (908 patients) and gastrectomy (1621 patients) were undertaken in 42 and 84 hospitals, respectively, between 2001 and 2008. Median annual hospital volume ranged from 2 to 4 for oesophagectomies and ranged from 2 to 3 for gastrectomies. Controlling for known confounders, no associations between hospital volume and > 21-day length of stay and 28-day unplanned readmission were found. Overall 30-day mortality was 4.1% and 4.4% for oesophagectomy and gastrectomy, respectively. Five-year absolute survival was significantly better for patients who underwent oesophagectomy in higher-volume hospitals (adjusted HR for lower-volume hospitals, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.10-1.49]; P = 0.002) and for those with localised gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy in higher-volume hospitals (adjusted HR for lower-volume hospitals, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.28-2.61]; P = 0.001).These data support initial surgery for oesophagogastric cancer in higher-volume hospitals.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794674","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.761904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.724672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.669775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.643089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.615797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.417791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.370863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"New South Wales","weight":0.281463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.198494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.116667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Wales","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Home run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"1621","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1621"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"908","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/908"},{"name":"Absolute monarchy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Odds (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_(band)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"South Wales","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Photoperiodism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism"},{"name":"Conditional probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
