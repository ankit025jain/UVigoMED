{"id":89563,"title":"Therapeutic efficacy of antibiotic-loaded gelatin microsphere/silk fibroin scaffolds in infected full-thickness burns.","abstract":"Despite advances in burn treatment, burn infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In this study, an antibacterial silk fibroin (SF) scaffold for burn treatment was designed; gelatin microspheres (GMs) were impregnated with the antibiotic gentamycin sulfate (GS), and the GS-impregnated GMs were then embedded in a SF matrix to fabricate GS/GM/SF scaffolds. The developed GS/GM/SF scaffolds could serve as a dermal regeneration template in full-thickness burns. The average pore size and porosity of the GS/GM/SF scaffolds were 40-80 ?m and 85%, respectively. Furthermore, the drug release rate of the scaffolds was significantly slower than that of either GS/GM or GS/SF scaffolds. And the composite scaffold exhibited stronger antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hence, we evaluated the wound-healing effects and antibacterial properties of the GS/GM/SF scaffolds in a rat full-thickness burn infection model. Over 21 days, the GS/GM/SF scaffolds not only significantly reduced burn infection by P. aeruginosa but also accelerated the regeneration of the dermis and exhibited higher epithelialization rates than did GS/SF and SF scaffolds. Thus, GS/GM/SF scaffolds are potentially effective for treatment of full-thickness infected burns, and GS/GM/SF scaffolds are a promising therapeutic tool for severely burned patients.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704698","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Keratin","weight":0.862887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.671565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Sweat gland","weight":0.654816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"},{"name":"Silk","weight":0.585571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.567968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.544231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.525535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.496535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.382676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.334742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Fibroin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroin"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Microsphere","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsphere"}]}
