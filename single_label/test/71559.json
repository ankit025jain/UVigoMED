{"id":71559,"title":"Knee reconstruction with endoprosthesis after extra-articular and intra-articular resection of osteosarcoma.","abstract":"Extra-articular resection is necessary to obtain a wide margin for primary osteosarcomas invading the knee joint, and the limb is often reconstructed using a prosthesis. Here, outcomes of extra-articular and intra-articular procedures were compared.Between 1999 and 2012, 14 patients with osteosarcoma underwent extra-articular excision (n = 6; ages 23-65 years; mean follow-up 82.8 months) or intra-articular excision (n = 8; ages 8-58 years; mean follow-up 96.4 months). In the extra-articular group, there was one Enneking Stage IIA case and five Enneking Stage IIB cases. No local recurrences were noted in either group.Patient outcomes were as follows (extra-articular cases vs. intra-articular cases): continuous disease-free (2 vs. 7), alive with disease (2 vs. 0) and death from disease (1 vs. 1). Average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional scores were 69.4% (range 63.3-83.3%) and 88.3% (range 70.0-96.7%) in the extra-articular and intra-articular groups, respectively, constituting a significant difference (P < 0.05). The 5-year oncological overall survival exceeded 80% in both groups. Amputation was necessary for one patient in the extra-articular group. The 5-year event-free prosthesis survival rates in the extra-articular and intra-articular groups were 33.3 and 75.0%, respectively (P < 0.05).The extra-articular excision group developed more complications than the intra-articular excision group, as a result of extensive bone and muscle excision. The limb survival rates were similar in both groups. Our results suggest that extra-articular resection was a necessary and clinically acceptable procedure.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25057091","annotations":[{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.81272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.516628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.39209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.156462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.13054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"858","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/858"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"24th century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_century"},{"name":"Type II string theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_string_theory"},{"name":"John Joseph Enneking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joseph_Enneking"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Institute of Internal Auditors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Internal_Auditors"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"}]}
