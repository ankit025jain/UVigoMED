{"id":66083,"title":"Detection of uric acid stones in the ureter using low- and conventional-dose computed tomography.","abstract":"To determine the ability of low- and conventional-dose computed tomography (CT) in identification of uric acid stones, which are of lower density than calcium oxalate stones.Uric acid stones (3, 5, and 7 mm) were randomly placed in human cadaveric ureters and scanned using conventional 140-mAs and low-dose 70-, 50-, 30-, 15-, 7.5-, and 5-mAs settings. A single-blinded radiologist reviewed a total of 523 scanned stone images. Sensitivity and specificity were compared among different settings and stone sizes.Imaging using 140-, 70-, 50-, 30-, 15-, 7.5-, and 5-mAs settings resulted in 97%, 97%, 96%, 93%, 83%, 83%, and 69% sensitivity and 92%, 92%, 91%, 89%, 88%, 91%, and 94% specificity, respectively. There was a significant difference in sensitivity between 140 mAs and 15, 7.5, and 5 mAs (P = .011, P = .011, and P <.001, respectively). Sensitivity for 3-, 5-, and 7-mm stones was 83%, 90%, and 93%, respectively. At ? 15 mAs, 3-mm stones had a higher rate of false negatives (P <.001).Both low- and conventional-dose CTs demonstrate excellent sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ureteral uric acid stones. However, low-dose CT at ? 15 mAs resulted in reduced detection of uric acid stones.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746662","annotations":[{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Calcium oxalate","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_oxalate"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Oxalate","weight":0.47492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.145737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"523","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/523"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Photographic film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film"}]}
