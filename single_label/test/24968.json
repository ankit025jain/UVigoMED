{"id":24968,"title":"Nebivolol, but not metoprolol, lowers blood pressure in nitric oxide-sensitive human hypertension.","abstract":"Nebivolol, unlike other selective ?1-receptor blockers, induces vasodilation attributable to increased NO bioavailability. The relative contribution of this mechanism to the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of nebivolol is unclear because it is normally masked by baroreflex buffering. Autonomic failure provides a unique model of hypertension devoid of autonomic modulation but sensitive to the hypotensive effects of NO potentiation. We tested the hypothesis that nebivolol would decrease BP in these patients through a mechanism independent of ?-blockade. We randomized 20 autonomic failure patients with supine hypertension (14 men; 69±2 years) to receive a single oral dose of placebo, nebivolol 5 mg, metoprolol 50 mg (negative control), and sildenafil 25 mg (positive control) on separate nights in a double-blind, crossover study. Supine BP was monitored every 2 hours from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am. Compared with placebo, sildenafil and nebivolol decreased systolic BP during the night (P<0.001 and P=0.036, by mixed-effects model, maximal systolic BP reduction 8-hour postdrug of -20±6 and -24±9 mm Hg, respectively), whereas metoprolol had no effect. In a subanalysis, we divided patients into sildenafil responders (BP fall>20 mm Hg at 4:00 am) and nonresponders. Nebivolol significantly lowered systolic BP in sildenafil responders (-44±13 mm Hg) but not in nonresponders (1±11 mm Hg). Despite lowering nighttime BP, nebivolol did not worsen morning orthostatic tolerance compared with placebo. In conclusion, nebivolol effectively lowered supine hypertension in autonomic failure, independent of ?1-blockade. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO potentiation contributes significantly to the antihypertensive effect of nebivolol.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25267802","annotations":[{"name":"Sildenafil","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil"},{"name":"Baroreflex","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroreflex"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Metoprolol","weight":0.781905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoprolol"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.762627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.720071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Orthostatic hypotension","weight":0.635912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.541654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.250302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.24426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.196132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.15266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Nebivolol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebivolol"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Pure autonomic failure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_autonomic_failure"}]}
