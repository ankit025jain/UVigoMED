{"id":46065,"title":"Identification of commensal flora-associated antigen as a pathogenetic factor of autoimmune pancreatitis.","abstract":"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a chronic fibro-inflammatory disease of the pancreas constituting, in part, a recently defined nosological entity of IgG4-related systemic sclerosing diseases. The pathogenetic factors of AIP have not been fully elucidated. We previously established a mouse model of AIP using chronic exposure to a commensal bacteria, Escherichia coli.To determine the pathogenetically relevant antigen of E. coli, the outer membrane fractions of E. coli were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting against sera from the AIP model. Immunoreactive spots were determined using MALDI TOF/MS and Mascot search. The recombinant protein of the identified antigen was examined for their ability to induce AIP-like disorder in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, the antibody titer against that antigen was determined in AIP patients.One representative spot reacting with sera from E. coli-inoculated mice was identified as FliC from E. coli, based on the results of TOF/MS. The repeated inoculation of recombinant FliC in C57BL/6 mice induced AIP-like pancreatitis and higher titers of anti-lactoferrin and anti-carbonic anhydrase II. Sera from patients with AIP had the highest antibody titer, while those from patients with pancreatic diseases other than AIP had a higher antibody titer against E. coli and FliC, compared with pancreatic disease-free controls.FliC from E. coli may pathogenetically generate an AIP-like inflammation status. A reconsideration of the importance of commensal bacteria as an environmental factor(s) capable of inducing autoimmunity could provide insight to overcoming AIP.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650962","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.821322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.819321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.797488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.776563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.750883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.747203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.708486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.526523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.324431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Nosology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosology"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Demyelinating disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demyelinating_disease"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"}]}
