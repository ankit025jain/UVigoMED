{"id":88671,"title":"Women are more than twice as likely to die from burns as men in Australia and New Zealand: an unexpected finding of the Burns Evaluation And Mortality (BEAM) Study.","abstract":"While the risk of death after nonthermal trauma and sepsis may be higher for men, sex differences in outcome after burns are inconsistently reported. The Burns Evaluation And Mortality Study examined the outcomes of all patients admitted after thermal injury to the intensive care unit (ICU) at 8 of 9 burn referral centers in Australia and New Zealand between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011. There were 348 women and 1367 men treated for acute burns. Women were older, had more extensive burns, and higher severity of illness scores. Women spent longer in hospital and in ICU than men. Mortality among women was higher than in men (21% vs 8.3%, P<.001). Trends toward a survival disadvantage for women were seen across all ages, at all levels of severity of illness, at every proportion of body surface area burnt, and across all centers. After adjusting for confounding factors, women had more than double the risk of death compared with men (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-4.01; P=.002). Our study conclusively shows worse outcomes for women with burns admitted to ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. Further research is required to determine why this is happening.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810730","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.84377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.647319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.598868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.504678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.471167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.421586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.340282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.239737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.239737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"1367","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1367"},{"name":"384","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/384"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Happening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happening"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Double (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Trends (short story)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_(short_story)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Military unit","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"}]}
