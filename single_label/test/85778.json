{"id":85778,"title":"[Advances on driver oncogenes of squamous cell lung cancer].","abstract":"?????????????????????????????????????non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????40%?????????????????????????1?fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, FGFR1???????????????????????Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Next to adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is the most frequent histologic subtype in non-small cell lung cancer. Several molecular alterations have been defined as \"driver oncogenes\" responsible for both the initiation and maintenance of the malignancy. The squamous cell carcinoma of the lung has recently shown peculiar molecular characteristics which relate with both carcinogenesis and response to targeted drugs. So far, about 40% of lung squamous cell carcinoma has been found harbouring driver oncogenes, in which fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays important roles. In this review, we will report the mainly advances on some latest driver mutations of squamous cell lung cancer.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854563","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.587928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor","weight":0.402521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor_1"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"}]}
