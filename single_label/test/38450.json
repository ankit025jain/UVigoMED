{"id":38450,"title":"The clinical and molecular characterization of patients with dyshormonogenic congenital hypothyroidism reveals specific diagnostic clues for DUOX2 defects.","abstract":"Mutations in the DUOX2 gene have been associated with transient or permanent congenital hypothyroidism due to a dyshormonogenic defect.This study aimed to verify the prevalence of DUOX2 mutations and the associated clinical features in children selected by criteria supporting a partial iodide organification defect (PIOD).Thirty children with PIOD-like criteria were enrolled and genotyped. A detailed clinical characterization was undertaken together with the functional analysis of the DUOX2 variations and the revision of the clinical and molecular data of the literature.In this large selected series, the prevalence of the DUOX2 mutations was high (37%). We identified 12 missense variants, one splice site, and three frameshift DUOX2 mutations. Functional analyses showed significant impairment of H2O2 generation with five missense variants. Stop-codon mutants were shown to totally abolish DUOX2 activity by nonsense-mediated RNA decay, exon skipping, or protein truncation. DUOX2 mutations, either mono- or biallelic, were most frequently associated with permanent congenital hypothyroidism. Moreover, the present data suggested that, together with goiter and PIOD, the most significant features to select patients for the DUOX2 analysis are the low free T4 and the high TSH concentrations at the first postnatal serum sampling, despite borderline blood spot TSH. Interestingly, the analysis of previously described DUOX2 mutated cases confirmed the validity of these findings.The defects in the peroxide generation system are common among congenital hypothyroidism patients with PIOD. The most robust clinical parameters for selecting patients for DUOX2 analysis have been identified, and several DUOX2 variants have been functionally characterized.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423310","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.741597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.554716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.440539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Translational frameshift","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.310969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.284345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.26851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Morpholino","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpholino"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.115057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Congenital hypothyroidism","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
