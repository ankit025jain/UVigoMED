{"id":68248,"title":"[Variocele in adolescents].","abstract":"Up to 20% of adolescents have a varicocele. Often a varicocele is an incidental finding during a physical examination. However, adolescents with a varicocele might suffer from pain or they may have noticed a difference in the volume of the testes. The diagnostic investigation of the ejaculate in adolescents is difficult because no age-dependent spermiogram standard values exist. Endocrinological tests are also difficult because of the physiological variability of testosterone and gonadotropins during adolescence. The difference in testes volume normalizes in half of the boys without any therapy during maturation. Most adolescents with a varicocele have a normal semen analysis. The sperm parameters are the most important factor for treatment decision making.If sperm concentration, motility, and morphology are normal, active surveillance with regular control examinations are recommended even if the volume of the testis is divergent. Pathologic sperm parameters should lead to an operative treatment. The microsurgical subinguinal technique is the method of choice due to the low complication and reoperation rates. The sperm concentration, morphology, and motility increase postoperatively as well as the volume of the testis. It is not clear whether the improved sperm parameters lead to improved spontaneous pregnancy rates later in life. Whether scrotal pain decreases after operative therapy is uncertain because of the subjectivity of pain.Until now there are only a few studies with small and very heterogeneous case numbers so that no clear recommendation for the treatment of a varicocele in adolescents can be made. The difficulty in the treatment decision-making is preventing reduced fertility, while avoiding overtreatment.
