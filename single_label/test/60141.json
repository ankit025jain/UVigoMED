{"id":60141,"title":"[Effects of rapamycin on biological characteristics of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from patients with aplastic anemia].","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the effects of rapamycin on biological function and autophagy of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) from patients with aplastic anemia so as to provide experimental basis for the clinical treatment of aplastic anemia (AA) with rapamycin. BM-MSC were treated with different concentrations of rapamycin (0, 10, 50, 100 nmol/L) for 48 h, the expression of LC3B protein was detected by Western blot to observe the effect of rapamycin on cell autophagy; cell apoptosis and cell cycles were detected by flow cytometry; the proliferation of BM-MSC of AA patients was measured by cell counting kit-8; the adipogenic differentiation of BM-MSC were tested by oil red O staining after adipogenic induction for 2 weeks; the adipogenic related genes (LPL, CFD, PPAR?) were detected by real-time PCR. The results showed that the proliferation and adipogenesis of BM-MSC of AA patients were inhibited by rapamycin. Moreover, the autophagy and apoptosis of BM-MSC were increased by rapamycin in a dose-dependent way.Rapamycin arrested the BM-MSC in G0/G1 phase and prevented them into S phase (P < 0.05). It is concluded that rapamycin plays an critical role in inhibiting cell proliferation, cell cycles, and adipogenesis, these effects may be related with the autophagy activation and mTOR inhibition resulting from rapamycin.
