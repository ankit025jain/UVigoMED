{"id":73400,"title":"Perceived barriers to mammography among underserved women in a Breast Health Center Outreach Program.","abstract":"To investigate perceived barriers to mammography among underserved women, we asked participants in the Siteman Cancer Center Mammography Outreach Registry-developed in 2006 to evaluate mobile mammography's effectiveness among the underserved-why they believed women did not get mammograms.The responses of approximately 9,000 registrants were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. We report adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) significant at 2-tailed P values less than .05.Fears of cost (40%), mammogram-related pain (13%), and bad news (13%) were the most commonly reported barriers. Having insurance was associated with not perceiving cost as a barrier (OR .44, 95% CI .40 to .49), but with perceiving fear of both mammogram-related pain (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.60) and receiving bad news (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.60) as barriers.Despite free services, underserved women continue to report experiential and psychological obstacles to mammography, suggesting the need for more targeted education and outreach in this population.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908357","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.470113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.304565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.265789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.119479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"News","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Experience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Outreach","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outreach"}]}
