{"id":70346,"title":"Development of a novel in vivo cancer model using cell sheet engineering.","abstract":"Standard in vivo cancer models entail injecting single cancer cells, but this technique is not always successful. We developed a novel cancer cell sheet by using temperature-responsive polymer poly(N-isopropyl acryl amide)-coated plates, which allow controlled attachment and detachment of living cancer cells via simple temperature changes.Four human cancer cell lines were used to make cell sheets. The cancer cell sheets were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice and compared regarding their tumor-forming ability with the conventional cell suspension technique.Human cancer cell sheets were successfully transplanted into nude mice. The cancer cell sheets resulted in stable engraftment and showed a higher tumor volume determined by total flux with the IVISÂ® imaging system.Novel cancer cell sheets are useful tools to make in vivo cancer models in mice for the assessment of anticancer therapeutics.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25202053","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.729491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.630593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.533491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.446933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.356689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.304374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.211311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.203971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Acryloyl group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acryloyl_group"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Flux","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Fee tail","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_tail"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
