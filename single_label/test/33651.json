{"id":33651,"title":"Post-operative left atrioventricular valve function after the staged repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect with tetralogy of Fallot.","abstract":"This study reviewed surgical outcomes of staged repair for complete atrioventricular septal defect with tetralogy of Fallot, especially with focusing on the post-operative left-sided atrioventricular valve function.Between 1992 and 2013, 10 patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect with tetralogy of Fallot underwent total correction by the following surgical strategy. Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt was placed at first at the mean age of 1.5 ± 1.3 months. Then confirming sufficient development of the left heart structures, the total correction was performed at the mean age of 1.4 ± 0.6 years. Second shunt was required in 4 (40 %) patients to develop the left heart structures.The left ventricular end-diastolic volume before total correction was 127 ± 30 % of normal size. The two-patch repair was applied in 8 (80 %) patients. There was no mortality, and 1 reoperation case for left-sided atrioventricular valve regurgitation. The follow-up was completed on all patients and the mean follow-up period was 7.4 ± 7.0 years. The post-operative left-sided atrioventricular valve regurgitation kept less than moderate for 10-year follow-up in all patients except one patient who required the repair of left-sided atrioventricular valve 1 year after the total correction.The post-operative left-sided atrioventricular valve function after the repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect with tetralogy of Fallot maintained with the application of the two-patch repair, early and repeated palliative systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, and the early definitive surgery.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803092","annotations":[{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Left heart","weight":0.637187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_heart"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.545297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.408618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.3769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.252852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Atrioventricular septal defect","weight":0.195833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Tetralogy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy"},{"name":"Atrioventricular node","weight":0.0208776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_node"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"}]}
