{"id":43355,"title":"Ileocolic intussusception secondary to gastrointestinal stromal tumor in a 61-year-old.","abstract":"Intussusception is a common emergency in patients age of 3 months to 5 years. In adults, the diagnosis is infrequent but must be considered in the clinical setting of abdominal pain and vomiting. We present a case of a 61-year-old woman presenting with epigastric abdominal pain and vomiting, diagnosed with intussusception secondary to gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Serial bedside ultrasound examinations uncovered the diagnosis of intussusception, confirmed by computed tomographic scan during a paroxysm of pain. Intussusception has a much higher predilection for neoplasms in adults, with a high morbidity and mortality, so early recognition is critical in improving patient outcomes.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792936","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor","weight":0.755011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.708421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Epigastrium","weight":0.674419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigastrium"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.625983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.59486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Intussusception (medical disorder)","weight":0.353049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intussusception_(medical_disorder)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.314089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.134165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Ileocolic artery","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileocolic_artery"}]}
