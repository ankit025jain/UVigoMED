{"id":57756,"title":"Dienogest in the treatment of endometriosis.","abstract":"Dienogest (DNG) is an oral progestin, derivative of 19-nortestosterone, that has recently been introduced for the treatment of endometriosis.This review examines the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of DNG in the treatment of endometriosis. The material included in the current manuscript was searched and obtained via Medline, Pubmed and EMBASE, from inception until February 2014. The term 'dienogest' was associated with the following search terms: 'endometriosis', 'pharmacokinetics', 'safety' and 'efficacy'.Several trials demonstrated the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of DNG. However the use of DNG is associated with some limitations. So far, no study investigated the potential of contraceptive effect of this treatment and therefore, it should be recommended with other methods of contraception (e.g., barrier methods). A further limitation of the use of DNG as daily therapy in the long term is that the cost of the therapy is higher than other progestins available on the market and combined oral contraceptives. Therefore, future studies should be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of DNG with other progestins.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069386","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.685231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"Contraception","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraception"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Progestin","weight":0.62325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.514089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.487567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Nandrolone","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandrolone"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Digital Negative","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Negative"},{"name":"Dienogest","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dienogest"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Search engine technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_technology"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Barrier contraception","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_contraception"}]}
