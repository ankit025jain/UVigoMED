{"id":55870,"title":"Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography epithelial and flap thickness mapping in femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis.","abstract":"To evaluate the change of epithelial and flap thickness after femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) in correlation with the spherical equivalent refraction treated and clinical outcomes.Prospective, randomized, contralateral-eye study.Forty myopic eyes underwent LASIK using an excimer laser with refraction ranging from -1.00 to -7.25 diopters (mean -3.25Â±1.9). Flap creation was randomized between eyes, using the IntraLASE FS60 laser (IL) in 1 eye and WaveLight FS200 laser (FS) in the contralateral eye. SD OCT was used to evaluate the epithelial and flap thickness profiles and corneal power preoperatively and at 1 week and 1, 3, and 9 months postoperatively. Manifest and wavefront refractions were performed at each postoperative visit.Statistically significant epithelial thickening was observed in both IL and FS groups as early as 1 month postoperatively (P=.033 and P=.042), but this stabilized between 3 (P=.042 and P=.035) and 9 months (P=.043 and P=.041). Femtosecond-LASIK flaps were thicker in the IL group in comparison to the FS group at 3 and 9 months postoperatively (P=.003 and P=.005, respectively). There was a statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of preoperative myopic refraction and the central epithelial thickness at 1, 3, and 9 months (Pearson correlation coefficients 0.485, 0.587 and 0.576) (P=.0021, P=.0010, and P=.0011), respectively. SD OCT corneal power maps showed steepening at 3 and 9 months along with mild myopic shift.Progressive epithelial and flap thickening with increased corneal power were observed after femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis for myopia with consequent stabilization between 3 to 9 months postoperatively. The magnitude of epithelial and flap thickness remodeling correlated to the preoperative myopic refractive error.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792107","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.874168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.842079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.650072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.508151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.430886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.416132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.408251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.380281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Excimer","weight":0.181209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
