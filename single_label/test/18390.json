{"id":18390,"title":"Genetic characterization of emerging coxsackievirus A12 associated with hand, foot and mouth disease in Qingdao, China.","abstract":"To characterize the genetic properties of coxsackievirus A12 (CVA12) strains isolated from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) patients in Qingdao during 2008-2011, the complete genome and VP1 coding region were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains from China clustered into three different branches, suggesting multiple lineages of CVA12 co-circulating in Asia. Sequence analysis indicated a monophyletic group only when the P1 region was examined, indicating possible recombination between CVA12 and other HEV-A serotypes. The emergence of CVA12 involved in an HFMD outbreak in China is a public-health issue.
