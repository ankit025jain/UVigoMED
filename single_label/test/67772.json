{"id":67772,"title":"A systematic review on the accuracy of diagnostic procedures for infravesical obstruction in boys.","abstract":"Infravesical obstruction leads to kidney and bladder dysfunction in a significant proportion of boys. The aim of this review is to determine the value of diagnostic tests for ascertainment of infravesical obstruction in boys.We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases until January 1, 2013, to identify papers that described original diagnostic accuracy research for infravesical obstruction in boys. We extracted information on (1) patient characteristics and clinical presentation of PUV and (2) diagnostic pathway, (3) diagnostic accuracy measures and (4) assessed risk of bias.We retrieved 15 studies describing various diagnostic pathways in 1,189 boys suspected for infravesical obstruction. The included studies reflect a broad clinical spectrum of patients, but all failed to present a standardised approach to confirm the presence and severity of obstruction. The risk of bias of included studies is rather high due to work-up bias and missing data.As a consequence of low quality of methods of the available studies we put little confidence in the reported estimates for the diagnostic accuracy of US, VCUG and new additional tests for ruling in or ruling out infravesical obstruction. To date, firm evidence to support common diagnostic pathways is lacking. Hence, we are unable to draw conclusions on diagnostic accuracy of tests for infravesical obstruction. In order to be able to standardise the diagnostic pathway for infravesical obstruction, adequate design and transparent reporting is mandatory.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586242","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.54584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.197756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Missing data","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Draw (chess)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_(chess)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
