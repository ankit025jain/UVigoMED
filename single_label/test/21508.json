{"id":21508,"title":"Breast gangrene: a rare source of severe sepsis.","abstract":"We present a very rare case of breast gangrene in a 26-year-old woman, lactating primipara, referred to the emergency department of our hospital with a 1-day history of difficulty in breathing, high-grade fever associated with chills and rigor and failure to pass urine. After initial resuscitation, stabilisation and thorough examination her right breast was found to be gangrenous, with satellite lesions at the periphery. Later, under local anaesthesia and appropriate antibiotic coverage, the patient was taken for emergency debridement. She gradually recovered and as the wound developed healthy granulation tissue and wound culture became sterile, grafting of the affected area was carried out. The graft took well following which she was discharged.
