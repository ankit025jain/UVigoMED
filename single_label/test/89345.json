{"id":89345,"title":"[Cerebral vein thrombosis secondary to closed head injury. Report of one case].","abstract":"Intracranial sinus thrombosis (1ST) after closed head injury is an uncommon but potentially serious complication. It has no correlation with the severity of the injury. The symptoms and clinical course are highly variable. The most frequent but least specific symptom is severe headache. Cerebral lesions and neurologic signs develop in half of patients with IST. We report a 29 year-old male who had an IST after a severe closed head injury. The patient initially developed headache and had later 2 secondarily generalized seizures. The magnetic resonance imaging showed a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin and intravenous phenytoin was started. At the moment of this report he is asymptomatic and continues with oral anticoagulants and phenytoin.
