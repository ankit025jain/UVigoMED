{"id":76614,"title":"Social environment factors, diet quality, and body weight in 12-year-old children from four public schools in Puerto Rico.","abstract":"To explore the association of social-environment (SE) factors and diet quality (DQ) with weight status in a group of children in Puerto Rico (PR).A cross-sectional study in a sample of 114 12-year-old children enrolled in 4 public schools in the San Juan Metropolitan area in Puerto Rico (PR) during the 2012-2013 school year. These children completed a self-administered questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics and SE, with information on family meal patterns; parental feeding styles; parental, peer, and school support for healthy eating; physical activity (PA); and frequency of PA and sedentary times. The participants also completed at 24-hour dietary recall interview to determine DQ. This was assessed with the Healthy Eating Index (HIE)-2010, an instrument that evaluates compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated and categorized as healthy weight, overweight, or obese.36% of participants were overweight/obese. In terms of DQ, 55% had \"poor\" DQ, 45% had diets that \"need improvement\", and none had \"good\" DQ. Children of healthy weight (75.0%) reported more frequent family meals than did overweight/obese children (57.5%; p = 0.05). No other significant associations were found between SE factors and DQ or body weight status.Most of the participants were of healthy weight but had poor quality diets. Having a healthy weight was positively associated with frequent family meals.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964643","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.935531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.52352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.520292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.382524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.261872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.261748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Human nutrition","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nutrition"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"School","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0553703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Academic term","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Nutrition_Policy_and_Promotion"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Professional wrestling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Music genre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre"},{"name":"San Juan, Puerto Rico","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
