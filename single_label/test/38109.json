{"id":38109,"title":"Small bowel intussusception in a pregnant woman with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome.","abstract":"Intussusception is the most frequent complication of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS), but usually seen in child age. It is a predictable, but infrequent complication in adults with PJS. However, there is no report about intussusception in pregnancy period secondary to Peutz-Jeghers (PJ) polyps in the literature. In this paper, we present a rare intussusception case in a pregnant woman with PJS, which was diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging, and discuss this condition with a brief literature review.
