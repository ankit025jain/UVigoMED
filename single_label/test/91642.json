{"id":91642,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of supported employment for veterans with spinal cord injuries.","abstract":"To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a supported employment (SE) intervention that had been previously found effective in veterans with spinal cord injuries (SCIs).Cost-effectiveness analysis, using cost and quality-of-life data gathered in a trial of SE for veterans with SCI.SCI centers in the Veterans Health Administration.Subjects (N=157) who completed a study of SE in 6 SCI centers. Subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention of SE (n=81) or treatment as usual (n=76).A vocational rehabilitation program of SE for veterans with SCI.Costs and quality-adjusted life years, which were estimated from the Veterans Rand 36-Item Health Survey, extrapolated to Veterans Rand 6 Dimension utilities.Average cost for the SE intervention was $1821. In 1 year of follow-up, estimated total costs, including health care utilization and travel expenses, and average quality-adjusted life years were not significantly different between groups, suggesting the Spinal Cord Injury Vocational Integration Program intervention was not cost-effective compared with usual care.An intensive program of SE for veterans with SCI, which is more effective in achieving competitive employment, is not cost-effective after 1 year of follow-up. Longer follow-up and a larger study sample will be necessary to determine whether SE yields benefits and is cost-effective in the long run for a population with SCI.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486426","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.576605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.543645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.465742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.180912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Public utility","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility"},{"name":"Veteran","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Veterans Health Administration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1821","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1821"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Extrapolation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Long run and short run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_run_and_short_run"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Average cost","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_cost"},{"name":"Vocational rehabilitation","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Vocational education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Racial integration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_integration"},{"name":"Health administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_administration"},{"name":"Longer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longer"},{"name":"Supported employment","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supported_employment"}]}
