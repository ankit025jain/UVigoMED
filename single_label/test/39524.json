{"id":39524,"title":"Association between serum concentration of infliximab and efficacy in adult patients with ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"We analyzed data collected during the Active Ulcerative Colitis Trials (ACT-1 and ACT-2) to assess relationships between serum concentrations of infliximab and outcomes of adults with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.We compared serum concentrations of infliximab with outcomes of 728 patients with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis who participated in ACT-1 or ACT-2; efficacy data were collected at weeks 8, 30, and 54 (for ACT-1 only). Relationships between serum concentration of infliximab and efficacy outcomes were assessed using trend, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. We also evaluated factors that affected the relationship between exposure and response.Median serum concentrations of infliximab at weeks 8, 30, and/or 54 were significantly higher in patients with clinical response, mucosal healing, and/or clinical remission than in patients who did not meet these response criteria. There were statistically significant relationships between quartile of infliximab serum concentration and efficacy at these time points (P < .01). Infliximab therapy was effective for a smaller proportion of patients in the lowest quartile, and these patients had lower serum levels of albumin and a higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab than patients in other quartiles. Although the relationship between exposure to infliximab and response varied among patients, approximate serum concentrations of 41 ?g/mL infliximab at week 8 of induction therapy and 3.7 ?g/mL at steady-state during maintenance therapy produced optimal outcomes in patients.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25173754","annotations":[{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.867897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.700897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infliximab","weight":0.643186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.642332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.528889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.233668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.0804046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0263793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"ACT (test)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_(test)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
