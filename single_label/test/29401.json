{"id":29401,"title":"Time-dependent comparative evaluation of some important biomarkers of acute cyanide poisoning in rats: an aid in diagnosis.","abstract":"The study focuses on time-dependent comparative evaluation of various biomarkers of acute cyanide poisoning in rats.Blood gas (analyzer), lactate, pyruvate, cyanide, thiocyanate (spectrophotometer) and 2-amino-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (ATCA; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) in plasma or urine, and various physiological parameters (polygraph) were measured.Cyanide poisoning was characterized by elevated lactate, cyanide, thiocyanate and ATCA concentrations in plasma up to 15?min, 4, 16 and 24?h, respectively, while high urinary thiocyanate and ATCA levels were measured between 4 and 24?h.ATCA concentration in plasma and urine was found to be more reliable indicator of cyanide poisoning.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670138","annotations":[{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Carboxylic acid","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid"},{"name":"Pyruvic acid","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Cyanide","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.728598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Cyanide poisoning","weight":0.645374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.589221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Thiocyanate","weight":0.400303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiocyanate"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.152321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.149844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0860629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Polygraph","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
