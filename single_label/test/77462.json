{"id":77462,"title":"[Health survey of painting and coating workers in an automobile manufacturing enterprise in Guangzhou, China].","abstract":"To investigate the health status of painting and coating workers in an automobile manufacturing enterprise in Guangzhou, China and analyze the influential factors for the health status of these workers, and to provide health intervention measures and strategies.Typical sampling was used to select an automobile manufacturing enterprise; according to whether the subjects were in contact with paint and coatings, paint spraying workers in the painting workshop were selected as the exposed group, and the staff in the administration, procurement, and marketing departments as the control group. Physical examination was performed by doctors among these subjects.The exposed group had significantly higher positive rates of dizziness, headache, bleeding gums, chest tightness, and skin itching than the control group (P < 0.05). The exposed group had a nonsignificantly higher rate of abnormal ECG than the control group (P > 0.05), but the exposed group had a significantly higher incidence of various blocks (P = 0.020) and significantly lower leukocyte count, erythrocyte count, and male workers' hemoglobin level (P < 0.05), as compared with the control group.Volatile organic solvents have adverse effect on the health of paint spraying workers in the automobile manufacturing enterprise, so regular physical examination should be performed to strengthen health interventions and improve health.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754941","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood
