{"id":84592,"title":"Comparison of occlusion break responses and vacuum rise times of phacoemulsification systems.","abstract":"Occlusion break surge during phacoemulsification cataract surgery can lead to potential surgical complications. The purpose of this study was to quantify occlusion break surge and vacuum rise time of current phacoemulsification systems used in cataract surgery.Occlusion break surge at vacuum pressures between 200 and 600 mmHg was assessed with the Infiniti速 Vision System, the WhiteStar Signature速 Phacoemulsification System, and the Centurion速 Vision System using gravity-fed fluidics. Centurion Active FluidicsTM were also tested at multiple intraoperative pressure target settings. Vacuum rise time was evaluated for Infiniti, WhiteStar Signature, Centurion, and Stellaris速 Vision Enhancement systems. Rise time to vacuum limits of 400 and 600 mmHg was assessed at flow rates of 30 and 60 cc/minute. Occlusion break surge was analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance.The Centurion system exhibited substantially less occlusion break surge than the other systems tested. Surge area with Centurion Active Fluidics was similar to gravity fluidics at an equivalent bottle height. At all Centurion Active Fluidics intraoperative pressure target settings tested, surge was smaller than with Infiniti and WhiteStar Signature. Infiniti had the fastest vacuum rise time and Stellaris had the slowest. No system tested reached the 600-mmHg vacuum limit.In this laboratory study, Centurion had the least occlusion break surge and similar vacuum rise times compared with the other systems tested. Reducing occlusion break surge may increase safety of phacoemulsification cataract surgery.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074069","annotations":[{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.507422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.352671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gravitation","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Infiniti","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniti"},{"name":"Fluidics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluidics"},{"name":"Rise time","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_time"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Bottle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Surge (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_(comics)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Limit (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"},{"name":"The Centurion (1961 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Centurion_(1961_film)"},{"name":"Stellaris (comics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellaris_(comics)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"}]}
