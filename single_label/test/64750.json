{"id":64750,"title":"[Application of gene knockout technology in spermatogenesis-associated gene study].","abstract":"The gene approach to the pathogenesis of male infertility may bring about some strategies for the diagnosis and manage of the condition. Gene knockout technology is the mainstream method currently used in the study of gene function. Screening and identification of testis-specific genes and insights into their features and functions in spermatogenesis are significant for a further understanding of testicular functions and searching for new therapeutic targets for male reproductive disorders. This review focuses on the application of gene knockout technology in the study of spermatogenesis-associated genes.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306817","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Spermatogenesis","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogenesis"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.783879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.617984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.403582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Sex and illness","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_illness"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Mainstream","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
