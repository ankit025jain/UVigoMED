{"id":86945,"title":"[Implication of PML nuclear bodies in intrinsic and innate immunity].","abstract":"PML/TRIM19 is the organizer of PML nuclear bodies (NB), large multiprotein structures associated to the nuclear matrix, which recruit a great number of proteins and which are implicated in various cellular processes including antiviral defense. The conjugation of PML to SUMO is required for the formation and function of PML NB. Alternative splicing from a single PML gene generates several PML isoforms (PMLI to PMLVIIb), each harboring a specific carboxy-terminal region. This variability allows each isoform to recruit different partners and thus confers them specific functions. PML gene is directly induced by interferon and certain PML isoforms are implicated in its antiviral properties, as they display intrinsic antiviral activities against RNA or DNA viruses. One isoform, PMLIV, is also implicated in innate immunity by enhancing IFN-? production during a viral infection. Here we review recent findings on PML/TRIM19 implication in interferon response and antiviral defense, at the interface between intrinsic and innate immunity.
