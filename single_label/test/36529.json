{"id":36529,"title":"Minimally invasive pediatric surgery in uncomplicated congenital heart disease.","abstract":"We aimed to highlight the use of a minimally invasive approach in uncomplicated congenital heart surgery.We investigated retrospectively 32 children below 10 years of age who underwent elective closure of ostium secundum type (n?=?27), sinus venosus type (n?=?4) and ostium primum type (n?=?1) atrial septal defects through a limited skin incision and partial lower sternotomy between August 2001 and December 2008. All patients had cannulation through the same incision for cardiopulmonary bypass.A pericardial patch was used to close the defect in 8 patients and direct suturing in 24. The mean time from the skin incision to cannulation was 56?±?23?min. Total bypass time was 27?±?12?min, and crossclamp time was 15?±?8?min. Mean length of hospital stay was 4?±?2 days. We did not encounter any complications or mortality.A minimally invasive approach, consisting of a limited skin incision and partial lower sternotomy, is a safe, reliable, and cosmetically advantageous method in uncomplicated congenital heart disease surgery, which can be performed widely, and may replace the standard approach without increasing mortality and morbidity.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570522","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.597221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.476247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.385295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Pediatric surgery","weight":0.175391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_surgery"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.169228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Sinus venosus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_venosus"},{"name":"Primary interatrial foramen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_interatrial_foramen"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Septum primum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum_primum"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
