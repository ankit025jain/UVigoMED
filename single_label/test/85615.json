{"id":85615,"title":"Prophylactic antibiotic therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","abstract":"CLINICAL QUESTION Is prophylactic antibiotic treatment associated with fewer exacerbations or improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? BOTTOM LINE Continuous macrolide antibiotic use for prophylaxis was associated with a clinically significant reduction in COPD exacerbations. Pulsed antibiotic use was not associated with benefit. Continuous and pulsed antibiotics were associated with improved HRQOL, but this was not clinically significant.
