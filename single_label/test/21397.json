{"id":21397,"title":"[Development and application of microbiology data monitoring system (Akita-ReNICS) for networking hospitals in Akita Prefecture].","abstract":"Networking among regional hospitals recently became required for infection control activities in Japan. In Akita prefecture, we developed a microbiology data warehouse for networking hospital laboratories in 2010. Designated users can easily obtain microbiology data and compare it with other participating hospitals using this system. For example, users are able to compare the MRSA/MSSA ratio in Staphylococcus aureus with other participating hospitals in Akita-ReNICS. The effectiveness and assignment of this system were shown by a questionnaire administrated in 2013. In this paper, we clarify the current state and assignment of Akita-ReNICS and consider its effective application for better infection control activities.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605549","annotations":[{"name":"Japan","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.492733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Warehouse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse"},{"name":"Akita Prefecture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_Prefecture"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Data warehouse","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Prefecture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefecture"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"}]}
