{"id":43912,"title":"Genomic analysis of drug resistant gastric cancer cell lines by combining mRNA and microRNA expression profiling.","abstract":"Understanding the mechanism underlying multidrug resistance and identifying effective targets that can overcome it is of critical importance. In this study, mRNA and miRNA expression profiling of the drug resistant sublines, SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR, and their parental gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 were performed. A significant number of genes and a limited subset of miRNAs were commonly dysregulated, which were further validated using qRT-PCR. GO and KEGG pathway analyses of the commonly dysregulated genes indicated that the MAPK signalling pathway may be involved in multidrug resistance, which was further validated using immunoblotting and MTT assay. Finally a primary multidrug resistance network in gastric cancer, consisting of the commonly dysregulated genes and miRNAs, was established and functional miRNA-mRNA pairs were identified. The commonly dysregulated genes and miRNAs identified in this study may represent good therapeutic targets and further study of these targets may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying multidrug resistance.
