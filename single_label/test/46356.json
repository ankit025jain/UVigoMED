{"id":46356,"title":"Postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding after an orthotopic liver transplant: a single-center experience.","abstract":"The overall incidence, causes, and treatment of posttransplant gastrointestinal bleeding, have been previously described. In this study, we examined the causes and treatment of postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding after orthotopic liver transplant.Clinical data of 335 patients who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant at our institution between September 2001 and December 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis and treatment of postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding after an orthotopic liver transplant were reviewed.Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 13 patients (3.8%) after an orthotopic liver transplant. Five patients (38.4%) were adult and 8 patients (61.6%) were pediatric. The sites of the bleeding were Roux-en-Y anastomosis bleeding in 5 cases, peptic ulcer in 3 cases, erosive gastritis in 3 cases, gastric and esophageal varices in 1 case, and hemobilia in 1 case. These 13 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding were managed with conservative treatment, endoscopic treatment, radiologic interventional embolism, or exploratory laparotomy. No patients died because of gastro--intestinal bleeding. During follow-up, 4 patients died because of sepsis and 1 patient died of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.Gastrointestinal bleeding after liver transplant and its incidence, causes, and treatment are not well-described in the literature. Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal bleeding requires a multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, hepatologists, advanced and experienced endoscopists, and interventional radiologists.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635817","annotations":[{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.656507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.622487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.390559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.294198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Haemobilia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemobilia"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
