{"id":56008,"title":"Long-term comparison using Ex-PRESS glaucoma shunt in black and white patients.","abstract":"To compare clinical outcomes, including patterns of failure, using the Ex-PRESS glaucoma shunt, in black and white patients with open-angle glaucoma.Retrospective comparative study.Sixty-three eyes of 50 black patients and 44 eyes of 34 white patients with open-angle glaucoma.The Ex-PRESS shunt procedure was performed for uncontrolled glaucoma in a series of white and black patients with glaucoma. Success was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) between 5 and 18 mm Hg, 20% reduction from baseline, with or without suture lysis or adjuvant medication, but no additional glaucoma surgery.Mean length of follow-up was 29 months (range 12-81 months) for black patients and 25 months (range 12-66 months) for white patients. Mean preoperative IOP was 27 ± 7.2 and 30 ± 7.7 mm Hg for black and white patients, respectively. Mean postoperative IOP was 13 ± 3.6 and 12 ± 3.3 mm Hg for black and white patients, respectively. Using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the success rates were 77.6% and 95% at 12 months for black and white patients, respectively. The log-rank test for comparison of survival curves indicated a significant difference between the 2 groups at 12 months (p = 0 .015) but revealed no difference at 2 years (p = 0.462).This study shows that patterns of failure between black and white patients treated with the Ex-PRESS glaucoma shunt change significantly with the passage of time. Black patients experience failure early, whereas white patients experience failure later at a greater pace resulting in a similar survival rate at 2 years.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767229","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.381855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.326757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.297123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.295649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.280998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.138084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1266","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1266"},{"name":"1281","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1281"},{"name":"Black-and-white","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Black","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Glaucoma surgery","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma_surgery"}]}
