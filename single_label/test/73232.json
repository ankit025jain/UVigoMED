{"id":73232,"title":"Correlation of BRAF and NRAS mutation status with outcome, site of distant metastasis and response to chemotherapy in metastatic melanoma.","abstract":"The prognostic significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in metastatic melanoma patients remains uncertain, with several studies reporting conflicting results, often biased by the inclusion of patients treated with BRAF and MEK (MAPK) inhibitors. We therefore interrogated a historical cohort of patients free of the confounding influence of MAPK inhibitor therapy.Patients with available archival tissue first diagnosed with metastatic melanoma between 2002 and 2006 were analysed. Mutational analysis was performed using the OncoCarta Panel. Patient characteristics, treatment outcome and survival were correlated with BRAF/NRAS mutation status.In 193 patients, 92 (48%) melanomas were BRAF-mutant, 39 (20%) were NRAS-mutant and 62 (32%) were wild-type for BRAF/NRAS mutations (wt). There was no difference in response to chemotherapy based on mutation status (35-37%). The distant disease-free interval (DDFI) was significantly shorter in patients with wt melanoma (27.9 months vs 35.1 for BRAF and 49.1 for NRAS) although this was not significant in multivariate analysis. Survival from stage IV melanoma diagnosis was not significantly different based on mutation status. The DDFI was significantly shorter in patients with BRAF(V600K/R) versus BRAF(V600E) melanoma in univariate and multivariate analyses.BRAF and NRAS mutation status does not influence survival in metastatic melanoma.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918823","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.854429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.695777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.642728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.624916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.313178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0602563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.0568868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma_RAS_viral_oncogene_homolog"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0266129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Archive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive"},{"name":"Bias of an estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator"},{"name":"Mutation testing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Interrogation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogation"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
