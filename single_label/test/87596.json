{"id":87596,"title":"Teleradiology for remote consultation using iPad improves the use of health system human resources for paediatric fractures: prospective controlled study in a tertiary care hospital in Italy.","abstract":"The growing cost of health care and lack of specialised staff have set e-Health high on the European political agenda. In a prospective study we evaluated the effect of providing images for remote consultation through an iPad on the number of in-hospital orthopaedic consultations for children with bone fractures.Children from 0 to 18 years diagnosed with a bone fracture by the radiologist during the hours when an orthopaedic service is provided only on-call were eligible for enrollment. Cases were enrolled prospectively during September and October 2013. A standard approach (verbal information only, no X-Ray provided remotely) was compared to an experimental approach (standard approach plus the provision of X-ray for remote consultation through an iPad). The primary outcome was the number of orthopaedic in-hospital consultations that occurred. Other outcomes included: immediate activation of other services; time needed for decision-making; technical difficulties; quality of images and diagnostic confidence (on a likert scale of 1 to 10).Forty-two children were enrolled in the study. Number of in-hospital consultancies dropped from 32/42 (76.1%) when no X-ray was provided to 16/42 (38%) when the X-rays was provided (p < 0.001). With remote X-ray consultation in 14/42 (33.3%) cases services such as surgery and plaster room could be immediately activated, compared to no service activated without teleradiology (p < 0.001). Average time for decision making was 23.4 ± 21.8 minutes with remote X-ray consultation, compared to 56.2 ± 16.1 when the X-ray was not provided (p < 0.001). The comparison between images on the iPad and on the standard system for X- Ray visualisation resulted in a non statistically significant difference in the quality of images (average score 9.89 ± 0.37 vs 9.91 ± 0.30; p = 0.79), and in non statistically significant difference in diagnostic confidence (average score 9.91 ± 0.32 vs 9.92 ± 0.31; p = 0.88).Remote X-ray consultation through Aycan OsiriX PRO and iPad should be considered as a means for reducing the need of in-hospital orthopaedic consultation during on-call times, and potentially decrease the cost of care for the health system. In the future, alternative systems less expensive than Aycan OsiriX PRO should be further developed and tested.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070705","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.690567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.629802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.608877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.56601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"EHealth","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EHealth"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.419028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.137884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.120568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Motion of no confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Visualization (computer graphics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Political agenda","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_agenda"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0131816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"}]}
