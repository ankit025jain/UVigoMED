{"id":1176,"title":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Acute and rapidly reversible left ventricular dysfunction may be triggered by various emotional and physical insults. The most common precipitant being the death of a close family member but the other reported precipitants include court appearance, fear of a procedure, arguments and surprise parties and reunions. This entity is now well known as stress cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We report a case of rapidly reversible left ventricular dysfunction following attempted suicide by hanging.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25438493","annotations":[{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.713313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.447139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.344357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hanging","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Insult","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult"},{"name":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Political party","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"},{"name":"Parasuicide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasuicide"},{"name":"Argument","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument"}]}
