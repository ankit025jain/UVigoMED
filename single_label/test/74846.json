{"id":74846,"title":"[Randomized controlled clinical trials of individualized treatment of cerebral palsy children by warm-reinforcing needling combined with Bobath rehabilitation training].","abstract":"To observe the effect of warm-reinforcing needling combined with modern rehabilitation training on motor function of cerebral palsy (CP) children.Sixty cases of CP children were randomly divided into acupuncture combined with rehabilitation (Acu + Rehab, n = 30) group and Rehab (n = 30) group. Patients of the Acu + Rehab group were treated by warm-reinforcing needling stimulation of Jiaji (EX-B 2), Jianyu (LI 15), Quchi (LI 11), Hegu (LI 4), Zusanli (ST 36), Yinlingquan (GB 34), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Juegu (GB 39), Yanglingquan (GB 34), etc., combined with Bobath rehabilitation therapy, and those of the Rehab group treated by Bobath rehabilitation (stimulating key control points in the body, triggering reflexes that provide head and body control). The treatment was conducted every day,with three months being a therapeutic course,two courses in all. The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 (PDMS-2) was used to evaluate the CP children's motor function [1) gross motor: posture (straightness ratio), locomotion and object manipulation; 2) fine motor: grasping and visual-Motor integration].After the treatment, of the 30 and 30 cases in the Acu+ Rehab and Rehab groups, 1 (3.33%) and 0 (0%) were cured, 20 (66.67%) and 18 (60.00%) experienced marked improvement, 9 (30.00%) and 12 (40.00%) were invalid, with the effective rates being 70.00% and 60.00% respectively. The therapeutic effect of the Acu + Rehab group was markedly superior to that of the Rehab group (P < 0.05). After 6 months ' treatment, the scores of posture, locomotor, object manipulation and grasping, and visual-movement integration were significantly increased in comparison with pre-treatment in the same one group (P < 0.05), and the effects of the Acu + Rehab group were obviously superior to those of Rehab group in increasing the scores of posture, locomotor, object manipulation and grasping after 6 months' treatment (P < 0.05).Warm-reinforcing needling combined with Bobath rehabilitation has a better therapeutic effect in improving gross motor and fine motor functions of CP children.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219129","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled
