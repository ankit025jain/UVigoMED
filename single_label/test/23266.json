{"id":23266,"title":"Controlled-release injectable containing terbinafine/PLGA microspheres for onychomycosis treatment.","abstract":"Controlled-release drug delivery systems based on biodegradable polymers have been extensively evaluated for use in localized drug delivery. In the present study, intralesionally injectable poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres for controlled release of terbinafine hydrochloride (TH) was developed for treating fungal toe/finger nail infections. TH-PLGA microspheres were formulated using O/W emulsification and modified solvent extraction/evaporation technique. Microspheres were evaluated for particle size and size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, surface, and morphology. The in vitro drug release profile was studied in aqueous media as well as in 1% agar gel. Microspheres system was also evaluated in excised cadaver toe model, and extent of TH accumulation in nail bed, nail plate, and nail matrix was measured at different time points. Microspheres were found to provide consistent and sustained TH release. Intralesional administration of controlled-release microspheres can be a potential alternative mode of treating fungus-infected toe and/or finger nails.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial
