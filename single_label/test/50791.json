{"id":50791,"title":"[Neuropad test for sudomotor function to predict the risk of diabetic foot ulceration].","abstract":"To assess the predictive value of Neuropad test on occurrence of diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) among type 2 diabetic patients.We divided 725 cases of type 2 diabetic patients into the high-risk and the non-high-risk groups of DFU based on the results of vibration perception thresholds(VPT) examination, which was widely used as a criteria for predicting DFU. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the effectiveness of Neuropad with 10 g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (10 g SWMF) testing in predicting the risk of DFU.Among 725 patients of type 2 diabetes, 6.1% were at a high risk of DFU. Compared to non-high-risk group, patients in high-risk group had older age, longer diabetes duration, higher values of complete colour change time (CCC time) of Neuropad and higher abnormal rate of 10 g SWMF (P<0.01). CCC time of Neuropad was shown to be better in predicting the risk of DFU than 10 g SWMF, and the area under the ROC curve was about 0.8, and the best cut-off value was 22.25 min.Neuropad is an effective means for predicting of the risk of DFU, and can be used to prevent diabetic foot ulceration.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752109","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.199306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.195936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Monofilament fishing line","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monofilament_fishing_line"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Civilian Conservation Corps","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Chromatophore","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Vibration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
