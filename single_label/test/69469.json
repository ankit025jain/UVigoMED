{"id":69469,"title":"Clinical significance and biological roles of CARMA3 in human bladder carcinoma.","abstract":"Caspase recruitment domain and membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like domain protein 3 (CARMA3) was reported as an oncoprotein overexpressed in several cancers. The expression pattern of CARMA3 and its clinical significance in human bladder cancer have not been well characterized. In the present study, CARMA3 expression was analyzed in 90 archived bladder cancer specimens using immunohistochemistry, and the correlation between CARMA3 expression and clinicopathological parameters was evaluated. We found that CARMA3 was overexpressed in 35 of 90 (38.8%) bladder cancer specimens. Significant association was observed between CARMA3 overexpression with tumor status (p?=?0.081) and tumor grade (p?=?0.027). To further explore the biological functions of CARMA3 in bladder cancer, we depleted CARMA3 in T24 and 5637 cell lines using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and colony formation assay, we were able to show that CARMA3 depletion inhibited cell proliferation and colony number. Further study demonstrated that CARMA3 depletion decreased an expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) targets cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 expression, as well as I?B phosphorylation. Luciferase reporter assay showed that CARMA3 depletion could downregulate NF-?B reporter activity. In conclusion, CARMA3 is overexpressed in bladder cancer and regulates malignant cell growth and NF-?B signaling, which makes CARMA3 a candidate therapeutic target for bladder cancer.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443255","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.853583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.759224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.636922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.496564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.4922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.471829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.355833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.271811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
