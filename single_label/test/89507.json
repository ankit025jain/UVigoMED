{"id":89507,"title":"Clinical impact of sacroplasty on patient mobility.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of sacroplasty on patient mobility and pain when performed as a treatment for sacral insufficiency fractures.Imaging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scan confirmed the diagnosis of sacral insufficiency fractures. Baseline clinical mobility scale (CMS) score and visual analog scale (VAS) pain score were recorded. Sacroplasty was performed under CT guidance. Follow-up CMS and VAS scores were assessed at 4, 24, and 48 weeks.Eighteen elderly patients (age 80 y Â± 8.5; 17 women) were treated. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to assess changes in CMS and VAS scores over time. Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant increase in average CMS score between baseline and all three follow-up points-4 weeks (P < .001), 24 weeks (P < .001), and 48 weeks (P < .001)-indicating improvement in mobility over time. Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences in mean VAS scores between baseline and all three follow-up time points-4 weeks (P < .001), 24 weeks (P < .001), and 48 weeks (P < .001)-indicating improvement in overall pain level over time.Treatment with CT-guided sacroplasty for sacral insufficiency fractures in this elderly population resulted in significant improvement in patient mobility.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713417","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bone scintigraphy","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_scintigraphy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.530912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.474091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.322769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.20626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Analog signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
