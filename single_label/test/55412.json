{"id":55412,"title":"Hyaluronidase injection for the treatment of eyelid edema: a retrospective analysis of 20 patients.","abstract":"Hyaluronidase (Hylase Dessau(®)) is a hyaluronic acid-metabolizing enzyme, which has been shown to loosen the extracellular matrix, thereby improving the diffusion of local anesthetics. Lower eyelid edema is a common post-interventional complication of cosmetic procedures performed in the lid region, such as the injection of hyaluronic acid fillers for tear-trough augmentation. The purpose of this study was to validate the efficacy of hyaluronidase in the management of lower eyelid edema.We performed a retrospective analysis with 20 patients with lower eyelid edema. Most patients (n = 14) presented with edema following hyaluronic acid injection (tear-trough augmentation), whereas the minority (n = 6) were treated due to idiopathic edema (malar edema or malar mounds). Patients were treated by local infiltration of approximately 0.2 ml to 0.5 ml of hyaluronidase (Hylase Dessau(®) 20 IU to 75 IU) per eyelid. Photographs were taken prior to and seven days after infiltration.Hyaluronidase was found to reduce effectively and rapidly or resolve eyelid edema after a single injection. No relevant adverse effects were observed. However, it must be noted that a hyaluronidase injection may also dissolve injected hyaluronic acid fillers and may therefore negatively affect tear-trough augmentations. While the effects of a treatment for edema due to tear-trough augmentation were permanent, malar edema and malar mounds reoccurred within two to three weeks.The infiltration of hyaluronidase is rapid, safe and currently the only effective option for the management of eyelid edema. No relevant adverse effects were observed.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886711","annotations":[{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.69007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.604821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.547593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Hyaluronidase","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronidase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.16009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cosmetic surgery","weight":0.117134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetic_surgery"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Dessau","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessau"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Augmentation of honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_of_honour"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Augmentation (psychiatry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"}]}
