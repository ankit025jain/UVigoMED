{"id":34826,"title":"[Atopic dermatitis severity and vitamin D concentration: a cross-sectional study].","abstract":"Contradictory findings have recently been published on the association between atopic dermatitis (AD) severity and vitamin D deficiency. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and AD severity.A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2011 to March 2013 in dermatology departments in adults and children with a diagnosis of AD. The severity of AD was assessed using the SCORAD and PO-SCORAD indexes and serum 25(OH)D concentrations were determined for all patients.Sixty patients were included: 30 with severe AD and 30 with mild-to-moderate AD. The 25(OH)D concentration was lower in patients with severe AD than in patients with mild-to-moderate AD (15.9 ± 8.3 ng/mL vs. 21.5 ± 8.2 ng/mL; P=0.01). There was a negative correlation between 25(OH)D concentration and respectively, SCORAD (r=-0.47; P<0.001) and PO-SCORAD (r=-0.4; P=0.004) values. The correlation between 25(OH)D concentrations and SCORAD values remained valid after adjustment for age, phototype and season.This study demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and AD severity but showed no causal link between these variables. Confounding variables such as sun exposure and socioeconomic status were not recorded. A large-sale, comparative interventional study could confirm a real link between these two variables.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703640","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.678478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.446866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.303016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.244929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Sunburn","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"15","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"}]}
