{"id":8539,"title":"Raptor gastroenterology.","abstract":"Free-living raptors are frequently presented to wildlife rehabilitation centers. Conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract can be the primary reason for presentation. The gastrointestinal tract can also be affected secondary to debilitation from other injuries or from the stress of the rehabilitation process. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and natural history of these species is crucial to successful treatment and rehabilitation. This article addresses raptor gastroenterology with an emphasis on conditions affecting free-living birds.
