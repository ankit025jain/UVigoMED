{"id":66742,"title":"Unravelling the prostate-specific antigen controversy: a West of Scotland perspective.","abstract":"The use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening tool for prostate cancer in asymptomatic men is hugely controversial in the light of randomised controlled trials failing to demonstrate a benefit without risk of significant overtreatment. However, PSA can be used as a tool to risk assess disease progression in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic enlargement (LUTS/BPE). The aim of this study was to canvas the opinions of West of Scotland Urologists regarding the use of PSA in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.A questionnaire-based survey was sent to all the Consultants and Trainees in the West of Scotland.Survey response rate was 45% (47/105). In patients <70 years, 93% would perform a PSA testing in patients symptomatic of LUTS/BPE, but only 17% would offer PSA screening to asymptomatic patients. In patients >70 years, only 48% of urologists would perform a PSA if patients were symptomatic and none would offer PSA screening. In terms of self-testing, 59% of urologists would have a PSA test if symptomatic and 31% of urologists would have PSA screening.This study highlights significant variability in the use of PSA for both asymptomatic and symptomatic men. Despite a lack of evidence, PSA screening is still offered to asymptomatic men. Further randomised studies are required to determine the utility of PSA-based screening algorithms for prostate cancer detection.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682103","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.147597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Scotland","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
