{"id":89741,"title":"Screw loosening and iliotibial band friction after posterolateral corner reconstruction.","abstract":"Many reconstruction techniques have already been developed for treating posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries, with still no consensus regarding what would be the best option. Some techniques use non-bone tunnel fixation, attaching the graft to the femur using a cortical screw with toothed washer. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate complications related to fixation performed by a screw and toothed washer technique.A prospective study with surgical reconstruction of the PLC structures of the knee between January 2008 and December 2009 was performed. PLC reconstruction included reconstruction of the lateral collateral ligament, popliteofibular ligament and popliteal muscle tendon. Fixation of the grafts in the femur was achieved by means of a 4.5mm screw with a toothed washer. The assessments were done using the following methods: objective IKDC, subjective IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner. Radiographic evaluations were performed immediately after the operation, at 3, 6 and 12months after surgery, and yearly thereafter. Complications were documented.The mean subjective IKDC score after the operation was 69.2; Lysholm scale was 80.7. Two patients presented failure of reconstructions of the PLC. In the radiographic evaluations, signs of loosening of the screw with toothed washer in the femur were observed in eight cases (66.6%). Six patients (50%) complained of lateral pain after the operation.The technique of femoral fixation was shown to be efficient in restoration of stability. However there was a high rate of complications secondary to implant, such as loosening of the screws and iliotibial tract friction.Case series, leve IV.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685057","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.869543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fibular collateral ligament","weight":0.813733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibular_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Popliteus muscle","weight":0.481686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteus_muscle"},{"name":"Iliotibial tract","weight":0.375271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_tract"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Interpretations of quantum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Washer (hardware)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washer_(hardware)"},{"name":"Intersex surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex_surgery"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Popliteal artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"}]}
