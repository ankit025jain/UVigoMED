{"id":62973,"title":"No impact of total or myeloid Cd34+ cell numbers on neutrophil engraftment and transplantation-related mortality after allogeneic pediatric bone marrow transplantation.","abstract":"Although the influence of transplanted bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells on neutrophil engraftment (NE) and transplantation outcomes has been discussed controversially, thresholds between 2 and 4 × 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells are commonly accepted. This has substantial consequences for a donor in terms of BM volume to be collected, which frequently covers up to 15 to 20 mL/kg. As the BM CD34+ compartment contains varying fractions of CD34+/CD19+ B lymphoid progenitors, we tested the hypothesis that the infused CD34+/CD45dim/CD19-/CD10- myeloid stem cells might reliably predict NE in 94 children who received BM from 37 HLA-identical sibling donors (MSD) and 57 matched unrelated donors after myeloablative conditioning. The grafts contained a median of 3.6 × 10(6)/kg total CD34+ cells, which consisted of a median of 73% myeloid CD34+ cells and 27% B lymphoid progenitors. Grafts from donors <15 years old yielded significantly lower myeloid fractions compared with grafts from older donors (P < .001). All patients achieved sustained NE after median 20 (range, 11 to 40) days. By multivariate analysis, neither the number of total CD34+ cells (P = .605) nor of myeloid CD34+ cells (P = .981) correlated with NE, whereas transplantation from MSD (hazard ratio [HR] 3.51; P = .019) and the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (HR 2.24; P = .002) remained independent factors associated with earlier NE. Furthermore, neither total nor myeloid CD34+ cell quantities were associated with incidences of severe infections before NE (P = .271 and P = .132) or transplantation-related mortality (TRM) at day +100 (P = .294 and P = .490). Taking into account that the number of transplanted total CD34+ or myeloid CD34+ cells does not seem to have a relevant impact on time to NE, sepsis rates, or TRM, the need of certain threshold cell numbers should be revisited, at least for pediatric MSD.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492145","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.718951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.587928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.412146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.37066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.3187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.260458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Neprilysin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neprilysin"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cadmium","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Sibling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling"}]}
