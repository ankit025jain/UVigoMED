{"id":65422,"title":"Prostate cancer molecular detection in plasma samples by glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) methylation analysis.","abstract":"Prostate cancer (PCa) represents the most commonly diagnosed type of malignancy among men in Western European countries and the second cause of cancer-related deaths among men worldwide. Methylation of the CpG island has an important role in prostate carcinogenesis and progression. The purpose of the study was to analyse the diagnostic value of aberrant promoter hypermethylation of the gene for glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) in plasma DNA to discriminate between prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients by minimally invasive methods.Aberrant promoter hypermethylation was investigated in DNA isolated from plasma samples of 31 patients with diagnostic of PCa and 44 cancer-free males (control subjects). Extracted genomic DNA was bisulfite treated and analyzed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) technique.Hypermethylation of the GSTP1 gene was detected in plasma samples from 27 of 31 (92.86%) patients with PCa. Genomic DNA from plasma samples from the 44 controls without genitourinary cancer revealed promoter hypermethylation of GSTP1 gene in 3 (10.6%) of the 44 patients. Receiver operating curve (ROC) included clinico-pathological parameters such as: serum PSA levels, pathological stage, Gleason score, hypermethylation status of GSTP1 gene, and it gave a predictive accuracy of 93% with a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 87%, respectively.In this study, we have evaluated the ability of GSTP1 gene to discriminate between PCa and BPH patients in genomic DNA from plasma samples by non-invasive methods.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839830","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.872009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"CpG island","weight":0.78837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.755154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.6919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.640434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.636569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.583966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.57573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.450612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.1027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"GSTP1","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSTP1"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bisulfite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
