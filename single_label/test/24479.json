{"id":24479,"title":"[Changes of Th1/Th2 cytokines in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis].","abstract":"To study the changes of Th1/Th2 cytokines in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC).Twenty immunocompetent patients with PC were identified by histopathological examination and enrolled along with the age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The serum concentrations of interferon-? (IFN-?), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in both groups were isolated and incubated with or without recombinant human IL-12 (rhIL-12) for 48 hours, and the concentrations of IFN-? and IL-4 in the supernatant were measured by ELISA.(1) Serum IFN-? levels were significantly decreased in the patients compared with the control group [(14.5 ± 2.7) vs (81.8 ± 9.8) ng/L (t = 6.590, P < 0.01)], while no significant difference was observed in serum IL-12 and IL-4 levels [(2.5 ± 0.5) vs (2.52 ± 0.6) ng/L and (6.9 ± 1.3) vs (7.3 ± 1.5) ng/L, (t = 0.0035 and 0.2136, P > 0.05) ]. (2) The concentrations of IFN-? and IL-4 in the supernatant of PBMC without rhIL-12 stimulation showed no differences between the 2 groups [(55.7 ± 13.6) vs (51.1 ± 17.5) ng/L and (5.1 ± 0.7) vs (5.0 ± 0.6) ng/L (t = 0.2979 and 0.0325, P > 0.05) ]. (3) Treatment with rhIL-12 stimulated the release of IFN-?, but the increase in the patients [(4.3 ± 0.5) folds] was less compared with that in the controls [(7.9 ± 1.1) folds] (t = 3.01, P < 0.01) , while IL-4 concentration in the supernatant of PBMC was not increased in both groups[ (0.9 ± 0.4) vs (1.3 ± 0.4) folds (t = 0.7240, P > 0.05) ].Serum Th1 cytokine (IFN-?) levels may be dampened in immunocompetent patients with PC, without significant change in serum levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-4). Deficiency in the response to IL-12 stimulation of Th1 cells may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the decline in serum IFN-? levels.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433803","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.846751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cryptococcosis","weight":0.707151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcosis"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.662786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.634977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.412295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"}]}
