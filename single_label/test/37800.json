{"id":37800,"title":"MRI hydrographic 3D sequences in CADASIL.","abstract":"Two patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) (figure), evolving with cognitive deterioration, had MRI. Hydrographic 3D high-resolution turbo spin-echo (TSE) with variable flip angle sequence (SPACE) was performed to demonstrate the subcortical lacunar lesions (SLL) (figure, A and B), considered specific in CADASIL.(1.)
