{"id":90666,"title":"The effects of intracranial pressure monitoring in patients with traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"Although international guideline recommended routine intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for patients with severe traumatic brain injury(TBI), there were conflicting outcomes attributable to ICP monitoring according to the published studies. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICP monitoring in patients with TBI.Based on previous reviews, PubMed and two Chinese databases (Wangfang and VIP) were further searched to identify eligible studies. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included unfavourable outcome, adverse events, length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay. Weighted mean difference (WMD), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled using fixed-effects or random-effects model.two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven cohort studies involving 11,038 patients met the inclusion criteria. ICP monitoring was not associated with a significant reduction in mortality (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.87-1.54), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2)?= 80%, P<0.00001), which was verified by the sensitivity analyses. No significant difference was found in the occurrence of unfavourable outcome (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.99-1.98; I(2)?= 4%, P = 0.35) and adverse events (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.64-1.70; I(2)?= 78%, P = 0.03). However, we should be cautious to the result of adverse events because of the substantial heterogeneity in the comparison. Furthermore, longer ICU and hospital stay were the consistent tendency according to the pooled studies.No benefit was found in patients with TBI who underwent ICP monitoring. Considering substantial clinical heterogeneity, further large sample size RCTs are needed to confirm the current findings.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586276","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.867078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.636573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.604945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.565191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.379825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.361242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.248859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.240812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0589687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
