{"id":87609,"title":"The impacts of injury at the individual, community and societal levels: a systematic meta-review.","abstract":"Injury is a major public health problem. While the impacts of injury on the injured person are well documented, there is relatively little knowledge about the impacts of injury on those individuals and groups in the community connected to the injured person. This study seeks to describe this breadth of research using a meta-review methodology.Systematic meta-review.To gain a better understanding of the known impacts of injury on family, community and society, a systematic meta-review of injury outcomes research literature was conducted. Seventy-eight peer-reviewed published literature reviews were included in the meta-review.Of these, 70 reported outcomes at the level of the injured person including mortality, body functions, activity and participation limitations. Nine reviews reported impacts at the level of the community including impacts on family members, work colleagues and carers. Six studies reported impacts at the societal level including economic, health system and injury compensation system impacts.In summary, the meta-review identified a substantial body of knowledge at the individual level outcomes of injury, and a relative lack of information regarding the community and societal impacts of injury. An injury outcome framework is proposed on the basis of the findings of the meta-review to guide future research activity, particularly with regard to injury outcome domains where there is currently limited evidence. A comprehensive framework that takes account of all levels of impact is necessary for effective policies, systems and strategies to support recovery following injury.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065515","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.668233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.449287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review"},{"name":"Outcomes research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcomes_research"},{"name":"Nine Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Network"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Body of Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_Knowledge"},{"name":"Climate change, industry and society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change,_industry_and_society"}]}
