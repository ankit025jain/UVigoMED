{"id":76723,"title":"Vitamin D status and its determinants in children and adults among families in late summer in Denmark.","abstract":"The impact of the familial relationship on vitamin D status has not been investigated previously. The objective of the present cross-sectional study was to assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and its determinants in children and adults among families in late summer in Denmark (56°N). Data obtained from 755 apparently healthy children (4-17 years) and adults (18-60 years) recruited as families (n 200) in the VitmaD study were analysed. Blood samples were collected in September-October, and serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Information on potential determinants was obtained using questionnaires. The geometric mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 72·1 (interquartile range 61·5-86·7) nmol/l (range 9-162 nmol/l), with 9 % of the subjects having 25(OH)D concentrations < 50 nmol/l. The intra-family correlation was 0·27 in all subjects, 0·24 in the adults and 0·42 in the children. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was negatively associated with BMI (P< 0·001) and positively associated with dietary vitamin D intake (P= 0·008), multivitamin use (P= 0·019), solarium use (P= 0·006), outdoor stay (P= 0·001), sun preference (P= 0·002) and sun vacation (P< 0·001), but was not associated with lifestyle-related factors in the adults when these were assessed together with the other determinants. In conclusion, the majority of children and adults among the families had serum 25(OH)D concentrations >50 nmol/l in late summer in Denmark. Both dietary and sun-related factors were determinants of vitamin D status and the familial component was stronger for the children than for the adults.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24932732","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.442787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Geometric mean","weight":0.404351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.36104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.284345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Multivitamin","weight":0.280448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.278011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.271369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.191867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.154115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.0574438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"1860","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860"},{"name":"755","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/755"},{"name":"721","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/721"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Cousin chart","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_chart"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
