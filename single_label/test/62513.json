{"id":62513,"title":"BIM upregulation and ROS-dependent necroptosis mediate the antitumor effects of the HDACi Givinostat and Sorafenib in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line xenografts.","abstract":"Relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is an unmet medical need requiring new therapeutic options. Interactions between the histone deacetylase inhibitor Givinostat and the RAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor Sorafenib were examined in HDLM-2 and L-540 HL cell lines. Exposure to Givinostat/Sorafenib induced a synergistic inhibition of cell growth (range, 70-80%) and a marked increase in cell death (up to 96%) due to increased H3 and H4 acetylation and strong mitochondrial injury. Gene expression profiling indicated that the synergistic effects of Givinostat/Sorafenib treatment are associated with the modulation of cell cycle and cell death pathways. Exposure to Givinostat/Sorafenib resulted in sustained production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of necroptotic cell death. The necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1 prevented Givinostat/Sorafenib-induced ROS production, mitochondrial injury, activation of BH3-only protein BIM and cell death. Knockdown experiments identified BIM as a key signaling molecule that mediates Givinostat/Sorafenib-induced oxidative death of HL cells. Furthermore, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated a 50% reduction in tumor burden (P<0.0001), a 5- to 15-fold increase in BIM expression (P < 0.0001) and a fourfold increase in tumor necrosis in Givinostat/Sorafenib-treated animals compared with mice that received single agents. These results provide a rationale for exploring Givinostat/Sorafenib combination in relapsed/refractory HL.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561519","annotations":[{"name":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.823983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Histone deacetylase","weight":0.808201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.80644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.799402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.668748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.666368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.627521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.535822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.531511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Histone H3","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H3"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
