{"id":53964,"title":"The effect of hypoglycemia on health-related quality of life: Canadian results from a multinational time trade-off survey.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of hypoglycemia according to severity and time of onset on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a Canadian population.Time trade-off (TTO) methodology was used to estimate health utilities associated with hypoglycemic events in a representative sample of the Canadian population. A global analysis conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Sweden has been published. The present Canadian analysis focuses on 3 populations: general, type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Using a web-based survey, participants (>18 years) assessed the utility of 13 different health states (severe, non-severe, daytime and nocturnal hypoglycemia at different frequencies) using a scale from 1 (perfect health) to 0 (death). The average disutility value for each type of event was calculated.Of 2258 participants, 1696 completers were included in the analysis. A non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemic event was associated with a significantly greater disutility than a non-severe daytime event (-0.0076 vs. -0.0056, respectively; p=0.05), while there was no statistically significant difference between severe nocturnal and severe daytime events (-0.0616 vs. -0.0592; p=0.76). Severe hypoglycemia was associated with greater disutility than non-severe hypoglycemia (p<0.0001). Similar trends were reported in participants with diabetes.The findings presented here show that any form of hypoglycemia had a negative impact on HRQoL in a Canadian population. Nocturnal and/or severe hypoglycemia had a greater negative impact on HRQoL compared with daytime and/or non-severe events. This highlights the importance of preventing the development and nocturnal manifestation of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485213","annotations":[{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.774299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.668553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.615908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.565021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.530556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.446303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.203825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Public utility","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Differential geometry","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Daytime television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_television"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Trade-off","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
