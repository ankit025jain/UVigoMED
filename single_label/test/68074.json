{"id":68074,"title":"[Botulinum A toxin and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia: retrospective study of 47 patients].","abstract":"To assess the efficacy of injections of botulinum toxin type A (BT-A) in the urethral sphincter for treating detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD).Retrospective observational study of patients with confirmed urodynamic DSD (neurological and non-neurological etiologies) treated at our center from 2002 to 2010. All patients received 300 IU of DYSPORTÂ® injected transperineally under electromyographic control. Using a visual analog scale (VAS) for mictional disorders and the measure of the post-void residual (PVR) as criteria of efficacy, results were classified as \"non-satisfactory\" (decrease in the VAS<2 or decrease in the PVR<20%), \"intermediate\" (decrease in the VAS?2 or decrease in the PVR?20%) or \"satisfactory\" (decrease in the VAS>3 or decrease in the PVR>40%).Records of 47 patients (7 women and 40 men) were studied. Mean follow-up was 14.2 months. At the end of follow-up, there were 23.4% (11) of \"satisfactory\" results, 19.1% (9) of \"intermediate\" results, 42.6% (20) of \"non-satisfactory\" results and 14.9% (7) of patients lost for follow-up. The mean decrease in PVR was 60 mL (from an average of 212 to an average of 152 mL). No side effect was observed.In this small series reporting the results of the injection of BT-A in the urethral sphincter for DSD, we observed 42.5% of satisfactory or intermediate results without associated side effects.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560292","annotations":[{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.686781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.515945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Botulinum toxin","weight":0.437234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.290105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.179322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.147506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Digital video recorder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Bladder sphincter dyssynergia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_sphincter_dyssynergia"},{"name":"Urethral sphincter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_sphincter"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Detrusor urinae muscle","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrusor_urinae_muscle"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Bulgarian News Agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_News_Agency"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Direct Stream Digital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Stream_Digital"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
