{"id":30468,"title":"Incidence of unlicensed and off-label prescription in children.","abstract":"Many common drugs have not been licensed for use in children.This study evaluated the incidence of unlicensed and off-label prescriptions at the Department of Pediatrics during a period of six months. A total of 8,559 prescriptions for 4,282 children were processed.Off-label and unlicensed prescriptions were found in 9.01% and 1.26% of all prescriptions, respectively. Unlicensed prescriptions were significantly more common in boys (1.5%) than in girls (1.0%) (p?=?0.037). There was no significant difference between off-label prescriptions in boys (9.0%) and in girls (9.1%) (p?=?0.89). The prescription of unlicensed drugs was significantly more frequent in school age children (p?<?0.0001). The most commonly prescribed unlicensed drugs were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; among off-label drugs, antihistamines and bronchodilators.This study shows that the incidence of unlicensed and off-label drug prescriptions in our patients is not as high as in other studies.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495454","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Histamine antagonist","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_antagonist"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bronchodilator","weight":0.324313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchodilator"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"License","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"The Strip (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strip_(The_O.C.)"}]}
