{"id":19774,"title":"Heterologous protection against alpha toxins of Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus induced by binding domain recombinant chimeric protein.","abstract":"Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus are the two important bacteria frequently associated with majority of the soft tissue infections. The severity and progression of the diseases caused by these pathogens are attributed primarily to the alpha toxins they produce. Previously, we synthesized a non-toxic chimeric molecule r-?CS encompassing the binding domains of C. perfringens and S. aureus alpha toxins and demonstrated that the r-?CS hyperimmune polysera reacts with both the native wild type toxins. In the present report, we evaluated efficacy of r-?CS in conferring protection against C. perfringens and S. aureus alpha toxin infections in murine model. Immunization of BALB/c with r-?CS was effective in inducing both high titers of serum anti-r-?CS antibodies after three administrations. Sub-typing the antibody pool revealed high proportions of IgG1 indicating a Th2-polarized immune response. The r-?CS stimulated the proliferation of splenocytes from the immunized mice upon re-induction by the antigen, in vitro. The levels of interleukin-10 increased while TNF-? was found to be downregulated in the r-?CS induced splenocytes. Mice immunized with r-?CS were protected against intramuscular challenge with 5Ã—LD100 doses of C. perfringens and S. aureus alpha toxins with >80% survival, which killed control animals within 48-72h. Passive immunization of mice with anti-r-?CS serum resulted in 50-80% survival. Our results indicate that r-?CS is a remarkable antigen with protective efficacy against alpha toxin mediated C. perfringens and S. aureus soft tissue co-infections.
