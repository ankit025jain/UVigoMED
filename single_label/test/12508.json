{"id":12508,"title":"Mouse models of glioblastoma: lessons learned and questions to be answered.","abstract":"Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumour in adults. While many patients achieve disease remission following treatment with surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, this remission is brief and invariably followed by tumour recurrence and progression. Recent work using mouse models of the disease, coupled with data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas, have given us new insights into the mechanisms that underlie gliomagenesis and result in glioblastoma heterogeneity. These findings suggest that the treatment of glioblastoma will require a more nuanced understanding of their biology and the employment of targeted therapeutic approaches. In this review, we will summarize the current state of mouse modeling in glioma, with a focus on how these models may inform our understanding of this disease and its treatment.
