{"id":83692,"title":"[Study on protective effect of total saponins of Panax japonicus on LPS-induced RAW264. 7 cell inflammation through NF-kappaB pathway].","abstract":"To observe the anti-inflammatory effect of total saponins of Panax japonicus on LPS-induced RAW264. 7 macrophages.The effect of total saponins of P. japonicus of different concentrations on RAW264. 7 cell viability was determined with the MTT method. The NO kit assay was adopted to detect the NO release of total saponins of P. japonicus to LPS-induced RAW264. 7 cells. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta). The reverse transeriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) ,TNF-alpha,IL-1beta. The protein expression of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB p65 (NF-kappaB p65) was tested by Western blot.The safe medication range of total saponins of P. japonicus was less than 80 mg x L(-1). Compared with the LPS model group, total saponins of P. japonicus high, middle and low dose groups (0.1, 1, 10, 40 mg x L(-1)) could significantly reduce the secretion of NO, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta of LPS-induced RAW264. 7 cells, and inhibit the expressions of iNOS, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA and the protein expression of NF-kappaB p65.This study preliminarily proves the protective effect of total saponins of P. japonicus on LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. Its action mechanism may be related to NF-kappaB signal pathway.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272846","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.858123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.675831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.536922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.53395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Ginseng","weight":0.523914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginseng"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.429552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.414458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.252547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.158606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
