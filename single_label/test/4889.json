{"id":4889,"title":"[Sequencing and analysis of N gene of street rabies virus isolated from different hosts in Zhejiang province].","abstract":"To elucidate the characteristics of genetic variability and its relationship with prevalence, through sequencing and analysis of N gene among street rabies virus isolated from different hosts (homo sapiens, ferret badger, dog) in Zhejiang province.Samples were screened and confirmed by direct fluorescence assay and reverse transcript PCR. Sequences were analyzed using bio-information software.Eighteen street rabies virus strains were identified, including 2 from homo sapiens, 5 from ferret badger, and 11 from dog. Similarities of N gene and N protein were calculated to be 89.7%-100.0% and 98.4%-100.0% respectively. Mutations occurred in N gene were almost non-sense mutations. In addition,Data from phylogenetic analysis showed that all these strains could be classified into traditional genotype 1.The prevalence of rabies viruses among different hosts in Zhejiang province had certain regional properties. Rabies viruses isolated from the same kind of host or from the same/adjacent county/counties had the closest relationship. However, the characteristics of rabies virus prevalent in homo sapiens were somewhat complicated. In summary, the transmission of street rabies virus in Zhejiang province was from dogs to ferret badgers and homo sapiens, and the virus could circulate and cross-regional transmit among dogs and ferret badgers.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294078","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Rabies","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.721734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.715286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.635174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.624967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Ferret","weight":0.614154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.555951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Badger","weight":0.510886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badger"},{"name":"Nonsense mutation","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_mutation"},{"name":"Rabies virus","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_virus"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.260136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.219056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Genetic variability","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variability"},{"name":"Zhejiang","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang"},{"name":"Homosexuality","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Nonsense","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense"}]}
