{"id":32467,"title":"[Port-wine stains treated by pulsed-dye laser with sedation: A retrospective observational efficacy and safety in 18 children].","abstract":"Pulsed-dye laser (PDL) is the gold standard treatment for port-wine stains but it is painful. To limit pain in small children, sedation may be given.We sought to determine the efficacy of this approach and the risks of sedation, as well as the level of satisfaction of parents.A retrospective study was conducted in our dermatology department in children treated with PDL while under sedation. The efficacy of treatment was evaluated by comparing pictures of lesions before and after treatment and using a questionnaire sent to the parents.18 children were included between 2003 and 2011. In all, 111 laser sessions were performed with sedation. Comparison of photographs showed an improvement rate of 6.2/10 (in terms of colour and area). The mean parent satisfaction score was 6.6/10. Adverse events were reported in 27.8 % of children and for 4.5 % of PDL sessions, with one case of severe hypoxemia that resolved without sequelae.In our study, PDL for port-wine stains was effective, with good improvement of lesions. Pain was controlled thanks to sedation with one serious adverse event. The parents indicated a positive impression. This study suggests that the procedure may be proposed for small children in order to reduce pain, with a good risk-benefit ratio for sedation. More studies are needed to better qualify pain management for children under PDL treatment.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951140","annotations":[{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.910008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.386649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.238933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.0574438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Serious adverse event","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_adverse_event"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"USL Premier Development League","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USL_Premier_Development_League"}]}
