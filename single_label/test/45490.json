{"id":45490,"title":"[Surgical treatment for cervicothoracic esophageal carcinoma with tracheal involvement].","abstract":"To evaluate the surgical treatment and outcome of cervicothoracic esophageal carcinoma with tracheal.Ten cases of cervicothoracic esophageal carcinoma with tracheal invasion underwent surgical treatment between 2004 and 2011 was reviewed. Operative methods, complications, pathology, and prognosis were analyzed.The patients were divided into 2 groups, 5 patients with cervical tracheal invasion group and 5 patients with cervicothoracic tracheal invasion. Thoracotomy and anterior mediastinal tracheostomy (AMT) were required for 5 patients with cervicothoracic tracheal invasion. The median follow-up was 23 months (ranging from 6 to 76 months). Of 5 patients with cervical tracheal invasion, 3 patients survived with free of disease for more than 5 years postoperatively, 1 patient died of local recurrence at 14 months postoperatively, and 1 patient died of cardiac infarction at 26 months postoperatively. Among 5 patients with cervicothoracic tracheal invasion, 2 patients died during hospitalization, and 1 patient died of local recurrence at 16 months postoperatively, and 2 patients died of distant metastasis at 6 and 20 months after surgery respectively.Tracheal invasion is not a contraindication to radical operation for the cervicothoracic esophageal carcinoma. Surgical treatment has a good outcome in cervicothoracic esophageal carcinoma with only cervical tracheal invasion. If thoracic trachea is involved, especially when the length of the distal trachea is less than 5 cm, operation should be performed with caution.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680334","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.814652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.737012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.632123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.492364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.263268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.115245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0478281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"}]}
