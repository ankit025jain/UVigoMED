{"id":2428,"title":"Cumulative incidence of second intestinal resection in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies.","abstract":"Approximately 50% of Crohn's disease patients undergo an intestinal resection within 10 years of diagnosis. The risk of second surgery in Crohn's disease and the influence of time are not well characterized. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the risk of second abdominal surgery in patients with Crohn's disease among patients who had a previous surgery.We searched Medline, EMBASE, PubMed (March 2014), and conference proceedings for terms related to Crohn's disease and intestinal surgery. We included population-based articles (n=11) and an abstract (n=1) reporting surgical risk for the overall study period and for 5 and 10 years after the first surgery for Crohn's disease. We stratified studies by year (start year before vs. after 1980) to explore the role of time.For all population-based studies, the overall risk of second surgery was 28.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22.6-36.6%). The 5-year risk of second surgery was 24.2% (95% CI: 22.3-26.4%). The 10-year risk of second surgery was 35.0% (95% CI: 31.8-38.6%). A significant difference in the 10-year risk of second surgery was observed over time such that studies conducted after 1980 had a lower risk of second surgery (33.2%; 95% CI: 31.2-35.4%) compared with those that started before 1980 (44.6%; 95% CI: 37.7-52.7%).Approximately one-quarter of Crohn's disease patients who have a first surgery also have a second, and the majority of these surgeries occur within 5 years of the first surgery. The 10-year risk of second surgery is significantly decreasing over time.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25331349","annotations":[{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.747629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.735636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.500956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"636","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/636"},{"name":"235","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/235"},{"name":"838","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/838"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Proceedings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"}]}
