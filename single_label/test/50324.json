{"id":50324,"title":"[Effect of byetta on renal osmoregulatory function in patients with diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"The renal osmoregulatory function was studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The renal response to water loading (0.7% b.w.) and simultaneous exenatide (byetta) injection (5 microg) exhibited variation and was dependent on the degree of hyperglycemia. Effective solute-free water excretion was observed in patients with well-controlled DM (HbAlc 6.0 +/- 0.1%), in which CH20 changed from -0.67 +/- 0.2 mL/min to 0.72 +/- 0.2 mL/min. This reaction was absent in patients with poorly controlled DM (HbAlc 8.8 +/- 0.6%) and the process of solute-free water reabsorption prevailed: -CH20 = -1.06 +/- 0.1 mL/min in control period vs. -0.99 +/- 0.1 mL/min after treatment. Thus, byetta increases the efficiency of osmoregulation and accelerates the excretion of excess water in patients with compensated carbohydrate metabolism.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800522","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.730789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Exenatide","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exenatide"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Osmoregulation","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmoregulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.215878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Reabsorption","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reabsorption"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"W","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Order of the Companions of Honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
