{"id":20648,"title":"In vitro activity and post-antibiotic effects of colistin in combination with other antimicrobials against colistin-resistant KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream isolates.","abstract":"Combination therapy is recommended for the treatment of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp), but the optimal regimen for colistin-resistant strains is unknown. We compared the synergistic activity and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of colistin in combination with other antimicrobials against colistin-susceptible and -resistant KPC-Kp bloodstream isolates.The genotypes of nine colistin-susceptible and eight colistin-resistant KPC-Kp bloodstream isolates were analysed using PCR and amplicon sequencing. Combinations of colistin, meropenem, tigecycline, rifampicin and teicoplanin were then screened using the Etest, a chequerboard assay and time-kill studies. Synergistic combinations were also analysed with respect to the PAE in time-kill curves and the PAE at clinically achievable concentrations.Insertional inactivation of the PhoQ/PhoB two-component regulatory system by mgrB-IS5 was identified in 6/8 (75%) colistin-resistant KPC-Kp. Colistin/rifampicin combinations resulted in no interactions [fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices 1.5-2] for colistin-susceptible strains, but were uniformly synergistic (FIC indices 0.1-0.4) against colistin-resistant KPC-Kp. Time-kill kinetic analysis, at clinically achievable fixed concentrations of rifampicin and colistin, confirmed synergy and produced persistent growth inhibition (3 h) of colistin-resistant KPC-Kp strains exposed to colistin/rifampicin or colistin/rifampicin/tigecycline combinations.Combinations of colistin plus rifampicin, and less frequently tigecycline, exhibited synergistic activity in vitro against colistin-resistant KPC-Kp strains.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648503","annotations":[{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.420466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.417124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Teicoplanin","weight":0.321569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teicoplanin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.19349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Colistin","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Tigecycline","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigecycline"},{"name":"Amplicon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplicon"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Checkerboard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Imperial College London","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London"},{"name":"Physical Address Extension","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
