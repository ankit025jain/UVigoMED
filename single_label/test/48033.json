{"id":48033,"title":"Prevalence and interannual changes in multiple chemical sensitivity in Japanese workers.","abstract":"We aimed to evaluate the prevalence rates and interannual fluctuations in multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) in Japanese workers.We assessed MCS using the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory, employing both Miller and Japanese criteria. Workers of two manufacturing companies located in Kyushu, Japan, were assessed, with company A surveyed in 2003, 2006 and 2011, and company B in 2003 and 2011.In company A, the Miller criteria-based MCS prevalence rate was higher in 2011 than in 2003, and according to the Japanese criteria, it was higher in 2011 than 2006. In company B, the Miller criteria-based MCS prevalence rate was lower in 2011 than in 2003.The results indicated that MCS exists among industrial workers in Japan. We found no statistically significant interannual changes in MCS rates.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Disorders of Environmental Origin","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477857","annotations":[{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.634561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.605358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.305614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.130071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Multiple chemical sensitivity","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Bavaria state election, 2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria_state_election,_2003"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Kyushu","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu"}]}
