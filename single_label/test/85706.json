{"id":85706,"title":"Promoting long-term benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation: the role of reducing the impact of respiratory exacerbations.","abstract":"The importance of exercise for pulmonary patients is unquestioned. Decreased functional status has been attributed to increased hospitalizations, leading to further decreases in functionality, decreased quality of life and increased mortality. Despite known benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation, recruitment and retention of program participants can be a challenge. Alternatives to traditional pulmonary rehabilitation are reviewed with an emphasis on physical activity, exacerbation awareness and a reduction in hospital admissions.
