{"id":88065,"title":"Using a triggered endocrinology service consultation to improve the evaluation, management, and follow-up of osteoporosis in hip-fracture patients.","abstract":"Nearly 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur yearly in the United States, with more than 400,000 requiring hospital admissions. Fewer than 30% receive proper evaluation and care for osteoporosis, representing a large opportunity to enhance secondary prevention of fractures. Methods to improve identification and triage of hospitalized fragility-fracture patients are desirable.A multidisciplinary team was created, and definitions were established for an evidence-based best-practice protocol to assess, treat, and document an osteoporosis diagnosis and triage patients with hip-fragility fractures on the basis of the best-practice recommendations from The Joint Commission and the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The team initiated a preauthorized osteoporosis consultation from the endocrinology service for hip-fracture patients, \"triggered\" via a brief query in admission orders or by the orthopedic service nurse practitioner. Osteoporosis consultations used a consultation template reflecting the protocol.Data were analyzed for 71 baseline patients and 61 intervention patients. The groups possessed similar age, gender, race, and body mass index characteristics. The baseline (on-demand consultation) group suffered from poor performance, with only 3%-21% of patients receiving the desired evaluation, documentation, treatment, or outpatient follow-up. Intervention (triggered-consultation) patients improved markedly postintervention, With performance increasing by 52%-76% on all parameters except outpatient follow-up, which changed insignificantly (6%-15%).Although triggered consultation was effective, multimodal layered interventions may achieve even better results and address several identified barriers.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919254","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.766577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.572247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Nurse practitioner","weight":0.486382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_practitioner"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.348327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Joint Commission","weight":0.221729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Commission"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.216396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.101841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Demonic possession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Authorization hold","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_hold"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"The Joint (music venue)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joint_(music_venue)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
