{"id":76809,"title":"Three months of regular aerobic exercise in patients with obesity improve systemic subclinical inflammation without major influence on blood pressure and endocrine production of subcutaneous fat.","abstract":"The aim of our study was to explore the effects of regular aerobic exercise on anthropometric, biochemical and hormonal parameters and mRNA expression of selected factors involved in metabolic regulations in subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients with obesity. Fifteen obese women with arterial hypertension underwent a three-month exercise program consisting of 30 min of aerobic exercise 3 times a week. Fifteen healthy lean women with no intervention served as a control group. Obese group underwent anthropometric measurements, blood sampling, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) biopsy and 24-h blood pressure monitoring at baseline and after three months of exercise, while control group was examined only once. At baseline, obese group had increased SCAT expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines relative to control group. Three months of regular exercise improved anthropometric parameters, decreased CRP, blood glucose and HOMA-IR, while having no significant effect on lipid profile and blood pressure. Gene expressions in SCAT were not affected by physical activity with the exception of increased aquaporin-3 mRNA expression. We conclude that three months of regular exercise decrease systemic subclinical inflammation with only minor influence on the blood pressure and the endocrine function of subcutaneous fat.
