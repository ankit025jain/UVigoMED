{"id":78839,"title":"Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair genes with laryngeal cancer risk and interaction with cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking.","abstract":"We investigated the potential association of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes with risk of laryngeal cancer. A ratio of 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted. Conditional regression analysis indicated that subjects with ERCC1 rs11615 CC and C allele had an increased risk of laryngeal cancer compared with the TT genotype. Individuals with the ERCC5 rs17655 GG and G allele had a moderately increased risk of laryngeal cancer when compared with the CC genotype. By stratified analysis, ERCC1 rs11615 CC genotype and C allele were significantly associated with greatly increased risk of laryngeal cancer in ever smokers. ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC5 rs17655 polymorphisms were associated with a moderately increased risk of this cancer in ever drinkers. In summary, we suggest that genetic variations in ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC5 rs17655 are associated with laryngeal cancer risk in a Chinese population, especially in ever smokers and drinkers. Our finding could be helpful in identifying people at high risk for the disease for early intervention.
