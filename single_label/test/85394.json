{"id":85394,"title":"Lung biopsy for chronic pulmonary disease in children.","abstract":"Lung biopsy is frequently used in the management of children with chronic pulmonary disease to obtain a histological diagnosis. We further evaluate the role of lung biopsy by reviewing our experience of this procedure.A retrospective case-note review was carried out of all patients in our regional service under 16 years who underwent a lung biopsy from 1998 to 2011.Thirty-three children (12 boys) (median 5 years 5 months, range 2 months to 16 years) underwent lung biopsy in the period studied. Following the procedure, 17 patients required ventilation on the intensive care unit for a median of two days (range 1-56 days). Complication rate was 30% (10/33); seven simple pneumothoraces, one tension pneumothorax, and one pneumonia (one child experienced more than one complication). The operative mortality was 12% (4/33). Three children (9%) died within 28 days of surgery. Twenty-six (79%) biopsies provided a definitive histological diagnosis. In 16 (48%) children, the working diagnosis and treatment were changed following lung biopsy.Lung biopsy has an important role in the management of children with chronic pulmonary disease. However, it carries significant risks which must be considered when assessing the need for histological diagnosis.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24952791","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.774202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.18364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
