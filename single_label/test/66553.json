{"id":66553,"title":"Prognostic impact of intraductal carcinoma and large cribriform carcinoma architecture after prostatectomy in a contemporary cohort.","abstract":"Intraductal carcinoma (IDC) of prostate is a distinct entity associated with higher Gleason score and poor prognosis. The prognostic significance of large cribriform Gleason pattern 4 (LC) in conjunction with IDC has not been previously investigated. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of IDC and LC on biochemical recurrence-free rate (bRFR) in a contemporary prostatectomy cohort.Prostate cancers of 246 prostatectomies, median follow-up 130.6 months, were graded with the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2005 modified Gleason score (GS) and assessed for the presence of LC and/or IDC. In 57 cases with LC and/or IDC, immunostaining was performed to distinguish LC and IDC. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate 5-year bRFR probabilities. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of any amount of LC or IDC had a highly significant prognostic effect on bRFR (HR 2.98, 95% CI: 1.68-5.28, p=0.0002) after adjusting for GS, surgical margin status and pathological stage. Although IDC alone tended to be associated with a worse prognosis, LC and IDC did not appear to be associated with a difference in bRFR when analysed separately.We demonstrate that the presence of any amount of LC/IDC is a significant prognostic factor after adjusting for Gleason score and T stage in determining patient outcome and we advocate including the presence of either in routine pathology reporting.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703897","annotations":[{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.818902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgical margin","weight":0.642943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_margin"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.595181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.257943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.140536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"ISDN User Part","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN_User_Part"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Home run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"685","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/685"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Kilometre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Lactiferous duct","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactiferous_duct"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Advocate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"}]}
