{"id":87888,"title":"Subaquatic reaming during arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint to prevent thermal necrosis of bone.","abstract":"When performing fusions of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, it has been hypothesized that the use of a cup and cone reamer may cause thermal necrosis, leading to potential nonunion. The friction created by the reamer spinning against the bone has been shown to cause elevations of temperatures capable of causing thermal necrosis. Failing to cool the bony-reamer interface, or doing so inadequately with a bulb syringe, increases the patient's odds of experiencing a nonunion. The authors describe a simple technique that prevents significant temperature elevations at the reamer-bony interface, decreasing the potential for thermal necrosis and increasing the likelihood of successful fusion. The authors have performed this procedure for several patients without complications.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972427","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.586467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.218736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Metatarsophalangeal articulations","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsophalangeal_articulations"},{"name":"Reamer","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamer"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Incandescent light bulb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Fusion (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_(music)"}]}
