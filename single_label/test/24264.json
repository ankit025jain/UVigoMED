{"id":24264,"title":"Universal intravenous access cleaning device fails to sterilize stopcocks.","abstract":"Contamination of a central venous catheter may occur through use of conventional open-lumen stopcock devices (COLDs), or disinfectable, needleless, closed connectors (DNCCs). We investigated the effectiveness of a new universal IV access cleaning device (Site-Scrub) compared with 70% isopropyl alcohol prep pads for sanitizing COLDs or DNCCs inoculated with common catheter-associated pathogens.Site-Scrub was compared with 70% alcohol prep pads for sanitizing contaminated female Luer lock COLD or DNCC filled with sterile saline or propofol and 2 common bacterial central venous catheter contaminants (Staphylococcus epidermidis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Devices were contaminated using a glove touch (COLD and DNCC) or syringe tip (COLD). The primary end point of the study was colony-forming units (CFU) after 24 hours.The use of glove touch contamination, the contaminants, S epidermidis and P aeruginosa, produced CFU in saline-filled COLDs treated with the Site-Scrub, but not in those treated with alcohol pads (P < 0.001). Similar results were observed with propofol-filled COLDs (P < 0.001). For DNCCs filled with saline or propofol, both alcohol and Site-Scrub effectively reduced CFU growth compared with contaminated controls (P < 0.001). When COLDs were contaminated by treated syringe tips, there was no significant evidence of reduction in CFU growth by using either alcohol pads or Site-Scrub compared with contaminated controls.These data suggest that when the inner surface of the COLD is contaminated, both alcohol pads and Site-Scrub were not significantly effective in decontaminating the COLD. When the COLD rim is contaminated, however, alcohol pads outperform Site-Scrub. DNCCs were uniformly decontaminated with either treatment. Future work should focus on better access systems because current COLDs are difficult to decontaminate.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445634","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus epidermidis","weight":0.962322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_epidermidis"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Isopropyl alcohol","weight":0.882464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.874947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.80378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.798092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.55773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.414288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.301356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Human decontamination","weight":0.279122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_decontamination"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Glove","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral venous catheter","weight":0.0346536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Luer taper","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luer_taper"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
