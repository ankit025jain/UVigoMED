{"id":90519,"title":"[Posterior partial trochanteric osteotomy for the treatment of the roof involved acetabular fractures].","abstract":"To introduce a new trochanteric osteotomy,and evaluate the outcome of the procedure combined a posterior lateral approach in treating acetabular fractures which involving the roof.Between March 2007 and Novmber 2010,30 patients with displaced acetabular fractures involving the dome need trochanteric osteotomy were retrospectively reviewed. There were 21 males and 9 females,ranging in age from 18 to 70 years with an average of 35.2 years at the time of injury. According to Letournel-Judet classification, there were 10 posterior wall fractures,7 posterior column fractures,5 transverse fractures, 2 T-shape fractures, 1 transverse associated with posterior wall fracture, 3 posterior column and wall fractures and 2 bicolumn fractures. The standards of Matta,the modified Merle d'Aubigne-Postel, Medical Research Council were respectively used to evaluate the reduction result, function of hip joint and the strength of hip abduction.All patients were followed up with an average time of 25 months (18 to 40) and all osteotomy sites obtained bone union with an average time of 8.4 weeks (6 to 12). No bone non-union, bone block displaceing, internal fixation looseing and breaking,infection of deep part were found. Seventeen patients got anatomic reduction, 12 got satisfied reduction, and 1 got unsatisfied result according to the criteria of Matta. At final follow-up, function of hip joint obtained excellent results in 11 cases, good in 15, fair in 3 and poor in 1. The strength of the abductors of 3 patients were grade 4 and 27 patients were grade 5.Posterior partial great trochanteric osteotomy can enhance the exposure and provide a more accurate reduction and degrade the difficulty of acetabular fracture fixation without increasing the risk of complications. The method provide a new way for the treatment of the roof involved acetabular fractures.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605752","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.572881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.562366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.547806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.512732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip joint","weight":0.356769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.309756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.233897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.141995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical Research Council (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council_(UK)"},{"name":"Posterior column","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_column"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"},{"name":"Roof","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Dome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"UK Research Councils","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Research_Councils"},{"name":"Fifth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_grade"},{"name":"Fourth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_grade"},{"name":"Merle (dog coat)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_(dog_coat)"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
