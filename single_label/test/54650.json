{"id":54650,"title":"Multifocal electroretinography in subjects with age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To evaluate retinal function objectively in subjects with different stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) and compare it with age-matched control group.A total of 42 subjects with AMD and 37 age-matched healthy control group aged over 55 years were included in this prospective study. mfERG test was performed to all subjects. Average values in concentric ring analysis in four rings (ring 1, from 0° to 5° of eccentricity relative to fixation; ring 2, from 5° to 10°; ring 3, from 10° to 15°; ring 4, over 15°) and in quadrant analysis (superior nasal quadrant, superior temporal quadrant, inferior nasal quadrant and inferior temporal quadrant) were recorded. Test results were evaluated by one-way ANOVA test and independent samples t test.In mfERG concentric ring analysis, N1 amplitude, P1 amplitude and N2 amplitude were found to be lower and N1 implicit time, P1 implicit time and N2 implicit time were found to be delayed in subjects with AMD compared to control group. In quadrant analysis, N1, P1 and N2 amplitude was lower in all quadrants, whereas N1 implicit time was normal and P1 and N2 implicit times were prolonged in subjects with AMD.mfERG is a useful test in evaluating retinal function in subjects with AMD. AMD affects both photoreceptors and inner retinal function at late stages.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253559","annotations":[{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.369595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.153973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Orbital eccentricity","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Ordinary differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Superior temporal gyrus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_temporal_gyrus"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Ring (computer security)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(computer_security)"},{"name":"Inferior temporal gyrus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_temporal_gyrus"},{"name":"External nasal nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_nasal_nerve"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Concentric","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"N2 road (South Africa)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N2_road_(South_Africa)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
