{"id":79278,"title":"Is stroke rehabilitation a metabolic problem?","abstract":"This study looks at the impact of inflammation during the rehabilitation stage of strokes and its effect on neuro-functional recovery.This study investigated 94 patients suffering from strokes and admitted to rehabilitation. Anthropometric characteristics, serum proteins and inflammatory markers, plasma amino acids and neurofunction were all assessed.55.3% patients had an inflammatory status (Interleukin-6?=?19.24?±?23.01?pg?ml?¹ vs. 4.1?±?1.6?pg?ml?¹ for non-inflamed subjects (p?<?0.001). Inflammation was positively linked to positive proteins (alpha-1 globulin, p?<?0.02) and negatively linked to negative proteins (albumin, p?<?0.02; prealbumin, p?<?0.01; transferrin, p?<?0.05) of the acute-phase response. Inflammation was associated with low plasma concentrations of total amino acids. For the multiple logistic regression analysis, albumin (p?<?0.001) and body weight maintenance (p?<?0.001) were independent predictors of patient functional independence. Inflammation in dysphagic stroke (31.9%) patients was associated with more accentuated disability compared to non-inflamed dysphagics. The serum positive reactant alpha 1 globulin was the most powerful predictor of dysphagia severity (p?<?0.001). At discharge, dysphagia improvement was associated with improved acute-phase negative proteins.An inflammatory status may persist for most patients with strokes during the rehabiliation stage of the disease, its prevalence being higher in dysphagic compared to non-dysphagic subjects. The improvement in circulating albumin and body weight maintenance are predictors of neuro-function, even in dysphagic subjects.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456056","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.784746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.63546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood proteins","weight":0.480113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_proteins"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.214498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(neuropsychology)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0520117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Stroke recovery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_recovery"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
