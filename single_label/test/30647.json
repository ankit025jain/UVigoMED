{"id":30647,"title":"[Research on early warning signals of adverse drug reactions to parenterally administered xiyanping based on spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data].","abstract":"This article focused on early warning signals regarding the safety of parenterally administered Xiyanping. The study data was obtained from reports made between 2005-2012 from the national spontaneous reporting system (SRS). Proportion reporting ratio (PRR) and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) algorithms were used to analyse: erythra, pruritus, anaphylactoid reactions and shiver with cold, these 4 adverse drug reactions had a total count of more than 500 events. The article found that Xiyanping's incidence rate of erythra was higher than for background-drugs in every year and in every season. Pruritus was an early warning signal in the second season of 2009, and anaphylactoid reaction was an early warning signal in the fourth season of 2011 and in the second season of 2012. There was however no early warning signal indicated by shiver with cold. This data indicates that erythra maybe an adverse drug reactions to parenterally administered Xiyanping, and if the incidence rate of pruritus and anaphylactoid reaction rises attention should be paid to its safety.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471321","annotations":[{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.619035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.509828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.353247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.310456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0438266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Shivering","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Early warning radar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_warning_radar"},{"name":"Pseudoanaphylaxis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoanaphylaxis"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Bayesian inference","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Pennsylvania Railroad","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad"},{"name":"Aposematism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism"},{"name":"2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season"},{"name":"2011 Major League Baseball season","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Major_League_Baseball_season"}]}
