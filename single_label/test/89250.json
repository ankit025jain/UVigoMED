{"id":89250,"title":"Silver nanoparticle/bacterial cellulose gel membranes for antibacterial wound dressing: investigation in vitro and in vivo.","abstract":"Bacterial cellulose (BC) has attracted increasing attention as a novel wound dressing material, but its antimicrobial activity, which is one of the critical skin-barrier functions in wound healing, is not sufficient for use in practical applications. To overcome such a deficiency, silver nanoparticles were generated and self-assembled on the surface of BC nanofibers, forming a stable and evenly distributed Ag nanoparticle coated BC nanofiber (AgNP-BC). The performance of AgNP-BC was systematically studied in terms of antibacterial activities, cytocompatibility and effects on wound healing. The results showed that AgNP-BC exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, AgNP-BC allowed attachment, and growth of rat fibroblasts with low cytotoxicity emerged. Based on these advantages, AgNP-BC samples were applied in a second-degree rat wound model. Wound flora showed a significant reduction during the healing. The fresh epidermal and dermis thicknesses with AgNP-BC samples were 111 and 855 µm respectively, higher than 74 and 619 µm for BC groups and 57 and 473 µm for untreated control wounds. The results demonstrated that AgNP-BC could reduce inflammation and promote scald wound healing.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739469","annotations":[{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Cellulose","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.679894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.643651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.605455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Silver nanoparticles","weight":0.519924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_nanoparticles"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.465761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.46502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.443995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.417218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.362412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.328979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Carbon nanofiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanofiber"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
