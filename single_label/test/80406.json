{"id":80406,"title":"Plasmodium falciparum antigenic variation: relationships between widespread endothelial activation, parasite PfEMP1 expression and severe malaria.","abstract":"Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1(PfEMP1) is a family of variant surface antigens (VSA) that mediate the adhesion of parasite infected erythrocytes to capillary endothelial cells within host tissues. Opinion is divided over the role of PfEMP1 in the widespread endothelial activation associated with severe malaria. In a previous study we found evidence for differential associations between defined VSA subsets and specific syndromes of severe malaria: group A-like PfEMP1 expression and the \"rosetting\" phenotype were associated with impaired consciousness and respiratory distress, respectively. This study explores the involvement of widespread endothelial activation in these associations.We used plasma angiopoietin-2 as a marker of widespread endothelial activation. Using logistic regression analysis, we explored the relationships between plasma angiopoietin-2 levels, parasite VSA expression and the two syndromes of severe malaria, impaired consciousness and respiratory distress.Plasma angiopoietin-2 was associated with both syndromes. The rosetting phenotype did not show an independent association with respiratory distress when adjusted for angiopoietin-2, consistent with a single pathogenic mechanism involving widespread endothelial activation. In contrast, group A-like PfEMP1 expression and angiopoietin-2 maintained independent associations with impaired consciousness when adjusted for each other.The results are consistent with multiple pathogenic mechanisms leading to severe malaria and heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of impaired consciousness. The observed association between group A-like PfEMP1 and impaired consciousness does not appear to involve widespread endothelial activation.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674301","annotations":[{"name":"Antigenic variation","weight":0.881947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_variation"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.685154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.650644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.603748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.536687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.316904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.261516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.209583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.103847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Angiopoietin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiopoietin"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
