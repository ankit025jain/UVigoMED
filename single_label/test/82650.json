{"id":82650,"title":"Transcaruncular medial canthal tendon plication with lower eyelid suture sling in facial nerve palsy.","abstract":"To report a technique for correcting lower eyelid punctal ectropion with an inferiorly displaced or retracted medial eyelid due to facial nerve palsy, by extending a suture sling along the pre-tarsal lower eyelid when performing transcaruncular medial canthal tendon plication.Single-centre retrospective, non-comparative review of patients with facial nerve palsy who underwent medial canthal tendon plication with lower eyelid suture sling (MCT suture sling). Outcome measures included: the presence of lower eyelid ectropion, medial eyelid height, punctal position, inferior marginal reflex distance (MRD) and inferior scleral show measured both pre-operatively and at the last follow-up visit.Thirty-three patients with facial nerve palsy with a mean age of 59, underwent MCT suture sling for lagophthalmos and/or ectropion. Then, 66% (21/32) of cases had punctal ectropion pre-operatively and 9% (3/32) had punctal ectropion at the last follow-up. Medial eyelid height was deemed to improve in 66% (21/32) of cases at the last follow up visit. Follow-up was mean 13.5 months. Six (18%) patients were deemed failures due to inferior MRD and inferior scleral showing worse than pre-operative measurements.We report a technique for incorporating a suture sling to transcaruncular-approach MCT plication when the medial canthus has retracted or descended thus requiring support and a posterior vector. It avoids rounding of the medial canthal angle that may occur with traditional medial canthoplasty. Transcaruncular MCT plication is well described. Incorporating a suture sling to potentially reduce single point-fixation cheese-wiring and early dehiscence is minimally invasive, non-excisional and repeatable.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568677","annotations":[{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.726276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.553624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Canthus","weight":0.488651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canthus"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.354443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.349045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Ectropion","weight":0.338889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectropion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.197204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0698746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Facial nerve paralysis","weight":0.0657355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve_paralysis"},{"name":"Lagophthalmos","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagophthalmos"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sling (weapon)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(weapon)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Rounding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"}]}
