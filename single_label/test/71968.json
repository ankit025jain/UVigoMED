{"id":71968,"title":"Feasibility of multimodal deformable registration for head and neck tumor treatment planning.","abstract":"To investigate the feasibility of using deformable registration in clinical practice to fuse MR and CT images of the head and neck for treatment planning.A state-of-the-art deformable registration algorithm was optimized, evaluated, and compared with rigid registration. The evaluation was based on manually annotated anatomic landmarks and regions of interest in both modalities. We also developed a multiparametric registration approach, which simultaneously aligns T1- and T2-weighted MR sequences to CT. This was evaluated and compared with single-parametric approaches.Our results show that deformable registration yielded a better accuracy than rigid registration, without introducing unrealistic deformations. For deformable registration, an average landmark alignment of approximatively 1.7 mm was obtained. For all the regions of interest excluding the cerebellum and the parotids, deformable registration provided a median modified Hausdorff distance of approximatively 1 mm. Similar accuracies were obtained for the single-parameter and multiparameter approaches.This study demonstrates that deformable registration of head-and-neck CT and MR images is feasible, with overall a significanlty higher accuracy than for rigid registration.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015199","annotations":[{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.343031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Hausdorff distance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Genome project","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_project"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Administrative divisions of Ukraine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Ukraine"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"Region of interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_interest"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Deformation (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Hausdorff space","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Relaxation (NMR)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Landmark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark"}]}
