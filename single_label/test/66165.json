{"id":66165,"title":"Early return of continence in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy using modified maximal urethral length preservation technique.","abstract":"To evaluate the impact of maximal urethral length preservation (MULP) technique in comparison with posterior urethral reconstruction and anterior bladder suspension (PRAS) technique on the continence rates (CR), time to achieve continence among patients with prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).We prospectively analyzed the CR, time to achieve continence, pre- and postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, rates of positive margins among three groups of continent men with PCa undergoing RALP from whom consent was obtained. Each group consisted of 30 patients: PRAS was performed in group A, combined MULP and PRAS in group B, and MULP in group C. Continence was measured by patient self-reporting of the number of pads/24?h.No differences were detected in the age, preoperative PSA levels, biochemical recurrence, prostate volume, and positive margins for the three groups. Men in groups B and C had marked improvement in CR 1, 3, and 6 months after catheter removal vs group A (50% and 70% vs 10%, 90% and 96.66% vs 23.3% and 100%, 100% vs 53.3%, respectively, P<0.0001). The average and median times to continence were significantly shorter in group B (5.4 and 4 weeks) and C (3.8 and 3 weeks) vs group A (27.4 and 22.5 weeks), P<0.00001. Using Cox regression analysis, only MULP and MULP+PRAS techniques were significantly correlated with continence outcomes 1, 3, and 6 months after catheter removal.MULP rather than PRAS confers higher postoperative CR and shorter time to achieve continence among patients with PCa who underwent RALP without increasing risk of positive margin.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739066","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.756014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.647165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.633231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.556969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.546535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.498832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.242562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Continent","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"County Route 1 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Route_1_(Monmouth_County,_New_Jersey)"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0178944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sanitary napkin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_napkin"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 27","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_27"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
