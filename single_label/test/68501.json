{"id":68501,"title":"Reduced expression of miRNA-27a modulates cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer by targeting the cystine/glutamate exchanger SLC7A11.","abstract":"Resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a major obstacle to bladder cancer treatment. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNA) that are dysregulated in cisplatin-resistant disease, ascertain how these contribute to a drug-resistant phenotype, and how this resistance might be overcome.miRNA expression in paired cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cell lines was measured. Dysregulated miRNAs were further studied for their ability to mediate resistance. The nature of the cisplatin-resistant phenotype was established by measurement of cisplatin/DNA adducts and intracellular glutathione (GSH). Candidate miRNAs were examined for their ability to (i) mediate resistance and (ii) alter the expression of a candidate target protein (SLC7A11); direct regulation of SLC7A11 was confirmed using a luciferase assay. SLC7A11 protein and mRNA, and miRNA-27a were quantified in patient tumor material.A panel of miRNAs were found to be dysregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. miRNA-27a was found to target the cystine/glutamate exchanger SLC7A11 and to contribute to cisplatin resistance through modulation of GSH biosynthesis. In patients, SLC7A11 expression was inversely related to miRNA-27a expression, and those tumors with high mRNA expression or high membrane staining for SLC7A11 experienced poorer clinical outcomes. Resistant cell lines were resensitized by restoring miRNA-27a expression or reducing SLC7A11 activity with siRNA or with sulfasalazine.Our findings indicate that miRNA-27a negatively regulates SLC7A11 in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer, and shows promise as a marker for patients likely to benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. SLC7A11 inhibition with sulfasalazine may be a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of cisplatin-resistant disease.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516043","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.786694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.364312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.189614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sulfasalazine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfasalazine"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Adduct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduct"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"}]}
