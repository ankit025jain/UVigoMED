{"id":35205,"title":"Hybrid perventricular pulmonary valve perforation and right ventricular outflow stent placement: a case report of a premature, 1.3-kg neonate with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia.","abstract":"Premature infants with very low birth weight with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia (TOF/PA) have been shown to have poor surgical outcomes. Palliating these patients by stenting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) has been shown to be safe and effective. In patients with very low birth weight, a hybrid perventricular approach offers the ability to perform pulmonary valve perforation and RVOT stent placement while avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and femoral vessel complications in the neonatal period. We present a hybrid perventricular treatment of a patient weighing 1.3 kg with TOF/PA.
