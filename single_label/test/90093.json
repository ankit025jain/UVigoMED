{"id":90093,"title":"Dual-energy computed tomographic tendon algorithm in acute trauma: initial experiences.","abstract":"Computed tomography has become increasingly popular in the assessment of limbs in the acute trauma setting. Bony anatomic detail is excellent; however, soft tissue detail is typically limited, especially when compared with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The advent of dual-energy computed tomography has allowed additional information to be gathered regarding the morphology of collagen-based soft tissue structures. We report our initial experiences of 4 cases with imaging and clinical correlation.
