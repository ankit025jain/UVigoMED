{"id":45881,"title":"Survival prognostic factors in patients with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis treated with cytoreductive surgery and intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy: a single institution experience.","abstract":"The aim of this research was to examine overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (CRC-PC), treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), as well as to analyse factors of prognostic significance.We included 61 patients with pathological/and computerized tomography (CT) confirmation of CRC-PC, treated with CRS+HIPEC from 2005 to 2012. Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) score was used for quantitative assessment of the CRC-PC extent. We performed CRS following the Sugarbaker's principles in all patients with PCI ?20 and only in 3/61 (4.92%) patients with PCI >20. HIPEC (oxaliplatin 410 mg/m(2) in 2000mL isotonic solution and 41?C) was performed using RanD PerformerÂ® HT perfusion system during 30-60 min. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine significant factors for OS and DFS.The follow-up ranged from 1 to 83 months (median 22). Median OS was 51 months (95% confidence interval/ CI 22+). Median DFS for patients without residual disease (57/61, 93.44%) was 23 months (95% CI 16+). One-, 2- and 6-year OS (DFS) were 78.6% (68.3%), 58.7% (46.7%) and 50.5% (38.1%), respectively. By the end of the study, 55.74% of the patients were still alive. Cox multivariate analysis indicated PCI score as a parameter of highly prognostic significance for patients treated with CRS+HIPEC (p<0.001). Patients with PCI (13 (vs PCI ?13) had significantly longer OS and DFS (p<0.001), also confirmed for PCI subcategories (PCI <7 vs 7? PCI <13 vs PCI ?13). All patients with PCI <7 are still alive.Our study indicates that CRS+HIPEC significantly improves the survival of CRC-PC patients. This treatment modality should be considered as the most suitable in well-selected patients with this disease.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Digestive System
