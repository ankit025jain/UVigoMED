{"id":55736,"title":"Central serous chorioretinopathy following kidney transplantation.","abstract":"A lesser known complication of long-term corticosteroid therapy is chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). Although idiopathic CSCR is known to be mild with spontaneous improvement and minimal effects on the vision, chronic CSCR is different and may cause irreversible visual loss. We report four patients with CSCR on corticosteroid therapy after kidney transplant. The interesting point about these patients is that they were of a younger age group compared with classic CSCR cases, and there were two females among the patients. Organ transplantation and corticosteroid therapy are the risk factors for CSCR. We should discontinue or at least reduce corticosteroid dosage. Knowledge about this rare complication after kidney transplantation (even in unusual age and sex) is important.
