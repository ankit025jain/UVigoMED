{"id":50525,"title":"[Malignant ovarian germ cell tumors. Current status of diagnosis and treatment].","abstract":"Malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (MOGCT) are extremely aggressive and rapidly growing neoplasms, with a peak incidence occurring in adolescent girls and young women. Its incidence in Mexico is three times higher than the observed in Western countries and the United States. Dysgerminoma, immature teratoma, yolk salc tumor, and mixed germ cell tumors make up more than 90% of all MOGCT.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779273","annotations":[{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.797508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Dysgerminoma","weight":0.765385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgerminoma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.753565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Germ cell tumor","weight":0.69084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell_tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.626889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Egg yolk","weight":0.293806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_yolk"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.228691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.0883103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}]}
