{"id":82626,"title":"Results of anterior facial nerve rerouting procedures for removing skull base tumors.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to estimate the rates of functional recovery of the facial nerve and of total tumor resection in patients who undergo short anterior rerouting and long anterior rerouting of the facial nerve in removal of skull base tumors.We retrospectively collected data on 37 patients with skull base tumors who underwent facial nerve rerouting during the procedure for tumor removal. Information on the rerouting technique, the completeness of tumor resection, and changes in facial nerve function were obtained from the medical records. Rerouting techniques were classified as short anterior rerouting or long anterior rerouting.Ten of 16 patients (62.5%) in the group with short anterior rerouting showed postoperative facial palsy, and all completely recovered within 1 year. In the group with long anterior rerouting, 18 of 21 patients (85.7%) showed postoperative facial palsy, and recovery to a preoperative level of facial function was found in 10 patients at 1 year of follow-up. Total tumor resection was possible in 94% and 81% of patients with short rerouting and long rerouting, respectively. The mean operation time was not significantly related to the postoperative recovery of facial function.Short rerouting techniques, when appropriately chosen on the basis of tumor and patient characteristics, offer excellent preservation of facial function and tumor resection, comparable to those of long rerouting techniques.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574470","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.124895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.111055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0884832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0285246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0223718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Base of skull","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_of_skull"}]}
