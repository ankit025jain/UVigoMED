{"id":88465,"title":"Stem cells and G-CSF for treating neuroinflammation in traumatic brain injury: aging as a comorbidity factor.","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), often called the signature wound of Iraq and Afghanistan wars, is characterized by a progressive histopathology and long-lasting behavioral deficits. Treatment options for TBI are limited and patients are usually relegated to rehabilitation therapy and a handful of experimental treatments. Stem cell-based therapies offer alternative treatment regimens for TBI, and have been intended to target the delayed therapeutic window post-TBI, in order to promote \"neuroregeneration,\" in lieu of \"neuroprotection\" which can be accomplished during acute TBI phase. However, these interventions may require adjunctive pharmacological treatments especially when aging is considered as a comorbidity factor for post-TBI health outcomes. Here, we put forward the concept that a combination therapy of human umbilical cord blood cell (hUCB) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) attenuates neuroinflammation in TBI, in view of the safety and efficacy profiles of hUCB and G-CSF, their respective mechanisms of action, and efficacy of hUCB+G-CSF combination therapy in TBI animal models. Further investigations on the neuroinflammatory pathway as a key pathological hallmark in acute and chronic TBI and also as a major therapeutic target of hUCB+G-CSF are warranted in order to optimize the translation of this combination therapy in the clinic.
