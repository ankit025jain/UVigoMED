{"id":4461,"title":"TRICARE; coverage of care related to non-covered initial surgery or treatment. Final rule.","abstract":"This final rule revises the limitations on certain TRICARE basic program benefits. More specifically, it allows coverage for otherwise covered services and supplies required in the treatment of complications (unfortunate sequelae), as well as medically necessary and appropriate follow-on care, resulting from a non-covered incident of treatment provided pursuant to a properly granted Supplemental Health Care Program waiver. This final rule amends two provisions of the TRICARE regulations which limits coverage for the treatment of complications resulting from a non-covered incident of treatment, and which expressly excludes from coverage in the Basic Program services and supplies related to a non-covered condition or treatment.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562894","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.170357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"TRICARE","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRICARE"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Basic life support","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_life_support"},{"name":"Waiver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiver"},{"name":"Canada Health Act","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Health_Act"},{"name":"Historical revisionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism"}]}
