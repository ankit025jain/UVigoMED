{"id":61154,"title":"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and MDR1 and the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"The damage caused by oxidative stress and exposure to cigarette smoke and alcohol necessitate DNA damage repair and transport by multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1). To explore the association between polymorphisms in these genes and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk, we analyzed 15 polymorphisms of 12 genes in a population-based study in Korea (694 cases and 1700 controls). Four genotypes of DNA repair pathway genes (XRCC1 399 GA, OGG1 326 GG, BRCA1 871 TT, and WRN 787 TT) were associated with a decreased risk for NHL [odds ratio (OR)XRCC1 GA=0.80, p=0.02; OROGG1 GG=0.70, p=0.008; ORBRCA1 TT=0.71, p=0.048; ORWRN TT=0.68, p=0.01]. Conversely, the MGMT 115 CT genotype was associated with an increased risk for NHL (OR=1.25, p=0.04). In the MDR1 gene, the 1236 CC genotype was associated with a decreased risk for NHL (OR=0.74, p=0.04), and the 3435 CT and TT genotypes were associated with an increased risk (OR3435CT=1.50, p<0.0001; OR3435TT=1.43, p=0.02). These results suggest that polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes XRCC1, OGG1, BRCA1, WRN1, and MGMT and in the MDR1 gene may affect the risk for NHL in Korean patients.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756092","annotations":[{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.729003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.678041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.604271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.578961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.553862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.523427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.501841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"XRCC1","weight":0.117191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRCC1"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"Ogg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"MGMT","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGMT"},{"name":"Oxoguanine glycosylase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxoguanine_glycosylase"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0229923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"399","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/399"},{"name":"871","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/871"},{"name":"1700","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1700"},{"name":"1236","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1236"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_syndrome_ATP-dependent_helicase"},{"name":"CT1","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT1"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"}]}
