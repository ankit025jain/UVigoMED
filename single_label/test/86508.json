{"id":86508,"title":"NCOA1 Directly Targets M-CSF1 Expression to Promote Breast Cancer Metastasis.","abstract":"In breast cancer, overexpression of the nuclear coactivator NCOA1 (SRC-1) is associated with disease recurrence and resistance to endocrine therapy. To examine the impact of NCOA1 overexpression on morphogenesis and carcinogenesis in the mammary gland (MG), we generated MMTV-hNCOA1 transgenic [Tg(NCOA1)] mice. In the context of two distinct transgenic models of breast cancer, NCOA1 overexpression did not affect the morphology or tumor-forming capability of MG epithelial cells. However, NCOA1 overexpression increased the number of circulating breast cancer cells and the efficiency of lung metastasis. Mechanistic investigations showed that NCOA1 and c-Fos were recruited to a functional AP-1 site in the macrophage attractant CSF1 promoter, directly upregulating colony-simulating factor 1 (CSF1) expression to enhance macrophage recruitment and metastasis. Conversely, silencing NCOA1 reduced CSF1 expression and decreased macrophage recruitment and breast cancer cell metastasis. In a cohort of 453 human breast tumors, NCOA1 and CSF1 levels correlated positively with disease recurrence, higher tumor grade, and poor prognosis. Together, our results define an NCOA1/AP-1/CSF1 regulatory axis that promotes breast cancer metastasis, offering a novel therapeutic target for impeding this process.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769444","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.784752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.667074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.524517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.449517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.383756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.332609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Coactivator (genetics)","weight":0.287718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"AP-1 transcription factor","weight":0.179812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP-1_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
