{"id":33963,"title":"Complete eradication of chronic long standing eczema and keratosis pilaris following treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate.","abstract":"To present two other dermatologic conditions related to a disorder of sympathetic nervous system hypofunction common in women that respond to treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate--chronic eczema and keratosis pilaris.Case 1 was a patient with chronic eczema of 30 years duration was started on treatment for other conditions related to the sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome, i.e., migraine headaches and chronic fatigue syndrome. Case 2 who also had chronic eczema also had a skin condition frequently associated with eczema--keratosis pilaris and he was started on dextroamphetamine sulfate for chronic fatigue syndrome.Not only did the headaches and chronic fatigue syndrome in both patients markedly improve following sympathomimetic amine therapy but so did the eczema and keratosis pilaris.Eczema and keratosis pilaris are two more chronic dermatologic conditions besides chronic urticaria and prurigo nodularis that respond extremely well to treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate. Case 2 shows this condition is not restricted to females.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779252","annotations":[{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.892699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Chronic fatigue syndrome","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.85644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.815539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Sympathomimetic drug","weight":0.799641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathomimetic_drug"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Dextroamphetamine","weight":0.483736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Keratosis pilaris","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratosis_pilaris"},{"name":"Prurigo nodularis","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prurigo_nodularis"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.168332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Keratosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratosis"}]}
