{"id":2791,"title":"Laser-assisted mini-capsulotomy: a new technique for intumescent white cataracts.","abstract":"To describe a new two-step femtosecond laser-assisted technique for intumescent white cataracts.In 6 eyes with intumescent white cataracts, a laser-assisted mini-capsulotomy was performed first to release the intralenticular pressure. In the next step, the fluid milky lens material was removed from the anterior chamber before the eyes were re-docked to the laser system and a second larger anterior capsulotomy (4.5-mm diameter) was performed. Finally, the cataractous lens material was removed followed by intraocular lens implantation in the capsular bag.In all cases, the laser system was able to identify and cut the anterior capsule without complications. Small residual tissue bridges were recognized after laser-assisted mini-capsulotomy in 2 eyes and solved with the dimple-down maneuver. The second, larger capsulotomy demonstrated satisfactory quality and a 360Â° overlap on the intraocular lens' optic was achieved in all cases.This novel technique for intumescent white cataracts using a two-step laser-assisted mini-capsulotomy has the potential to avoid complications.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375846","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.757284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.731461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.641605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.416665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.401818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Intumescent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intumescent"},{"name":"History of psychosurgery in the United Kingdom","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_psychosurgery_in_the_United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
