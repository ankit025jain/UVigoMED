{"id":25335,"title":"Non-invasive quick diagnosis of cardiovascular problems from visible and invisible abnormal changes with increased cardiac troponin I appearing on cardiovascular representation areas of the eyebrows, left upper lip, etc. of the face & hands: beneficial ma","abstract":"Our previous study indicated that there are at least 7 cardiovascular representation areas on the face, including the \"Eyebrows\", both sides of the \"Nose\", \"Lelt Upper Lip\" and the \"Outside of the corner of both sides of the mouth,\" in addition to 2 areas in each hand. When there are cardiovascular problems, some of the heart representation areas of these areas often show the following changes: 1) Most distinctive visible changes such as the initial whitening with or without long white hair, then hair loss and complete disappearance of the hairs of the heart representation area of \"Eyebrows\" 2) Invisible biochemical changes that happen in heart representation areas at the \"Left Upper Lips\", 3) \"Nose\" below eye level as well as 4) \"3rd segment of Middle Finger of Hands.\" Most distinctive visible & invisible changes are found in heart representation areas on the \"Eyebrow\", located nearest to the midline of face, where the color of the hairs becomes white compared with the rest of the Eyebrow. Then the cardiovascular problem advances, and hair starts disappearing. When there are no hairs at the heart representation areas of the Eyebrow, usually Cardiac Troponin I is increased to a very serious, abnormal high value. Most of the cardiovascular representation areas of the face show, regardless of presence or absence of visible change. When there is a cardiovascular problem, not only simple Bi-Digital O-Ring Test can detect without using any instrument in several minutes but also, corresponding biochemical changes of abnormally increased Cardiac Troponin I level can often be detected non-invasively from these Organ Representation Areas of Face & Hands, although changes in Eyebrows, L-Upper Lip & 3rd segment of middle fingers are clinically the most reliable changes & easy to identify the locations. Manual Stimulation of Hand's heart representation areas often eliminated acute anginal chest pain before medical help became available. Important factors for safe, effective treatment of heart disease & cancer were also presented. Significant beneficial effect of optimal dose of Vitamin D3 400 I.U. for average adult on heart, brain and cancer, and harmful effect of widely used 2000 I.U., was emphasized.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219029","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.791023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.766133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.726106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.476535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.341984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.279468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.274058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.242916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.200502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Eyebrow","weight":0.144265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyebrow"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Human hair color","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_color"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Invisibility","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibility"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
