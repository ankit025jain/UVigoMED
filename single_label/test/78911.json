{"id":78911,"title":"Cochlear implantation in asymmetrical hearing loss for children: our experience.","abstract":"Cochlear implantation in children with an asymmetrical hearing loss is now becoming more recognized as an appropriate and beneficial treatment option. In our programme, we have been implanting children with asymmetrical hearing loss since 2008. Asymmetrical hearing loss is defined as hearing loss when one ear meets criteria for cochlear implantation and the other ear has better hearing and receives benefit from a hearing aid. There is a wide range of asymmetrical hearing loss: single-sided deafness is the end of the spectrum. Amplification in asymmetrical hearing loss is usually difficult, it is often not possible to adequately aid the poorer ear; therefore patients often experience compromised hearing with adequate aiding of their better ear only. The impact of hearing with one ear on speech development, education, and employment is significant.
