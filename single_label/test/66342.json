{"id":66342,"title":"Robot-assisted renal surgery: current indications and results.","abstract":"Robotic technology is the natural evolution and simplification of traditional laparoscopy. Robotic surgery has the same benefits of traditional laparoscopic surgery in terms of cosmetic results, pain control and short in-hospital stay. However, magnified three-dimensional vision and the use of fully articulated wristed-instruments allow to increase the precision control. Recently, robotic surgery has been even more used in urology. In fact, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is currently the most common treatment used for localized prostate cancer in the United States. Perioperative and functional outcomes resulted significantly better after RARP. As a consequence of the diffusion of RARP, other urological procedures were performed using the robotic approach. Particular attention has been paid to the use of robotic surgery for the treatment of benign and malignant renal diseases. In 2002 the first robot-assisted pyeloplasty was performed followed by the first robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. This last procedure had widespread a lot in the last years and it can currently be considered as the main alternative to the traditional open partial nephrectomy. Finally, the evolution of technology and surgeon skills allowed us to consider the less invasive approaches also for renal transplantation surgery and vena cava tumor thrombectomy. The objective of this review was to analyze current indications and outcomes of robot-assisted procedures for the treatment of benign and malignant renal diseases.
