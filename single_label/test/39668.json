{"id":39668,"title":"Transcription factor T-bet regulates intraepithelial lymphocyte functional maturation.","abstract":"The intestinal epithelium harbors large populations of activated and memory lymphocytes, yet these cells do not cause tissue damage in the steady state. We investigated how intestinal T cell effector differentiation is regulated upon migration to the intestinal epithelium. Using gene loss- and gain-of-function strategies, as well as reporter approaches, we showed that cooperation between the transcription factors T-bet and Runx3 resulted in suppression of conventional CD4(+) T helper functions and induction of an intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) program that included expression of IEL markers such as CD8?? homodimers. Interferon-? sensing and T-bet expression by CD4(+) T cells were both required for this program, which was distinct from conventional T helper differentiation but shared by other IEL populations, including TCR??(+)CD8??(+) IELs. We conclude that the gut environment provides cues for IEL maturation through the interplay between T-bet and Runx3, allowing tissue-specific adaptation of mature T lymphocytes.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148025","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.881675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Intraepithelial lymphocyte","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraepithelial_lymphocyte"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.241043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Harbor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Steady state","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state"}]}
