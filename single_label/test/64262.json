{"id":64262,"title":"E-health to improve work functioning in employees with rheumatoid arthritis in rheumatology practice: a feasibility study.","abstract":"To evaluate the feasibility of an e-health intervention in rheumatology practice for employees with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who experience problems with work functioning.Twenty-three out of 90 patients with RA from a hospital rheumatology department, invited by letter, participated in a feasibility study. The 3-month internet e-health programme consisted of a self-management programme using a three-step problem-solving strategy: (step 1) analyse your work problems and opportunities; (step 3) identify solutions; and (step 3) work out a strategy (action plan). Support and personal feedback was provided by a rheumatology nurse. Patients completed assignments, received information, and actively worked on their goals. The main feasibility outcome included satisfaction with the programme. Other feasibility outcomes included usefulness, suitability, website use, and work functioning measured at baseline and/or 3 months using questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and website data.In total, 95% of the participants were satisfied with the programme, and 96% thought the programme was useful for working RA patients and would recommend the programme to other working RA patients (91%). On the website, all patients at least partially completed the assignments in step 1 and 12 patients completed at least one assignment in step 3. Patients judged the website as well arranged with clear tasks. Patients worked on a range of (individual) goals, resolving work challenges using different strategies and actions.The e-health intervention is a feasible intervention for rheumatology practice justifying further effectiveness evaluation while allowing for further improvements in the selection of RA patients and shaping the intervention.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25178316","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.42073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.366443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.122269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Arrangement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement"},{"name":"Letter (message)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(message)"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"Tennis court","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Offensive (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_(military)"},{"name":"Feasibility study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study"}]}
