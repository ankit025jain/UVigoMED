{"id":85751,"title":"[Survival of patients with biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Chilean National Thorax Institute experience].","abstract":"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is the most prevalent of all interstitial lung diseases. The usual underlying pathological picture is an interstitial pneumonia (UIP).To describe the evolution of a Chilean cohort of patients with IPF.Patients with the disease were identified at the pathology registry of National Institute of Thoracic Diseases, Santiago, Chile. Patients were included if they had surgical biopsy of UIP and compatible clinical and radiological characteristics. The medical records of included patients were reviewed, recording clinical information and lung function test results. Survival was analyzed obtaining death records from the Chilean National Identification Service.Data from 142 patients with a mean age of 58 years (42% men), were analyzed. Mean initial lung function showed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 73%, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) of 57% and a distance covered in 6-minute walk (6MWT) of 95% of expected normal values. The median survival was 80 months. Predictors of survival were a DLCO of less than 40% and an oxygen saturation at the end of the 6MWT of less than 89%.Survival in this group of patients was higher than the figures reported elsewhere. DLCO and the fall of oxygen saturation after walking were predictors of mortality, as previously described in other populations.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861108","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.929752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.772919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.699639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.618618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.577124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Lung function test","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_function_test"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.474907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.442693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.306082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.266109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.204458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Interstitial lung disease","weight":0.191855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_lung_disease"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.166561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"DLCO","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLCO"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Santiago","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
