{"id":13252,"title":"Lack of anti-tumor activity with the ?-catenin expression inhibitor EZN-3892 in the C57BL/6J Min/+ model of intestinal carcinogenesis.","abstract":"Previously, we showed that short-term inhibition of ?-catenin expression and reversal of aberrant ?-catenin subcellular localization by the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib is associated with adenoma regression in the C57BL/6J Min/+ mouse. Conversly, long-term administration resulted in tumor resistance, leading us to investigate alternative methods for selective ?-catenin chemoprevention. In this study, we hypothesized that disruption of ?-catenin expression by EZN-3892, a selective locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based ?-catenin inhibitor, would counteract the tumorigenic effect of Apc loss in Min/+ adenomas while preserving normal intestinal function.C57BL/6J Apc(+/+) wild-type (WT) and Min/+ mice were treated with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of EZN-3892 (30mg/kg). Drug effect on tumor numbers, ?-catenin protein expression, and nuclear ?-catenin localization were determined.Although the tumor phenotype and ?-catenin nuclear localization in Min/+ mice did not change following drug administration, we observed a decrease in ?-catenin expression levels in the mature intestinal tissue of treated Min/+ and WT mice, providing proof of principle regarding successful delivery of the LNA-based antisense vehicle. Higher doses of EZN-3892 resulted in fatal outcomes in Min/+ mice, likely due to ?-catenin ablation in the intestinal tissue and loss of function.Our data support the critical role of Wnt/?-catenin signaling in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and highlight the challenges of effective drug delivery to target disease without permanent toxicity to normal cellular function.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486542","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleic
