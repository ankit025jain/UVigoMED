{"id":38734,"title":"Misplacement of left ventricular vent as a cause of cardioplegia failure during routine open-heart surgery.","abstract":"We report an unusual cause of failure of successful delivery of antegrade cardioplegia through the aortic root that was caused by the accidental passage of the left ventricular vent catheter across the aortic valve producing acute aortic regurgitation. This problem is best prevented.
