{"id":34769,"title":"Results and biomechanical consideration of treatment of congenital lower limb shortening and deformity using the Ilizarov method.","abstract":"One of the applications of the Ilizarov apparatus is the correction of congenital shortening and deformities. Ilizarov external fixator produces biomechanical structure with surrounding tissue, which is the reason why very important is correct stability of fixator. Large distraction in the case of high value of lengthening, and large deformity corection result in shear stresses that occur additionally in the regenerate, which can potentially lead to damage of the regenerating nutritive microcirculation of bone tissue and bone fragment displacements. Our objective was to assess the results of the Ilizarov method in the treatment of congenital shortening taking into account treatment strategy and the size of the axis of lengthening and correction. Our research problems include presenting the effects of biomechanics of musculoskeletal deformations on treatment results, presenting complications and their treatment. Between 1989 and 2009, 62 patients underwent surgery to correct congenital lower limb deficiencies at our Clinic; 33 patients were followed-up. In total, there were 70 surgeries (2.12/patient). Axial correction was performed in 26 patients (78.79%). Average age at the start of the treatment was 15.58 years. Mean follow-up was 8.58 years. Mean lengthening per surgery was 3.17 cm with the lengthening index of 50.7 day/cm. Results were very good for 23 patients, good for 7 patients, satisfactory for 3 patients. Complications appeared in 24 patients, problems occurred in 74.42% of the cases, obstacles in 4.65% of cases, and true complications in 20.93% of the cases. The best results were achieved in the treatment of patients with two-stage and two-segment lengthening with a total elongation of less than 7 cm, and without correction of the axis. Congenital shortening of the lower limb should be treated comprehensively because the shortening applies to all segments, and disturbs biomechanics of all lower limb. In the case of axial correction and large amount of elongation high soft tissue forces counteract the distraction forces. Hybrid construction may help to shorten treatment time, increase fixator stability and decrease rate of complications. We suggest use of hybrid Ilizarov fixator, especially when large elongation and axis corection are planned.
