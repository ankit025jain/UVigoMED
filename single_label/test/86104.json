{"id":86104,"title":"Influenza season 2012-2013 in Europe: moderate intensity, mixed (sub)types.","abstract":"This paper summarizes influenza activity in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in 2012-2013. The influenza season 2012-2013 in Europe lasted from early December to late April. Overall the severity of the season could be described as moderate, based on the ILI/ARI consultation rates and the percentage of sentinel specimens positive for influenza compared to previous seasons. Both influenza A and B viruses circulating accounted for 47% and 53% of positive sentinel specimens, respectively, with both A(H1) and A(H3) varying for dominance. Compared to outpatients, the proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalized cases infected by A(H1N1)pdm09 was significantly higher in middle-aged patients (33% vs. 17%, ? 2 = 66·6, P < 0·01). Despite a relatively good match between vaccine and circulating strains, vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be moderate.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814635","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.677663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.599035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.565968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Flu season","weight":0.367384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"AH1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH1"},{"name":"AH3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH3"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Islamic calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Number of the Beast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast"},{"name":"Subtypes of HIV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtypes_of_HIV"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
