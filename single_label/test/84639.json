{"id":84639,"title":"Systematic comparison of bacterial feeding strains for increased yield of Caenorhabditis elegans males by RNA interference-induced non-disjunction.","abstract":"Rare Caenorhabditis elegans males arise when sex chromosome non-disjunction occurs during meiosis in self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. Non-disjunction is a relatively rare event, and males are typically observed at a frequency of less than one in five hundred wild-type animals. Males are required for genetic crosses and phenotypic analysis, yet current methods to generate large numbers of males can be cumbersome. Here, we identify RNAi reagents (dsRNA-expressing bacteria) with improved effectiveness for eliciting males. Specifically, we used RNAi to systematically reduce the expression of over two hundred genes with meiotic chromosome segregation functions, and we identified a set of RNAi reagents that robustly and reproducibly elicited male progeny.
