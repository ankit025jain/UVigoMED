{"id":82872,"title":"Wear behavior between zirconia and titanium as an antagonist on fixed dental prostheses.","abstract":"The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the wear behavior of the abrader when tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (TZP), cp-titanium (CpTi) and Ti-6Al-4V alloy (TiAlV) were used as the antagonist on fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). Both hemisphere abrader and flat substrate specimens were prepared using TZP, CpTi and TiAlV. Two-body wear tests were performed in distilled water, and the wear volume of the abrader specimen was measured to evaluate the wear behavior. In addition, scanning microscopic observation and an electron probe micro-analysis were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the wear. The wear volume of CpTi and TiAlV abrader specimens was approximately 20 times larger than that of TZP abrader specimen against all substrate specimens. This is due to the differences in hardness between the ultra-hardness of TZP and the comparatively low hardness of CpTi and TiAlV. The wear volume of CpTi and TiAlV abrader specimens against the TZP substrate was significantly smaller than for the CpTi and TiAlV substrates despite the hardness of TZP being much larger than those of CpTi and TiAlV. This phenomenon may be based on the adhesive wear mechanism. Elements of Ti, Al and V originating in the TiAlV substrate were detected adhering to the abrader CpTi specimen. These results suggest that FDPs of CpTi and TiAlV are susceptible to wear against not only TZP but also CpTi and TiAlV in contrast to TZP FDPs.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495945","annotations":[{"name":"Polycrystal","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrystal"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.832828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Alloy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.683333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Zirconium dioxide","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirconium_dioxide"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.640761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.623701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.516559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.485619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.171066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Wear","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"}]}
