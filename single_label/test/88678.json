{"id":88678,"title":"Treatment for wound pruritus following burns.","abstract":"To review the current literature on the treatment of itching, or pruritus, in people with burn wounds.A literature search using the databases PubMed, MEDLINE and Google Scholar was undertaken. Studies were included in the review if they discussed or evaluated different treatment options for pruritus in patients with burn wounds.A variety of treatments are available for the relief of pruritus in patients with burns wounds, ranging from antihistamines and topical emollients to psychological therapies, massage and dermatological treatments. Oral antihistamines are used most commonly, yet research indicates that these are not always effective. Few studies are methodologically robust. In recent years, there has been an attempt to design and implement treatment strategies and algorithms, however, there is currently no agreed and consistent management plan for the treatment of pruritus due to burn injury.Simple single therapies should be the first line therapy for the treatment of pruritus due to burns, however, if these are unsuccessful, combination therapy should be introduced early to try to reduce the onset of chronic itch. Current algorithms and treatment plans based on the stage of healing show promise but need further modification and testing before they can be recommended for common use.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810306","annotations":[{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.433195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.411455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.382994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.350431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.330556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.296487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.287573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.187499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Histamine antagonist","weight":0.109872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_antagonist"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Moisturizer","weight":0.0678564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Scholar","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
