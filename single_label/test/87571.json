{"id":87571,"title":"Significantly reduced radiation dose to operators during percutaneous vertebroplasty using a new cement delivery device.","abstract":"Percutaneous vertebroplasy (PVP) might lead to significant radiation exposure to patients, operators, and operating room personnel. Therefore, radiaton exposure is a concern. The aim of this study was to present a remote control cement delivery device and study whether it can reduce dose exposue to operators.After meticulous preoperative preparation, a series of 40 osteoporosis patients were treated with unilateral approach PVP using the new cement delivery divice. We compared levels of fluoroscopic exposure to operator standing on different places during operation. group A: operator stood about 4 meters away from X-ray tube behind the lead sheet. group B: operator stood adjacent to patient as using conventional manual cement delivery device.During whole operation process, radiation dose to the operator (group A) was 0.10 ± 0.03 (0.07-0.15) ?Sv, group B was 12.09 ± 4.67 (10-20) ?Sv. a difference that was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.001) between group A and group B.New cement delivery device plus meticulous preoperative preparation can significantly decrease radiation dose to operators.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084860","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.503242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.348635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Remote control","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control"},{"name":"Sievert","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Lead sheet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_sheet"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"1020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1020"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Portable media player","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_player"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
