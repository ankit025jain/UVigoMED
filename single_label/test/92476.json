{"id":92476,"title":"Influence of the anterior-posterior femoral translation on the range of motion in cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the post-operative range of motion (ROM) of the knee related to the anterior-posterior femoral translation on the tibia observed during surgery in cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a navigation system. Our hypothesis is that the intraoperative anterior-posterior femoral translation is correlated with the post-operative ROM in patients undergoing cruciate-retaining TKA.The subjects were 20 patients involving 23 joints. The passive maximum ROM was measured before and 1 year after surgery. In addition, we evaluated the intraoperative anterior-posterior femoral translation that was measured after inserting a tensor device from 10° to 120° of knee flexion. The starting point of the anterior-posterior femoral translation was defined as when the femur started to move posteriorly. The anterior-posterior femoral translation 120 was set as the amount of femoral movement from 10° to 120°.The subjects were divided into those with an increased or maintained ROM (group A) and those with a decreased ROM (group B). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the age or pre-operative ROM. The starting point of the anterior-posterior femoral translation was significantly earlier in group B (58.0 ± 5.7° for group A, 48.7 ± 3.2° for group B) (P < 0.05). Regarding the anterior-posterior femoral translation 120, Group B showed a larger amount of femoral movement posteriorly than group A (13.0 ± 6.5 mm for group A, 19.0 ± 6.2 mm for group B) (P < 0.05).The present study shows that intraoperative anterior-posterior femoral translation has a significant correlation with the post-operative ROM in patients undergoing cruciate-retaining TKA. If the starting point of the anterior-posterior femoral translation is early and the anterior-posterior femoral translation 120 is large, there is likely to be a decrease in the post-operative ROM.III.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794004","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.861622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.625454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.60373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.435293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.333534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.283637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.26988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.25922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"TKA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKA"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Global Positioning System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"6.5x52mm Mannlicher-Carcano","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6.5x52mm_Mannlicher-Carcano"},{"name":"Read-only memory","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 13","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_13"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Tensor","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor"}]}
