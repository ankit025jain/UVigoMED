{"id":89815,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of MRI to assess for posttraumatic ligamentous cervical spine injury.","abstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be sensitive in identifying ligamentous injury to the cervical spine. The major drawbacks to its routine use are cost and availability. The purpose of this study was to compare the cost of using MRI to rule out ligamentous injury of the cervical spine with the cost of immobilization in a cervical collar and outpatient follow-up. Neurologically intact and nonobtunded patients with neck pain and normal findings on radiographs evaluated for ligamentous injury of the cervical spine were studied. Patients were either evaluated with MRI or immobilized in a cervical collar and followed up for repeat clinical and radiographic evaluation as outpatients. The authors gathered year 2011 fees from their institution and 2011 Medicare reimbursement data and compared the costs of MRI with the costs of cervical collar and outpatient follow-up. In addition, the median income of the local community was used to estimate opportunity costs associated with cervical collar immobilization. After 7 days of lost wages at the median local income, MRI became a less costly option when comparing hospital fees. Alternatively, when considering Medicare reimbursement, MRI became less costly after only 2 days of lost wages at the median local income. On the basis of these findings, MRI of the cervical spine is less costly than other current management strategies when opportunity costs are considered.
