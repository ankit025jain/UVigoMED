{"id":81272,"title":"Full mouth versus quadrant treatment in chronic periodontitis.","abstract":"The aim of this review is to discuss the evidence for the management of chronic periodontitis, including methods of non-surgical therapy such as full mouth disinfection, full mouth debridement and conventional quadrant-by-quadrant therapy.Manual searches of Medline and Embase databases provided the relevant studies.Multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs) selected for the paper failed to show any significant differences between the quadrant-wise treatment and full mouth debridement and modalities.This review demonstrates that there is no known difference in treatment outcomes between full mouth debridement and traditional quadrant therapy. Further RCTs are necessary to assess clinical effectiveness of chemical adjunct use.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198643","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.646359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.33402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.237411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"}]}
