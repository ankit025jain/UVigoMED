{"id":91940,"title":"Integrin-directed modulation of macrophage responses to biomaterials.","abstract":"Macrophages are the primary mediator of chronic inflammatory responses to implanted biomaterials, in cases when the material is either in particulate or bulk form. Chronic inflammation limits the performance and functional life of numerous implanted medical devices, and modulating macrophage interactions with biomaterials to mitigate this response would be beneficial. The integrin family of cell surface receptors mediates cell adhesion through binding to adhesive proteins nonspecifically adsorbed onto biomaterial surfaces. In this work, the roles of integrin Mac-1 (?M?2) and RGD-binding integrins were investigated using model systems for both particulate and bulk biomaterials. Specifically, the macrophage functions of phagocytosis and inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to a model particulate material, polystyrene microparticles were investigated. Opsonizing proteins modulated microparticle uptake, and integrin Mac-1 and RGD-binding integrins were found to control microparticle uptake in an opsonin-dependent manner. The presence of adsorbed endotoxin did not affect microparticle uptake levels, but was required for the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to microparticles. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that integrin Mac-1 and RGD-binding integrins influence the in vivo foreign body response to a bulk biomaterial, subcutaneously implanted polyethylene terephthalate. A thinner foreign body capsule was formed when integrin Mac-1 was absent (~30% thinner) or when RGD-binding integrins were blocked by controlled release of a blocking peptide (~45% thinner). These findings indicate integrin Mac-1 and RGD-binding integrins are involved and may serve as therapeutic targets to mitigate macrophage inflammatory responses to both particulate and bulk biomaterials.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462356","annotations":[{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Biomaterial","weight":0.804605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.726596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.473927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.441817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.411877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.362855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.168332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Polystyrene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene"},{"name":"Polyethylene terephthalate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"M2 proton channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_proton_channel"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
