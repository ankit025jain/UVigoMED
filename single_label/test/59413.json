{"id":59413,"title":"Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation for the treatment of advanced-stage endometrial cancer.","abstract":"Ccombination chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used for adjuvant treatment of stage III-IV endometrial cancer. The goal of this study was to review the treatment duration, toxicity, and survival for patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation.Women with stage III-IV endometrial cancer treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation between 2006 and 2013 were included. Toxicities were classified per CTCAE v3.0 and RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify treatment and toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival.Fifty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 60 (range 33-85). Thirty-six patients (70.6%) had endometrioid histology, 13 patients (25.5%) had serous, clear cell, or mixed histology, and 2 women (3.9%) had carcinosarcoma. Forty-eight patients had stage III disease and three patients were stage IVB. Mean treatment duration was 107 Â± 19 days. Forty-two patients received all planned chemotherapy, and 16 patients required a dose reduction. Thirty-four patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3-4 toxicities, the majority of which were hematologic. There were no deaths related to therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received leukocyte growth factors, and 25% of patients received a blood transfusion. Seven late grade 3-4 complications occurred: four gastrointestinal and two genitourinary, and one patient had ongoing neuropathy. Median progression-free survival was 42.8 months (range 4.4-81.5 months) and median overall survival was 44.9 months (range 5.1-82.6 months). Three-year overall survival was 80%.Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation is an adequately tolerated treatment modality that allows for shorter treatment duration.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823648","annotations":[{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.892817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.610207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.47113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Carcinosarcoma","weight":0.462222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinosarcoma"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.443799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.227665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Endometrioid tumor","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioid_tumor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Natural satellite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0120813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"}]}
