{"id":36998,"title":"SMARCB1 involvement in the development of leiomyoma in a patient with schwannomatosis.","abstract":"Germline SMARCB1 mutations predispose in schwannomatosis patients to the development of multiple benign schwannomas and, in some cases, meningiomas. Here, we report on a 34-year-old female patient who developed multiple schwannomas at various locations and in addition a leiomyoma of the cervix uteri. She carried a c.362+1G>A mutation that inactivates the donor splice site of exon 3. This mutation caused the schwannomatosis phenotype in this patient and was also demonstrated to be present in her affected mother. The leiomyoma displayed the genetic features that are characteristic for germline SMARCB1 mutation-associated tumors. The mutant allele retained in the tumor, whereas the wild-type allele was lost by loss of heterozygosity. Furthermore, the loss of heterozygosity involved net loss of chromosome 22. An NF2 mutation was not found. However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction suggested that both NF2 copies were lost in the tumor. Immunostaining with a SMARCB1 antibody revealed the mosaic expression pattern that is typical for schwannomatosis-associated tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of leiomyoma associated with a germline SMARCB1 mutation. As such, it widens the spectrum of benign tumors associated with a germline SMARCB1 mutation.
