{"id":52395,"title":"Effect of alphatocopherol on diameter of proximal convoluted tubules of kidney in diabetic mice.","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of alphatocopherol supplement on proximal convoluted tubular diameter of kidney in diabetic mice.The randomised controlled trials was conducted partly at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, and partly in Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, from November 2009 to November 2010. Thirty adult female mice BALB/C were randomly divided into three equal groups. Group A served as the control group. Group B was made diabetic by the intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Group C received injection streptozotocin and was fed with alphatocopherol (vitamin E) supplemented diet. After 12 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and their kidneys were removed for histomorphological study.Diabetes caused significant changes in the diameter of proximal tubule of Experimental Group B (diabetic) compared to the controls in Group A, but these changes were prevented in alphatocopherol treated Group C. Tubular diameter in Group B was significantly reduced compared to theControl Group A (p <0.05), but there was no statistical difference in tubular diameter of Group C and Group A (p > 0.05).Significant difference in proximal tubular diameter of kidneys between diabetic and alphatocopherol treated diabetic mice confirm that vitamin E does extend a protective role in improving diabetic nephropathy.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605713","annotations":[{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.624047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.593047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.559642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.532105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Diabetic nephropathy","weight":0.493682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"United States Army","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"}]}
