{"id":56081,"title":"Mini-cognitive testing in patients with age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To compare Mini-Cognitive (Mini-Cog) Screening test results between patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and age-matched controls.Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups: 56 patients with exudative AMD, mean age of 76 ± 8 years; 82 patients with dry AMD, mean age of 77 ± 9 years; and 91 controls, mean age of 75 ± 8 years.The Mini-Cog test, used to screen patients with early cognitive impairment, was introduced to the three groups of patients at the settings of an ophthalmology outpatient clinic. Test scores were compared between the groups.The mean for the Mini-Cog test scores was 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.15-3.85) for the dry AMD group, 3.95 (95% confidence interval, 3.51-4.39) for the exudative AMD group, and 4.63 (95% confidence interval, 4.45-4.80) for the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the scores of AMD groups, however, both AMD groups received significantly lower scores than controls (P < 0.0001).Patients with age-related macular degeneration in this study demonstrated lower mean scores in the Mini-Cog test than age-matched controls. The Mini-Cog test may be easily applied at an office setting of ophthalmology outpatient clinics, and may help in the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment in the patients with AMD.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756035","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.647143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.194118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"}]}
