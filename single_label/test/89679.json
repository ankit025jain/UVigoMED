{"id":89679,"title":"Rollover car crashes with ejection: a deadly combination--an analysis of 719 patients.","abstract":"Rollover car crashes (ROCs) are serious public safety concerns worldwide.To determine the incidence and outcomes of ROCs with or without ejection of occupants in the State of Qatar.A retrospective study of all patients involved in ROCs admitted to Level I trauma center in Qatar (2011-2012). Patients were divided into Group I (ROC with ejection) and Group II (ROC without ejection).A total of 719 patients were evaluated (237 in Group I and 482 in Group II). The mean age in Group I was lower than in Group II (24.3 ± 10.3 versus 29 ± 12.2; P = 0.001). Group I had higher injury severity score and sustained significantly more head, chest, and abdominal injuries in comparison to Group II. The mortality rate was higher in Group I (25% versus 7%; P = 0.001). Group I patients required higher ICU admission rate (P = 0.001). Patients in Group I had a 5-fold increased risk for age-adjusted mortality (OR 5.43; 95% CI 3.11-9.49), P = 0.001).ROCs with ejection are associated with higher rate of morbidity and mortality compared to ROCs without ejection. As an increased number of young Qatari males sustain ROCs with ejection, these findings highlight the need for research-based injury prevention initiatives in the country.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693231","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.487573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.481203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.395353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.369806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.249403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Qatar","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar"},{"name":"Public safety","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_safety"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"719","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/719"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Rollover","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Rollover (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(film)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Safety of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_particle_collisions_at_the_Large_Hadron_Collider"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
