{"id":84071,"title":"Abnormal chromosome behavior during meiosis in the allotetraploid of Carassius auratus red var. (?)×Megalobrama amblycephala (?).","abstract":"Allopolyploids generally undergo bivalent pairing at meiosis because only homologous chromosomes pair up. On the other hand, several studies have documented abnormal chromosome behavior during mitosis and meiosis in allopolyploids plants leading to the production of gametes with complete paternal or maternal chromosomes. Polyploidy is relatively rare in animals compared with plants; thus, chromosome behavior at meiosis in the allopolyploid animals is poorly understood.Tetraploid hybrids (abbreviated as 4nRB) (4n=148, RRBB) of Carassius auratus red var. (abbreviated as RCC) (2n=100, RR) (?)×Megalobrama amblycephala (abbreviated as BSB) (2n=48, BB) (?) generated gametes of different size. To test the genetic composition of these gametes, the gynogenetic offspring and backcross progenies of 4nRB were produced, and their genetic composition were examined by chromosome analysis and FISH. Our results suggest that 4nRB can produce several types of gametes with different genetic compositions, including allotetraploid (RRBB), autotriploid (RRR), autodiploid (RR), and haploid (R) gametes.This study provides direct evidence of abnormal chromosome behavior during meiosis in an allotetraploid fish.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25178799","annotations":[{"name":"Haploid","weight":0.903101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haploid"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Allopolyploid","weight":0.873695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopolyploid"},{"name":"Meiosis","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Backcrossing","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcrossing"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Gamete","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Homologous chromosome","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_chromosome"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Ploidy","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.611853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.479002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Goldfish","weight":0.444854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Bivalent (genetics)","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalent_(genetics)"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"}]}
