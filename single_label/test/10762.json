{"id":10762,"title":"The involvement of distraction in memory deficits induced by NMDAR antagonism: relevance to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.","abstract":"Recognition memory, impaired in neuropsychiatric conditions and currently untreated, may be assessed by the novel object recognition (NOR) task with robust impairments induced by sub-chronic treatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). The aim of the present study was to investigate how sub-chronic PCP produces its effects in this task. Forty adult female rats received vehicle or PCP (2mg/kg i.p. twice daily for 7 days followed by 7 days washout). Rats completed a 3-min acquisition trial followed by differential inter-trial-interval (ITI) conditions (1 min in the home cage, 10s in the home cage, 1 min in the NOR test box in the presence of an unfamiliar object or 1 min in the NOR test box completely undisturbed) followed by a 3-min retention trial. Control rats spent significantly more time exploring the novel compared with the familiar object in retention. This effect was abolished in the sub-chronic PCP treated animals following all ITI conditions except in rats left completely undisturbed in the NOR test box for a 1 min ITI. The combined influence of sub-chronic PCP treatment and the effect of distraction provides further support for the validity of the NOR test in mimicking cognitive deficits of relevance to schizophrenia.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632009","annotations":[{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Phencyclidine","weight":0.808084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.686541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Cognitive deficit","weight":0.587328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.341966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Object recognition (computer vision)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition_(computer_vision)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Cage (enclosure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Washout (aviation)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washout_(aviation)"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"},{"name":"Distraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Recognition memory","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_memory"}]}
