{"id":67877,"title":"Image segmentation errors correction by mesh segmentation and deformation.","abstract":"Volumetric image segmentation methods often produce delineations of anatomical structures and pathologies that require user modifications. We present a new method for the correction of segmentation errors. Given an initial geometrical mesh, our method semi automatically identifies the mesh vertices in erroneous regions with min-cut segmentation. It then deforms the mesh by correcting its vertex coordinates with Laplace deformation based on local geometrical properties. The key advantages of our method are that: (1) it supports fast user interaction on a single surface rendered 2D view; (2) its parameters values are fixed to the same value for all cases; (3) it is independent of the initial segmentation method, and; (4) it is applicable to a variety of anatomical structures and pathologies. Experimental evaluation on 44 initial segmentations of kidney and kidney vessels from CT scans show an improvement of 83% and 75% in the average surface distance and the volume overlap error between the initial and the corrected segmentations with respect to the ground-truth.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579142","annotations":[{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.649222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Vertex (geometry)","weight":0.433128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.419774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.366157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.362745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.331372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.297784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Polygon mesh","weight":0.24532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.228168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pierre-Simon Laplace","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Deformation (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0153226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
