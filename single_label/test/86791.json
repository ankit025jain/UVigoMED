{"id":86791,"title":"[Evaluation of the antiemetic effect of aprepitant in lung cancer patients receiving carboplatin-based chemotherapy using the Functional Living Index-Emesis questionnaire].","abstract":"In the present study, we evaluated the antiemetic effect of aprepitant in combination with 5-hydroxytryptophan(5-HT3) receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for chemotherapy-induced emesis and nausea in lung cancer patients treated with carboplatin-based systemic chemotherapy using the Functional Living Index-Emesis, an emesis- and nausea-specific quality of life(QOL)questionnaire. Patients experiencing emesis and/or nausea during and/or after previous courses of carboplatin-based chemotherapy received aprepitant in the following treatment cycle with the same anti-cancer agent. Emesis- and nausea-specific QOL aspects were significantly improved with the addition of aprepitant to the existing regimen containing dexamethasone and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Our result suggests that combined antiemetic treatment with aprepitant, dexamethasone, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is more effective in lung cancer patients receiving carboplatin-based systemic chemotherapy than dexamethasone and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743279","annotations":[{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Aprepitant","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprepitant"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.863551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Antiemetic","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiemetic"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"5-HT3 receptor","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT3_receptor"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.52596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.428658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.391214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
