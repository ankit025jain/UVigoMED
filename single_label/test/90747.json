{"id":90747,"title":"Adverse event recording post hip fracture surgery.","abstract":"Accurate recording of adverse events post hip fracture surgery is vital for planning and allocating resources. The purpose of this study was to compare adverse events recorded prospectively at point of care with adverse recorded by the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) System. The study examined a two month period from August to September 2011 at University Hospital Limerick. Out of a sample size of 39, there were 7 males (17.9%) and 32 females (82.1%) with an age range of between 53 and 98 years. The mean age was 80.5 years. 55 adverse events were recorded, in contrast to the HIPE record of 13 (23.6%) adverse events. The most common complications included constipation 10 (18.2%), anaemia 8 (14.5%), urinary retention 8 (14.50%), pneumonia 5 (9.1%) and delirium 5 (9.1%). Of the female cohort, 24 (68.8%) suffered an adverse event, while only 4 (57%) males suffered an adverse event.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579408","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.647165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.60276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.57674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.481923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.458789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.443093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.382264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Delirium","weight":0.316275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.13859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Limerick","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Resource allocation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"}]}
