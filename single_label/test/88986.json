{"id":88986,"title":"[Clinical features in the diagnosis and treatment of ankle fracture with Wagsaffe fragment].","abstract":"To explore the methods in the diagnosis and treatment of ankle fracture with Wagsaffe fragment.Among 1 201 patients, there were 18 cases of concurrent Wagstaffe fractures at our hospital between January 2009 to January 2012. There were 11 males and 7 females with an average of 37.4 (17-54) years. The causes of injuries were fall (n = 10), sports-related injury (n = 4), traffic injury (n = 3) and high-altitude fall (n = 1). All of them had lateral malleolar fracture. Other injuries included internal malleolar fracture (n = 16), posterior malleolar fracture (n = 8) and disruption of medial deltoid ligament (n = 3). According to the Lauge-Hansen system, all fractures were of supination-external rotation type. The fractures of fibula and Wagstaffe were explored through an anterolateral approach. The lateral malleolar fracture was fixed with plate While Wagstaffe fragment secured with lag screw or thread. Disrupted anterior tibiofibular ligament was restored. Other treatments included open reduction and internal fixation of medial and posterior malleolus, repair of medial deltoid ligament and screw fixation of disrupted tibiofibular syndesmosis. Ankle function was evaluated by the Baird-Jackson criteria.Wagstaffe fracture occurred at a rate of 1.5% in ankle fractures. Wagstaffe fracture was found in 4.4% of ankle fracture of supination-external rotation type. Seventeen patients were followed up over an average follow-up period of 16.8 (12-25) months. All radiographs showed union of all fractures and normal mortise. Baird-Jackson ankle functional score was from 81 to 99. In all 17 patients, 9 were rated as excellent, 5 as good and 3 as fair. The excellent and good rate was 87.4%. At the latest follow-up, 14 patients resumed their preinjury activities.As an easily misdiagnosed condition, Wagstaffe fracture is associated with ankle diastase and prone to occur in ankle fracture of supination-external rotation type. Accurate reduction and stable fixation facilitate the restoration of stable syndesmosis in the treatment of ankle fracture with concurrent Wagsaffe fragment.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767297","annotations":[{"name":"Lower extremity of tibia","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_tibia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.798264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Medial ligament of talocrural joint","weight":0.771716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_ligament_of_talocrural_joint"},{"name":"Anterior tibiofibular ligament","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_tibiofibular_ligament"},{"name":"Malleolus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleolus"},{"name":"Syndesmosis","weight":0.742005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndesmosis"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.728081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.56112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.252852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.101834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Inferior tibiofibular joint","weight":0.0550013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_tibiofibular_joint"},{"name":"Deltoid muscle","weight":0.0500884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diastase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastase"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Malleus","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus"},{"name":"1754","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1754"},{"name":"1225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1225"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Mortise and tenon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortise_and_tenon"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Wagstaffe, New South Wales","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagstaffe,_New_South_Wales"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
