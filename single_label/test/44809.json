{"id":44809,"title":"Optimal timing and diagnostic adequacy of hepatocyte phase imaging with gadoxetate-enhanced liver MRI.","abstract":"To evaluate clinical and imaging features associated with adequacy of the hepatocyte phase (HP) in gadoxetate disodium-enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients without chronic liver disease (CLD).This was a retrospective institutional review board-approved study of 97 patients who underwent liver MRI examinations with gadoxetate disodium and had no history of CLD. Available late dynamic and HP sequences (3-20 minutes postinjection) were independently analyzed by four radiologists for perceived image adequacy and level of biliary enhancement. Signal intensity ratios (SIRs) of liver/inferior vena cava (IVC), liver/spleen, and liver/muscle were measured. The Spearman ? and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed correlating various factors with HP adequacy. A rule for predicting HP adequacy was also derived and tested to determine whether overall examination time could be shortened.A visually adequate HP was observed in 12% of subjects by 10 minutes, 80% by 15 minutes, and 93% by 20 minutes. An SIRliver/IVC > 1.8 was the imaging feature that had the strongest correlation with an adequate HP (? = 0.813, P < .001), and was more predictive of adequacy of the HP than the time postinjection (? = 0.5, P < .001). The time at which an adequate HP was first observed did not correlate with any tested demographic or laboratory values. Stopping imaging when an SIRliver/IVC > 1.8 would have successfully reduced mean postcontrast time to 15:39 Â± 4:02 from 20:00 (P < .001), although maintaining HP adequacy.Most patients without CLD undergoing gadoxetate-enhanced liver MRI achieve adequate HP at 20 minutes. However, a shorter postcontrast stopping time can be used in most patients.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717550","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.64808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.532587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.411877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.245853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.204789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Gadoxetic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadoxetic_acid"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Stopping time","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_time"},{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"}]}
