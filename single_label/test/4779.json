{"id":4779,"title":"[Ebola hemorrhagic fever: its extension reflects the African sanitary disaster].","abstract":"Ebola virus, described in 1976 in Zaire, causes severe hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate in humans and nonhuman primates. Epidemics occurred since this time to nowadays in Sudan, Gabon, Congo and currently in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra-Leone, Nigeria and Senegal. Specific treatment and vaccine are not available. So, to prevent the virus transmission with live and dead patients, we must use strict individual and collective measures which are not always understood by local populations and make contact tracing; it is the only way to curb the epidemic.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25362763","annotations":[{"name":"Liberia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Senegal","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal"},{"name":"Gabon","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon"},{"name":"Sudan","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"},{"name":"Ebola","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"},{"name":"Zaire","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaire"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Guinea","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.659502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Viral hemorrhagic fever","weight":0.593124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.573353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.571193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.551744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Contact tracing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing"},{"name":"1976","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
