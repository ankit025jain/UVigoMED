{"id":54370,"title":"Glycaemic control in insulin requiring diabetes patients receiving exclusive enteral tube feeding in an acute hospital setting.","abstract":"Optimising glycaemic control for insulin requiring individuals during enteral feeding is important but difficult. We compare 3 insulin regimens with the aim of improving glucose control and reducing hypoglycaemia.Comparison of 3 insulin/feed regimens: (1) A 20 h feed using a 30:70 premixed insulin (2) Three bolus (4 h) feeds combined with short acting analogue insulin and a basal long acting insulin. (3) A 24 h feed combined with a long acting analogue insulin. The study combined a retrospective analysis of regimen (1) with consecutive prospective analyses of (2) and (3).Glucose concentrations were suboptimal with higher values during the feeds (12.6 mmol/L ± 4.4 vs 10.3 ± 4.1 p<0.001). Although there was no overall difference in glucose control between groups there was a reduction in hypoglycaemia during the feed in the bolus group (no hypoglycaemia during intermittent feeds p<0.001).Glucose concentrations were relatively high overall. Short bolus feeding appears to reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemia. This is of clinical significance for this patient group.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462281","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.637634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.461308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.441073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.253147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.0602563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Enteral","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteral"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0214799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Pareto efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 20","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_20"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 24","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_24"}]}
