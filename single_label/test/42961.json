{"id":42961,"title":"??T17 cells promote the accumulation and expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in human colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Development of cancer has been linked to chronic inflammation, particularly via interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-17 signaling pathways. However, the cellular source of IL-17 and underlying mechanisms by which IL-17-producing cells promote human colorectal cancer (CRC) remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that innate ??T (??T17) cells are the major cellular source of IL-17 in human CRC. Microbial products elicited by tumorous epithelial barrier disruption correlated with inflammatory dendritic cell (inf-DC) accumulation and ??T17 polarization in human tumors. Activated inf-DCs induced ??T17 cells to secrete IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and GM-CSF with a concomitant accumulation of immunosuppressive PMN-MDSCs in the tumor. Importantly, ??T17 cell infiltration positively correlated with tumor stages and other clinicopathological features. Our study uncovers an inf-DC-??T17-PMN-MDSC regulatory axis in human CRC that correlates MDSC-meditated immunosuppression with tumor-elicited inflammation. These findings suggest that ??T17 cells might be key players in human CRC progression and have the potential for treatment or prognosis prediction.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816404","annotations":[{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.813363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.806052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.750443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.730534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.392419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.189179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0501989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"}]}
