{"id":69048,"title":"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin after off pump versus on pump coronary artery surgery.","abstract":"Cardiac surgery.To compare plasma and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (P-/U-NGAL) in on-pump (n?=?43) versus off-pump (n?=?40) surgery.We obtained perioperative P-/U-NGAL and outcome data.P-/U-NGAL increased after surgery. P-NGAL was higher post-surgery in on pump patients (139 versus 67?Âµg L(-1); p?<?0.001), but not at 24?h. There were no differences in U-NGAL. Correlation between P-/U-NGAL and plasma creatinine was weak.P-NGAL acts like a neutrophil activation biomarker and U-NGAL like a tubular injury marker.On-pump patients had greater neutrophil activation. On- versus off-pump surgery had similar impact on tubular cells.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475761","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.769436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.732756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.704516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.685301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.658699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.628955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.42991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lipocalin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipocalin"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_1"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
