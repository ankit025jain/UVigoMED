{"id":70744,"title":"[Long-term follow-ups of comprehensive therapies for stage 4 neuroblastoma].","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term outcomes of childhood stage 4 neuroblastoma (NB) and its correlative prognostic factors.Comprehensive protocols including tumor resection, intensive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, autologous bone marrow transplantation and 13-cis-retinoid were designed and implemented. A total of 112 newly diagnosed NB stage 4 patients at Shanghai Children's Medical Center collected from June 1998 to December 2010 were treated. Their clinical features, therapeutic efficacies, long-term outcomes and prognostic factors were analyzed.There were 69 males and 43 females with an age range of 4 months to 15 years. Among them, 12 improving patients didn't complete treatment because of parental decisions. Among those completing the comprehensive protocols, 62 cases (62.0%) achieved very good partial remission (VGPR), 20 (20.0%) achieved partial remission (PR) while another 18 (18.0%) progressed during treatment. The efficiency rate (including VGPR+PR) of treatment was 82.0 % (n = 82). The median follow-up period was 78 (56, 120) months. And 13 cases were lost after a median follow-up of 16 months. The 2, 3, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 56.2% (59/105) , 40.8% (40/98) and 21.1% (19/90) respectively. Age (>18 months), poor curative effect (achieving no VGPR at the end of treatment), elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (> 5 times normal value), bone marrow involvement and brain metastasis were poor prognostic factors (?(2) = 12.01, 13.66, 6.29, 5.44, 16.18, all P < 0.05) . According to the multivariate estimates of hazards, age, high levels of LDH, poor curative effect and brain metastasis were associated with a worse survival (OR = 3.54, 1.89, 3.08, 3.45, all P < 0.05) . Brain metastasis predicted a worse outcome with 100% mortality rate (n = 6). Compared to traditional chemotherapy, topotecan-based chemotherapy could not improved the efficiency (52.6% (10/19) vs 63.2% (36/57) , P > 0.05) and long-term outcome (2 ys-EFS 42.1% (8/19) vs 56.4% (31/55) , P > 0.05).The prognosis remains poor for neuroblastoma of stage 4. Age (>18 months), poor curative effect (achieving no VGPR at the end of treatment), elevated LDH level (>5 times normal value) and bone marrow infiltration are associated with worse prognosis. Brain metastasis predicts the worst with 100% death rate. Topotecan included chemotherapy can not be proved more effective in this study.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146742","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Topotecan","weight":0.85672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topotecan"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.786849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.757878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.584109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.565767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
