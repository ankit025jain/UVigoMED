{"id":70933,"title":"Cytokine-like molecule CCDC134 contributes to CD8? T-cell effector functions in cancer immunotherapy.","abstract":"CCDC134 is a poorly characterized secreted protein that may act as an immune cytokine. Here, we show that CCDC134 is differentially expressed on resting and activated immune cells and that it promotes CD8(+) T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxicity by augmenting expression of the T-cell effector molecules IFN?, TNF?, granzyme B, and perforin. CCDC134 facilitated infiltration of CD8(+) T cells with enhanced cytolytic activity into tumors, demonstrating strong antitumor effects in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner. Mechanistically, in CD8(+) T cells, exposure to CCDC134 promoted cell proliferation through the JAK3-STAT5 pathway, a classic feature of many cytokines of the common ?-chain (?(c)) cytokine receptor family. Overall, our results provide evidence that CCDC134 may serve as a member of the ?(c) cytokine family and illustrate its potent antitumor effects by augmenting CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immunity.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25125657","annotations":[{"name":"Granzyme","weight":0.91209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granzyme"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Perforin","weight":0.872676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cytolysis","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"STAT5","weight":0.573882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT5"},{"name":"G protein-coupled receptor","weight":0.55071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.525887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.428393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.393729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.355833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"GZMB","weight":0.124933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GZMB"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Cytokine receptor","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_receptor"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Osteonectin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteonectin"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
