{"id":86825,"title":"[Molecular epidemiological analysis of the HIV infection in the Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk Area (Russian Far East)].","abstract":"The results of the molecular-epidemiological analysis of the HIV-1 variants circulating in Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk (Russian Far East) were presented. In Blagoveshchensk HIV-1 IDU-A variants were dominated (92.5%), similar to the regions of the European part of Russia. In Khabarovsk the heterogeneity of circulating HIV-1 variants was noted. In addition to IDU-A variants (66.0%), the strains of subtype B (12.6%), C (4.4%) and recombinant strain form CRF02_AG (17.0%) were identified. Using the phylogenetic analysis method the version of the penetration of HIV-1 variants from China and Japan was not supported.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549465","annotations":[{"name":"Russia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.816519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"China","weight":0.763945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.684781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.537586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Far East","weight":0.496351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.397891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Russian Far East","weight":0.215403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Far_East"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Khabarovsk","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabarovsk"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0565179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Blagoveshchensk","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blagoveshchensk"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"European Russia","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Russia"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
