{"id":81724,"title":"Effect on interleukin-1? and interleukin-8 levels following use of fibrin sealant for periodontal surgery.","abstract":"Fibrin sealant (FS) is a biologically derived tissue adhesive for securing flaps. The aim of the present randomized controlled clinical trial was to compare early wound healing by assessing interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels from gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) after using FS and suture for periodontal flap closure.Thirty selected quadrants in 15 periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to either a test (fibrining) or control group (suturing) for flap closure. IL-1? and IL-8 were assessed in GCF using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before and eight days after surgery. Patients were recalled at 7, 14, 21 days and 3 months after surgery for clinical assessment.There was a statistically significant decrease in IL-1? (84.82 ± 77.18, 29.2 ± 21.97 pg/?l) and IL-8 (57.94 ± 55.47, 21.82 ± 21.93 pg/?l) levels in the test side after fibrining while there was an increase in the control side (IL-1? 31.40 ± 16.82, 128.8 ± 45.14; IL-8 31.40 ± 16.82, 128.83 ± 45.14 pg/?l) (p < 0.05). The change in concentration of IL-1? and IL-8 following intervention correlated significantly in both the sites. Clinical parameters differed significantly only on the seventh day with less plaque and bleeding on the test sites.Fibrin sealant enhances early wound healing by reducing inflammation after periodontal flap surgery.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic
