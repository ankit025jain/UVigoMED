{"id":28124,"title":"The national trend of blood lead levels among Chinese children aged 0-18 years old, 1990-2012.","abstract":"We analyzed the epidemiological data during 1990-2012 that investigated the blood lead level (BLL) in the population aged 0-18 years old in China mainland and provided evidence of the benefits of implementing policies to prevent lead pollution based on the dynamic changes of BLL. Data were collected through databases including China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), CBM disc, Wanfang Data, Pubmed and Medline. The inclusion criteria were: 1. Epidemiological study in healthy population not included studies limited to specific patient; 2. Study subject was not the specific lead exposure population; 3. Sample size should be no less than 100 (for neonatal, no less than 50); 4. BLL detection was under strict quality control; and 5. Results should be presented as BLL (arithmetic mean level or geometric mean level). 62 articles were included in this study. All the surveys in these articles contained 189,352 subjects in 19 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Linear regression analysis showed a significant decrease between 1990 and 2012 with an estimated regression coefficient of 3.05/year (SE=0.01, p<0.001). BLL gradually declined since early 21st century. Median levels of BLL among the three economic zones were 51.4 ?g/L in the eastern zone, 52.72 ?g/L in the central zone and 46.2 ?g/L in the western zone respectively. Median BLLs in male and female population aged 0-18 years old of China were 48.8 ?g/L and 46.1?g/L. Median levels of BLL among the different age ranges were 74.9 ?g/L in newborn, 46.4 ?g/L in 0 to 3 years old, 57.6 ?g/L in 3 to 7 years old and 55.6 ?g/L in above 7 years old respectively. In conclusion, the BLL in the Chinese population of 0-18 years old has gradually dropped in the past 10 years. The decline in temporal trend still remains under potential impacts of several factors such as economical level, gender and age difference. Although, China has made significant achievements in the control prevention of lead pollution, concerted efforts are still warranted to reduce children lead poisoning.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000556","annotations":[{"name":"Regression
