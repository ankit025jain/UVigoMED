{"id":62447,"title":"LMO2 and BCL6 are associated with improved survival in primary central nervous system lymphoma.","abstract":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive sub-variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with morphological similarities to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). While methotrexate (MTX)-based therapies have improved patient survival, the disease remains incurable in most cases and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. We evaluated 69 cases of PCNSL for the expression of HGAL (also known as GCSAM), LMO2 and BCL6 - genes associated with DLBCL prognosis and pathobiology, and analysed their correlation to survival in 49 PCNSL patients receiving MTX-based therapy. We demonstrate that PCNSL expresses LMO2, HGAL(also known as GCSAM) and BCL6 proteins in 52%, 65% and 56% of tumours, respectively. BCL6 protein expression was associated with longer progression-free survival (P = 0·006) and overall survival (OS, P = 0·05), while expression of LMO2 protein was associated with longer OS (P = 0·027). Further research is needed to elucidate the function of BCL6 and LMO2 in PCNSL.
