{"id":30284,"title":"Amelioration of small bowel injury by switching from nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to celecoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: a pilot study.","abstract":"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but have several side effects including mucosal damage in the small intestine. We aimed to evaluate whether the small bowel injury is ameliorated by switching from nonselective NSAIDs to celecoxib in patients with RA.Sixteen patients with RA who were treated with nonselective NSAIDs were enrolled in this study. Nonselective NSAIDs were converted to celecoxib for 12 weeks. Capsule endoscopy was performed before and after treatment with celecoxib. Videos were screened by gastroenterologists blinded to the patients' treatment.Before the administration of celecoxib, reddened folds, denuded areas, petechiae/red spots and mucosal breaks were observed in 63, 63, 88 and 69% of the patients, respectively. In the 14 patients who completed this study, conversion to celecoxib significantly reduced the number of petechiae/red spots, the number of mucosal breaks, and Lewis scores. RA activity and cytokine levels in the peripheral blood were not significantly different before and after treatment with celecoxib.The incidence of small bowel injury by nonselective NSAIDs is high in patients with RA. Conversion from nonselective NSAIDs to celecoxib can be useful for protecting patients with RA from small bowel injury.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526219","annotations":[{"name":"Celecoxib","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.810218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.782785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.423816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.239004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Capsule endoscopy","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_endoscopy"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"}]}
