{"id":61093,"title":"[Significance of regulatory B cells in nosogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia].","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the role of regulatory B cells (Breg) in pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and its clinical significance. A total of 35 ITP patients and 20 normal controls were enrolled in this study. The expression of CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells was detected by flow cytometry and the expression of IL-10 mRNA and TGF-?1 mRNA was assayed by RT-PCR. The results indicated that the expression level of CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells in peripheral blood of newly diagnosed ITP patients was obviously lower than that in normal controls (P < 0.05); the expression level of CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells in ITP patients with increased platelet count after treatment was higher than that before treatment (P < 0.05); the expression level of IL-10 mRNA in newly diagnosed ITP patients was significantly lower than that the in normal controls (P < 0.05), the expression level of TGF-?1 mRNA in newly diagnosed ITP patients increases as compared with normal controls (P < 0.05), after treatment with DXM the expression of IL-10 mRNA was enhanced, the expression of TGF-?1 mRNA was reduced as compared with expression level before treatment (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the Breg cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ITP via humoral immunity and its regulation of T lymphocytes.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763013","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.916951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.861037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.820321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.754566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.751024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Dextromethorphan","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.165815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.133789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"CD24","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD24"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
