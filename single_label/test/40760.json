{"id":40760,"title":"Iatrogenic gastric perforation during laparoscopy presenting on anaesthesia monitor.","abstract":"Unfortunately, in the era of minimal access surgery, visceral injuries due to laparoscopic port insertion are common. Most such injuries are diagnosed on direct vision through a laparoscope camera. We report a case of iatrogenic gastric perforation during laparoscopy, presenting in an unusual way in the form of a very high carbon dioxide output on the anaesthesia monitor. This atypical presentation should be borne in mind while performing laparoscopy.
