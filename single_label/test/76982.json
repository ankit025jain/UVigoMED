{"id":76982,"title":"Haptoglobin 2-2 genotype is associated with TNF- ? and IL-6 levels in subjects with obesity.","abstract":"To evaluate the association between Haptoglobin (HP) gene polymorphisms with inflammatory status in obese subjects.A cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 276 apparently healthy men and nonpregnant obese women were enrolled and allocated according to the HP genotype into the HP (1)/HP (1), HP (2)/HP (1), and HP (2)/HP (2) groups. Distribution of HP genotypes was 49, 87, and 140 for the HP (1)/HP (1), HP (2)/HP (1), and HP (2)/HP (2), respectively. The HP genotype was determined using the polymerase chain reaction method. A multiple linear regression analysis adjusted by age, sex, waist circumference, and total body fat was used to determine the association between HP genotypes with TNF- ? , IL-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels.A multiple linear regression analysis adjusted by sex, waist circumference, and total body fat was performed showing a significant association between the HP (2)/HP (2) genotype and TNF- ? ( ? = 0.180; 95% CI 14.41-159.64, P = 0.01) and IL-6 ( ? = 0.188; 95% CI 1.53-12.72, P = 0.01) levels, but not with hsCRP ( ? = -0.008; 95% CI -1.64-1.47, P = 0.914) levels, whereas the HP (2)/HP (1) genotype showed no association compared with the HP (1)/HP (1) genotype (control group).Results of our study show that the HP (2)/HP (2) genotype is associated with elevated TNF- ? and IL-6, but not with hsCRP, levels in obese subjects.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868113","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.929752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.739776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.717039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.648901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.401224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Haptoglobin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptoglobin"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"641","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/641"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Waistline (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
