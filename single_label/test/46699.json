{"id":46699,"title":"Angiographic embolization is an effective treatment of severe hemorrhage in pancreatitis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to analyze the role of radiologic embolization as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality for severe hemorrhage in pancreatitis.All patients with pancreatitis who underwent mesenteric angiography for a 3-year period were identified and analyzed retrospectively.Nine separate bleeding episodes were treated with embolization (mean age, 56 years). This consisted of 6 patients who underwent primary angiographic embolization, with 3 patients requiring further embolization because of repeated bleeding from a different site. Most patients (83%) had chronic disease. The causative arteries were identified as splenic (6/9 patients), gastroduodenal (1/9 patients), left gastric (1/9 patients), and a small branch of the inferior mesenteric (1/9 patients). Clinical presentations were abdominal pain (3/9 patients), melena (3/9 patients), bleeding into retroperitoneal drain (2/9 patients), and hematemesis (1/9 patients). Bleeding was severe with an average drop in hemoglobin level of 6.3 g/dL. Of the 3 patients who required further embolization, all had splenic artery pseudoaneurysms and 2 patients experienced chronic pancreatitis with necrosis and proven peripancreatic infections. In all cases (9/9 patients), angiography succeeded in identifying and embolizing the causative vessel with a 1-year mortality of 0%.Angiographic embolization is an effective treatment of the life-threatening bleeding that occurs secondary to pancreatitis.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622075","annotations":[{"name":"Melena","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melena"},{"name":"Hematemesis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematemesis"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.695008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.674945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.627397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.464349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Splenic artery","weight":0.323352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenic_artery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.0641452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Inferior mesenteric artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_mesenteric_artery"},{"name":"Gastroduodenal artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroduodenal_artery"},{"name":"Left gastric artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_gastric_artery"}]}
