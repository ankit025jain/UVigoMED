{"id":76396,"title":"[Ecologically-dependent vitamin-minerals insufficiency in the sportsmen's organism].","abstract":"The authors revealed the reduction of saturation of iron, copper, zinc, E and B2 vitamins in sportsmen's organism under high physical exercise. The negative effect was associated with the duration of training - competition cycles. The reduced vitamin-mineral saturation of the organism was associated with the low ferritin level and an imbalance in the hormonal regulation of erythropoiesis. The state of erythropoiesis can be a criterion performance of athletes, whereas a degree of saturation of the body with minerals and vitamins can be the criterion for prenosological diagnosis of their health and professional relevance.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051745","annotations":[{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.843979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.734501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.730684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.509956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.478001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.324057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.302985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.203312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Competition","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Erythropoiesis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoiesis"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Aquifer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"}]}
