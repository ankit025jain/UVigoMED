{"id":67958,"title":"Expression of HMGA2 in bladder cancer and its association with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.","abstract":"High mobility group protein2 (HMGA2) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition are both related to progress of bladder cancer, however, the relationship between HMGA2, E-cadherin and vimentin in bladder cancer is not yet known. Thus, this study has examined expression of HMGA2, E-cadherin and vimentin in bladder cancer and investigated their relationship.The 5637 bladder cancer cell line and SV-HUC-1 normal uroepithelial cells were used to study expression of HMGA2, E-cadherin and vimentin using RT-PCR and western blotting. Paraffin wax-embedded bladder cancer tissues were used to study protein expression using immunohistochemistry and ?(2) analysis and Kendall's correlation were utilized statistical methods.Overexpression of HMGA2 was associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of vimentin in the 5637 bladder cancer line. A total of 49 paraffin wax-embedded tissues of transitional cell bladder cancer were used. Positive expression levels of HMGA2 protein and vimentin were 41 and 43% in bladder tissues, respectively. No expression of E-cadherin was found in 43%. Expression of HMGA2, loss of E-cadherin and expression of vimentin are all significantly correlated with bladder cancer grade and stage. Loss of E-cadherin and expression of vimentin both correlated with recurrence of the bladder cancer.Expression of HMGA2 was closely associated with occurrence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Expression of HMGA2, loss of E-cadherin and expression of vimentin may indicate high degree malignancy of bladder cancer. Loss of E-cadherin expression and positive expression of vimentin may predict recurrence of bladder cancer.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571540","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.746078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.675676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.592811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.380845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.303938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.186132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"HMGA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA"},{"name":"HMGA2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA2"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"High-mobility group","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-mobility_group"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
