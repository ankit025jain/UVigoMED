{"id":13724,"title":"Tissue kallikrein protects rat hippocampal CA1 neurons against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury through the B2R-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway.","abstract":"We have documented that tissue kallikrein (TK) prevents neurons from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury through the B2R-ERK1/2 pathway and the antihypoxic function of TK through Homer1b/c-ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The present study investigates the molecular mechanisms of exogenous TK activation of the B2R-ERK1/2 pathway through the ?-arrestin-2 assembled B2R-Raf-MEK1/2 signaling module in vivo. The cresyl violet staining results indicated that exogenous TK protected the rat hippocampal CA1 neurons against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting (IB) results revealed that exogenous TK upregulated the ?-arrestin-2 assembled B2R-Raf-MEK1/2 signaling module and upregulated the phosphorylation of Raf (p-Raf), MEK1/2 (p-MEK1/2), and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). Meanwhile, exogenous TK upregulated the expression of nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B), depressed the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and bax from mitochondria to the cytosol, and depressed the activation of caspase-3. Take together, our results suggest that exogenous TK attenuated the cerebral I/R induced rat hippocampal CA1 neurons injury through activating the ?-arrestin-2 assembled B2R-Raf-MEK1/2 signaling module and that the activated B2R-Raf-MEK1/2 signaling module could upregulate the expression of NF-?B, decrease the release of cytochrome c and bax from mitochondria to the cytosol, and depress the activation of caspase-3.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464837","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cytochrome c","weight":0.811578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.759366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.736922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.704709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.651115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"C-Raf","weight":0.646864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Raf"},{"name":"Arrestin","weight":0.621716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrestin"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.528197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.429212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.318635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.31087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase","weight":0.258732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
