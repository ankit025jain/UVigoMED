{"id":91300,"title":"Intraocular femtosecond laser use in traumatic cataract.","abstract":"To report the use of femtosecond laser cataract surgery in a traumatic case.A 38-year-old man had a penetrating eye injury while working with wire. The corneal laceration was sutured first. In the postoperative period, cortical cataract appeared in the crystalline lens; therefore, in the second session, cataract surgery was performed using a femtosecond laser system (Alcon-LenSx Lasers Inc.).Corneal incisions, an intact 4.5 mm capsulorhexis, and nucleus liquefaction were performed with the femtosecond laser. Corrected distance visual acuity was 0.9 1 month after surgery.Femtosecond laser is an effective method in traumatic cataract cases after penetrating eye injury. Corneal incisions, capsulorhexis, and nucleus liquefaction can be performed precisely and safety.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519509","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.689777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.52611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.482172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.444178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.343716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.197796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Eye injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_injury"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Laceration","weight":0.125409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laceration"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Liquefaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefaction"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"}]}
