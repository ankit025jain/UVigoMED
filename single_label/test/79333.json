{"id":79333,"title":"Differential expression of 11?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and 2 in mild and moderate/severe persistent allergic nasal mucosa and regulation of their expression by Th2 cytokines: asthma and rhinitis.","abstract":"Glucocorticoids are used to treat allergic rhinitis, but the mechanisms by which they induce disease remission are unclear. 11?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11?-HSD) is a tissue-specific regulator of glucocorticoid responses, inducing the interconversion of inactive and active glucocorticoids.We analysed the expression and distribution patterns of 11?-HSD1, 11?-HSD2, and steroidogenic enzymes in normal and allergic nasal mucosa, and cytokine-driven regulation of their expression. The production levels of cortisol in normal, allergic nasal mucosa and in cultured epithelial cells stimulated with cytokines were also determined.The expression levels of 11?-HSD1, 11?-HSD2, steroidogenic enzymes (CYP11B1, CYP11A1), and cortisol in normal, mild, and moderate/severe persistent allergic nasal mucosa were assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. The expression levels of 11?-HSD1, 11?-HSD2, CYP11B1, CYP11A1, and cortisol were also determined in cultured nasal epithelial cell treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, and IFN-?. Conversion ratio of cortisone to cortisol was evaluated using siRNA technique, 11?-HSD1 inhibitor, and the measurement of 11?-HSD1 activity.The expression levels of 11?-HSD1, CYP11B1, and cortisol were up-regulated in mild and moderate/severe persistent allergic nasal mucosa. By contrast, 11?-HSD2 expression was decreased in allergic nasal mucosa. In cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17A, 11?-HSD1 expression and activity increased in parallel with the expression levels of CYP11B1 and cortisol, but the production of 11?-HSD2 decreased. CYP11A1 expression level was not changed in allergic nasal mucosa or in response to stimulation with cytokines. SiRNA technique or the measurement of 11?-HSD1 activity showed that nasal epithelium activates cortisone to cortisol in a 11?-HSD-dependent manner.These results indicate that the localized anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are regulated by inflammatory cytokines, which can modulate the expression of 11?-HSD1, 11?-HSD2, and CYP11B1, and by the intracellular concentrations of bioactive glucocorticoids.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447082","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin
