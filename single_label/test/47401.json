{"id":47401,"title":"Management of systolic blood pressure after endoscopic submucosal dissection is crucial for prevention of post-ESD gastric bleeding.","abstract":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a useful technique for early gastric neoplasms without lymph node metastasis. However, a critical complication is unpredictable post-ESD bleeding. Some risk factors for post-ESD bleeding have been reported previously, although those risk factors have not directly contributed toward prevention of post-ESD bleeding.We retrospectively identified 186 gastric neoplasms in 183 consecutive patients treated with ESD from 2005 to 2012 at Nagoya City University Hospital, and divided them into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of post-ESD bleeding.Of the 186 lesions, eight lesions (4.2%) developed post-ESD bleeding. Univariate analysis identified hypertension (38.8% in nonbleeding vs. 87.5% in bleeding; P=0.009) and depressed-type tumors (26.4% in nonbleeding vs. 62.5% in bleeding; P=0.040) as significantly related to the incidence of post-ESD bleeding. On multivariate analysis, hypertension (odds ratio, 11.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-111.66; P=0.034) and depressed-type tumors (odds ratio, 5.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-25.73; P=0.036) were independent risk factors for post-ESD bleeding. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) after ESD was significantly higher in the post-ESD bleeding group than in the post-ESD non-bleeding group (P=0.021), with the comorbidity of hypertension significantly correlating with SBP after ESD (?=0.332, P<0.001).Control of SBP after ESD is important for the prevention of post-ESD bleeding because hypertension as a comorbidity, which is associated positively with SBP after ESD, is a significant risk factor for post-ESD bleeding.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589830","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.617026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.380041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.337411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.23732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Internal bleeding","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_bleeding"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"}]}
