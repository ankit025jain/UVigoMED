{"id":87435,"title":"[Clavicular hook plate combined with suture anchor for the treatment of type Tossy III chronic acromioclavicular dislocation].","abstract":"To observe the clinical effects of clavicular hook plate combined with suture anchor in treating type Tossy III chronic acromioclavicular dislocation.From January 2008 to December 2012,18 patients with type Tossy III chronic acromioclavicular dislocation were treated with clavicular hook plate and suture anchor. There were 12 males and 6 females, aged from 20 to 56 years old with an average of 31.5 years. Ten cases were left dislocation and 8 cases were right dislocation. Operation time was 3 weeks to 4 months after injury with a mean of 1.8 months. Functional exercise was adopted 2 weeks after operation. And Karlsson standard was used to evaluate curative effect.All patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months with an average of 16 months. According to Karlsson standard, 17 cases were excellent and 1 was poor.Clavicular hook plate combined with suture anchor can repair conoid ligament and trapezoid ligament in treating type Tossy III chronic acromioclavicular dislocation, and had advantages of simple operation, less trauma, stable fixation, it can obtain satisfactory effects.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167678","annotations":[{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.471708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.176249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Acromioclavicular joint","weight":0.0994991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromioclavicular_joint"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trapezoid ligament","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid_ligament"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Trapezoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid"},{"name":"Conoid ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conoid_ligament"},{"name":"Conoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conoid"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Karlsson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsson"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"}]}
