{"id":89558,"title":"Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction with bioactive synthetic ligament is an option. A 3-year follow-up study.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate mid-term follow-up results of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction using a bioactive synthetic ligament in the treatment of objective patellofemoral (PF) instability.Sixteen patients (18 knees) presenting with objective PF instability underwent a MPFL reconstruction, isolated or associated with other surgical procedures for PF stabilization. All patients were clinically evaluated at a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Kujala, subjective IKDC and KOOS scores were used to assess clinical outcome. Pre-operative and post-operative pain was quantified with VAS scale and the overall satisfaction graded according to Insall and Crosby. Although none of the patients in this series were involved in high-level sports activity because of patellofemoral instability, activity level pre-operatively and at follow-up were evaluated according to Tegner scale.No recurrence of dislocation was observed in this series. The overall satisfaction rate was 88.8%. Kujala score improved significantly from 57±8.4 to 84.3±10.2 points (p<.01). Both subjective IKDC (42.4±7.13 to 70.1±3.9) and KOOS (62.7±4.34 to 82.8±8.8) significantly improved from pre-operative evaluation (p<.01). VAS decreased from a mean pre-operative value of 2.5±1.6 to 1.4±1.5 at 3 years follow-up. Only one patient required revision debridement surgery for persistent medial epicondylar pain.Isolated or associated MPFL reconstruction with bioactive synthetic ligament is a valid option in surgical treatment of objective PF instability, with results at mid-term follow-up comparable to autologous graft, thus minimizing donor-site morbidity and associated complications.IV.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705792","annotations":[{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.822455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.481647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.451722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.364424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.332627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.229839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.159287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.127493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.105305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"578","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/578"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_3"}]}
