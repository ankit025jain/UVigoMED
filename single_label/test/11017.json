{"id":11017,"title":"Transarticular fixation with cortical screws combined with dorsal laminectomy and partial discectomy as surgical treatment of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis in 17 dogs: clinical and computed tomography follow-up.","abstract":"To describe clinical outcome and technical outcome assessed using computed tomography (CT) in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLSS) treated by dorsal laminectomy, partial discectomy, and transarticular screw fixation.Retrospective observational case series.Dogs with DLSS (n = 17).Dogs with neurologic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings compatible with DLSS treated by dorsal laminectomy, partial discectomy and transarticular screw fixation were enrolled. Pre- and postoperative neurologic status was compared. Lumbosacral (LS) angle in extension and misalignment in preoperative MRI were compared with the postoperative CT. Residual mobility of the LS joint after fixation was also evaluated. Status of screws, presence of new bone formation over screw heads/articular facets and presence of adjacent segment disease (ASD) were assessed.Median CT follow-up was 12 months. Clinical improvement was seen in 13 dogs, 2 dogs had intermittent LS pain, and 2 dogs needed revision surgery. In 5 dogs, screws were either pulled out or broken. Reduction of LS angle in extension and misalignment was achieved. Residual mobility of the LS segment was present and ASD was not recognized.Transarticular screw fixation in dogs with DLSS is associated with a considerable number of technical failures and does not result in rigid stabilization; however, this did not significantly adversely influence clinical outcome.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617599","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.803296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.744587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.54354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.535781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Laminectomy","weight":0.428352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminectomy"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.265165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.220694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Discectomy","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discectomy"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Zygapophysial joint","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygapophysial_joint"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"}]}
