{"id":68603,"title":"Discovery of 2-(1H-indazol-1-yl)-thiazole derivatives as selective EP(1) receptor antagonists for treatment of overactive bladder by core structure replacement.","abstract":"We have designed a series of potent EP1 receptor antagonists. These antagonists are a series of 2-(1H-indazol-1-yl)-thiazoles in which the core structure was replaced with pyrazole-phenyl groups. In preliminary conscious rat cystometry experiments, two representative candidates, 2 and 22, increased bladder capacity. In particular, the increase using 22 was approximately 2-fold that of the baseline. More detailed profiling of this compound and further optimization of this series promises to provide a novel class of drug for treating overactive bladder (OAB).
