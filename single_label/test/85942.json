{"id":85942,"title":"Pressure chamber tests of eustachian tube function document lower efficiency in adults with colds when compared to without colds.","abstract":"Fractional gradient equilibrated (FGE) for ears with applied positive but not negative middle ear (ME)-ambient pressure gradients is highly sensitive to a cold-like illness (CLI).The sequential development of eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction, ME under-pressure, and otitis media (OM) characterizes many children during a CLI. If linked, OM burden would be lessened by interventions that promote/preserve good ET function during a CLI. Evaluating this requires a quantitative ET function test for MEs with an intact tympanic membrane responsive to a CLI.Pressure chamber testing of ET function was performed at +200 and -200 daPa in 3 groups of adults: group I, 21 subjects with an extant CLI and groups II and III, 14 and 57 adults, respectively, without a CLI. ME-chamber pressure gradient was recorded by tympanometry before and after the subject swallowed twice. ET functional efficiency was quantified as the FGE, which was then compared among groups using a Mann-Whitney U test.At chamber pressures of 200 daPa, the ME-chamber pressure gradient was negative, and FGE was low and not different among groups. At chamber pressures of -200 daPa that gradient was positive, and FGE was significantly higher in groups II and III when compared with group I.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834936","annotations":[{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Tympanometry","weight":0.297819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanometry"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.24992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Pressure vessel","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_vessel"},{"name":"Order of Merit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Merit"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Thermodynamic equilibrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Mastoid antrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_antrum"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Extant taxon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon"},{"name":"Fruit Growers Express","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_Growers_Express"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
