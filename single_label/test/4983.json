{"id":4983,"title":"Management of fractures in a geriatric surgical patient.","abstract":"Trauma is an increasingly common problem in geriatric patients; fractures are frequent among the elderly. Life expectancy continues to rise. Advances in medical care allow people to live longer and better lives. Medications, surgical advances (treatment for coronary artery disease, coronary bypass grafting), and joint replacement surgery can be safely performed in elderly patients. Thus, geriatric patients are no longer confined to a life of inactivity. They are out of their homes and interacting in the community, exercising and leading active lives. Thus, they are more likely to become injured and present to trauma centers for care.
