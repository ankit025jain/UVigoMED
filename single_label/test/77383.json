{"id":77383,"title":"All part of the job? The contribution of the psychosocial and physical work environment to health inequalities in Europe and the European health divide.","abstract":"This study is the first to examine the contribution of both psychosocial and physical risk factors to occupational inequalities in self-assessed health in Europe. Data from 27 countries were obtained from the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey for men and women aged 16 to 60 (n = 21,803). Multilevel logistic regression analyses (random intercept) were applied, estimating odds ratios of reporting less than good health. Analyses indicate that physical working conditions account for a substantial proportion of occupational inequalities in health in both Central/Eastern and Western Europe. Physical, rather than psychosocial, working conditions seem to have the largest effect on self-assessed health in manual classes. For example, controlling for physical working conditions reduced the inequalities in the prevalence of\"less than good health\" between the lowest (semi- and unskilled manual workers) and highest (higher controllers) occupational groups in Europe by almost 50 percent (Odds Ratio 1.87, 95% Confidence Interval 1.62-2.16 to 1.42, 1.23-1.65). Physical working conditions contribute substantially to health inequalities across \"post-industrial\" Europe, with women in manual occupations being particularly vulnerable, especially those living in Central/Eastern Europe. An increased political and academic focus on physical working conditions is needed to explain and potentially reduce occupational inequalities in health.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919305","annotations":[{"name":"Western Europe","weight":0.615849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.59483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.50138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.433997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.427004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.310119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.229649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0835889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"622","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/622"},{"name":"803","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/803"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Zero of a function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Bilevel rail car","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilevel_rail_car"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"Post-industrial society","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-industrial_society"}]}
