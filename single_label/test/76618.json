{"id":76618,"title":"Evaluation of vitamins A, C and E content in diets of adolescents living in Warsaw, Poland.","abstract":"Antioxidant vitamins such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and beta-carotene (provitamin A), play a significant role in protecting the body from an excess of free radicals. The vitamin content of the diet is thus very important.To assess whether the dietary intake of vitamins A, C and E is adequate in a selected group of adolescents living in Warsaw.The mean vitamin consumption was estimated using three-day dietary records whilst vitamin contents of selected foodstuffs were obtained from Food Composition Tables. Both were related to Polish nutrition standards applied to adolescents; i.e. EAR (Estimated Average Requirement) for vitamins A and C and AI (Adequate Intake) for vitamin E.Dietary vitamin C in adolescents and vitamin E in girls were around 18-25% lower than that recommended. Diets that were deficient in vitamins C and E were recorded in 47% to 67% adolescents.It is therefore necessary to increase the consumption of vegetables and fruit which provide a valuable dietary source for these vitamins.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964575","annotations":[{"name":"Ascorbic acid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid"},{"name":"Beta-Carotene","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Carotene"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Dietary Reference Intake","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake"},{"name":"Carotene","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotene"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.731771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.645629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.525353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Dieting","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Warsaw","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"},{"name":"Provitamin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provitamin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"}]}
