{"id":52176,"title":"Home urine C-peptide creatinine ratio can be used to monitor islet transplant function.","abstract":"Islet graft function is defined by serum C-peptide in a standardized challenge test. We assessed whether urine C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR) sent from home could provide a viable alternative.Seventeen islet recipients provided 90-min serum C-peptide (sCP90) and 120-min UCPCR (UCPCR120) samples during 68 interval posttransplant mixed-meal tolerance tests, also posting from home a 120-min postbreakfast UCPCR sample every 2 weeks. UCPCR was compared with a clinical score of islet function, derived from HbA1c and insulin dose.UCPCR120 and mean home postmeal UCPCR were strongly correlated with sCP90 (r(s) = 0.73, P < 0.001; and rs = 0.73, P < 0.01, respectively). Mean home UCPCR increased with clinical score (r(s) = 0.75; P < 0.001) and with graft function defined both by sCP90 >200 pmol/L and insulin independence. UCPCR cutoffs to detect insulin independence and poor graft function were sensitive and specific.Home UCPCR provides a valid measure of C-peptide production in islet transplant recipients.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623023","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.169978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.15904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.144092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.0332281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0332009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"American Revolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"},{"name":"Strongly correlated material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
