{"id":18896,"title":"[The diagnostic value of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique in detection of anti-tuberculosis antibodies in groups of patients with HIV-positive and HIV-negative reaction].","abstract":"The article analyzes the results of evaluation of diagnostic value of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antituberculosis antibodies with purpose to diagnose tuberculosis of lungs separately in groups of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative persons. A moderate diagnostic value of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is established under screening for tuberculosis of lungs in HIV-negative patients. The evidence of reliability of results depended mainly of actual form of tuberculosis of lungs. In view of many positive results in detection of anti-tuberculosis antibodies in control group of patients with HIV-infection the data testified the low diagnostic significance of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in group of patients with HIV-infection. The drawbacks of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique of diagnostic of tuberculosis of lungs in common group of HIV-infected patients partially compensated by possibility of its application at late stages of development of HIV-infection.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757864","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.726325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.295655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.293686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.159466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
