{"id":62117,"title":"BCR/ABL level at 6 months identifies good risk CML subgroup after failing early molecular response at 3 months following imatinib therapy for CML in chronic phase.","abstract":"It is unclear if patients with CML treated with imatinib who fail to achieve BCR/ABL transcript levels <10%(IS) at 3 months i.e. an early molecular response (EMR) have a better prognosis if they achieve a response by 6 months. We reviewed 320 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase receiving Imatinib therapy with 3 and 6 month BCR/ABL transcript levels available, and divided them into four groups. Group I (achieved an EMR at 3 months), Group II (did not achieve an EMR at 3 months, but achieved a transcript level of <1% at 6 months), Group III (did not achieve an EMR at 3 months, then at 6 months achieved a level between 1% and 10%) and Group IV (failed to achieve a response at 3 and 6 months). Compared to Group I, Group IV showed significantly worse freedom from treatment failure (FTF; 93.1% vs 69.0%, P < 0.001), progression free survival (97.7% vs 77.3%, P < 0.001) and overall survival (98.3% vs 78.9%, P < 0.001). While, group III showed inferior PFS (98.3% vs 90.4%, P = 0.013) and OS (97.7% vs 90.4%, P = 0.037), but no difference in FTF (93.1% vs 92.0%, P = 0.520). There were no significant differences between Groups I and II. A BCR/ABL transcript level at 6 months can identify a \"good-risk\" subgroup among patients who fail to achieve an EMR on Imatinib therapy for CML.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619861","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.368006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.134255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Political freedom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Insertion sequence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sequence"},{"name":"Boron group","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group"}]}
