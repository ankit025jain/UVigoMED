{"id":12603,"title":"[Changes of CCK-8, CGRP, SP, and VIP in the colon and the lung tissue of allergic asthma model rats: an experimental observation].","abstract":"To observe changes of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in each tissue of the digestive system of allergic asthma (AA) model rats.The pulmonary disease (AA) rat model was duplicated by 1% ovalbumin. Its effect on the pathological morphology of the six main parts of the digestive system (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum) and related regulating factors such as CCK8, CGRP, SP, and VIP were observed.The pathological morphology of the lung was synchronously changed as that of the colon of model rats. But there was no obvious change in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, or rectum. Significant changes occurred in CCK8 (79 961.4 +/- 12 577.9, 48 519.5 +/- 12 240.7), CGRP (41 950.1 +/- 12 600.1, 38 059.8 +/- 11 942.4), and SP (88 243.9 +/- 32 177.2, 47 417.8 +/- 16 462.4), and VIP (20 711.4 +/- 7 334.6, 43 208.1 +/- 13 433.8) of the lung tissue and the colon tissue of model rats (P < 0. 05, P < 0.01). But there was no significant change in the aforesaid substances of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and rectum (P > 0.05).Pulmonary disease might affect the colon, inducing pathological changes of the colon tissue and changes of related regulating factors such as CCK8, CGRP, SP, and VIP. It showed no significant effect on the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and rectum.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517067","annotations":[{"name":"Substance P","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Vasoactive intestinal peptide","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.898571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Calcitonin","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.756556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.725371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.485881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.476191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Calcitonin gene-related peptide","weight":0.406881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin_gene-related_peptide"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
