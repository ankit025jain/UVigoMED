{"id":18407,"title":"Preventing biofilm formation and associated occlusion by biomimetic glycocalyxlike polymer in central venous catheters.","abstract":"The use of catheters and other implanted devices is constantly increasing in modern medicine. Although catheters improve patients' healthcare, the hydrophobic nature of their surface material promotes protein adsorption and cell adhesion. Catheters are therefore prone to complications, such as colonization by bacterial and fungal biofilms, associated infections, and thrombosis. Here we describe the in vivo efficacy of biologically inspired glycocalyxlike antiadhesive coatings to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization on commercial totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAPs) in a clinically relevant rat model of biofilm infection. Although noncoated TIVAPs implanted in rats were heavily colonized by the 2 biofilm-forming pathogens with a high percentage of occlusion, coating TIVAPs reduced their initial adherence and subsequently led to 4-log reduction in biofilm formation and reduced occlusion. Our antiadhesive approach is a simple and generalizable strategy that could be used to minimize clinical complications associated with the use of implantable medical devices.
