{"id":61089,"title":"[Recent advances on diagnosis and therapy of lymphoproliferative disorders after allo-HSCT].","abstract":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders(PTLD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are a group of rare, but are grievous complications. The occurrence of these diseases are most associated with EBV infection. The clinical manifestations usually include recurrent fever, lymph node enlargement, progressive decline of three lineage cells of hemogram, EB viremia and response failure to formal broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy, then the disease rapidly deteriorated in the short term, which result in high mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis and timely effective treatment such as rituximab, donor lymphocyte infusion and/or EB virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are needed to improve the prognosis. This review briefly summarized the diagnosis and therapy advance on the lymphoproliferative disorders after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763039","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.881128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.812059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.791812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.786849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.754566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.594222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.345291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.150053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
