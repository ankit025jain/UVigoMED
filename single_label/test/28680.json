{"id":28680,"title":"Factors related to psychosocial barriers to drug treatment among Chinese drug users.","abstract":"Although substance abuse treatment has been considerably scaled up in China, impediments to accessing these services remain among drug users. The authors examine the primary psychosocial barriers to drug treatment in this population and evaluate factors associated with these barriers. Barriers to accessing drug treatment were measured using the Barriers to Treatment Inventory (BTI). A Structural Equation Model was used to examine whether the internal barriers were associated with treatment history and frequent methamphetamine use as well as how demographic characteristics influence such barriers. We found four primary factors of internal barriers to drug treatment--absence of problem, negative social support, fear of treatment, and privacy concerns--to fit well. Demographic factors, notably age and employment status, indirectly influence barriers to treatment via other factors. Frequency of methamphetamine use and drug treatment history are directly associated with the absence of problem and negative social support dimensions of the BTI, and it is through these pathways that demographic factors such as age and employment status shape barriers to treatment. The findings indicate that perceived absence of a problem and negative social support are the barriers most influenced by the personal domains of Chinese drug users' lives. Efforts to engage drug users in China about drug treatment options may consider how these barriers are differentially perceived in order to effectively reach this population.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813554","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.717769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.582941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.581648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Privacy","weight":0.557881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.405357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"History","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.234793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.234465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.176389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.15273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.145929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
