{"id":25746,"title":"[Adenosine triphosphate stress (99m)Tc-MIBI single-photon emission computed tomography in the diagnosis Miocardial Iscemia in patients with Microvascular Angina].","abstract":"To assess diagnostic potential of (99m)Tc-MIBI-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with intravenous adenosine triphosphate (ATP) infusion in comparison with exercise stress (EX) SPECT in patients with microvascular angina.Patients with angina, positive exercise test and normal coronary angiogram (n=25) were included in the study. Patients underwent a three-phase (99m)Tc-MIBI-SPECT scan: at rest, exercise stress test and pharmacological stress with ATP infusion. Perfusion was graded on scale of 0-4.EX- and ATP-SPECT images showed mild reversible perfusion defects in 43 and 50%, moderate - in 19 and 12.5%, severe - in 5 and 16.7% of patients, respectively.Our results demonstrate that adenosine triphosphate stress (99m)Tc-MIBI-SPECT is comparable with exercise (99m)Tc-MIBI-SPECT in detection of ischemia and may be useful tool for diagnosing microvascular angina.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177807","annotations":[{"name":"Single-photon emission computed tomography","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.725046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Cardiac stress test","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_stress_test"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.585775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.444226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Microangiopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microangiopathy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
