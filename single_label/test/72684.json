{"id":72684,"title":"Increased cardio and cerebrovascular mortality in breast cancer patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy--25 year follow-up of a randomised trial from the South Sweden Breast Cancer Group.","abstract":"To analyse late morbidity and mortality in pre and post-menopausal breast cancer patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy, with emphasis on side-effects from the heart, cerebrovascular and respiratory systems.Long term follow-up of two randomised, clinical trials with 1100 patients was carried out. Pre-menopausal women were allocated to radiotherapy (RT), RT+oral cyclophosphamide (RT+C) or cyclophosphamide only (C). Post-menopausal women were allocated to RT, RT+Tamoxifen for one year (RT+Tam) or tamoxifen only (Tam). Information on admission to hospital, mortality and causes of death was obtained from national registers.After 25 years, adding RT to cyclophosphamide in pre-menopausal women raised the mortality from heart disease from zero to 0.8% (p=0.04). In post-menopausal women, adding RT to Tam raised the mortality from heart disease from 10.5% to 18.4% (p=0.005). In post-menopausal women mortality due to cerebrovascular disease increased from 3.4% to 8.7% by adding RT to Tam (p=0.015). The differences were not evident until in the second decade of follow-up. In spite of differences in specific causes of death, there were no significant differences between the treatment arms concerning morbidity or overall mortality.Postmastectomy radiotherapy to the chest wall and loco-regional lymph nodes including the parasternal lymph nodes as delivered in the end of the seventies did not reduce overall mortality, but gave a significantly increased risk of death from heart and cerebrovascular disease, which appeared during the second decade after radiotherapy.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951164","annotations":[{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.813295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.809192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.710297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.64351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.507173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.375548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.300189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"1970s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"}]}
