{"id":30489,"title":"Temporal profile of fronto-striatal-limbic activity during implicit decisions in drug dependence.","abstract":"Substance dependence is associated with impaired decision-making and altered fronto-striatal-limbic activity. Both greater and lesser brain activity have been reported in drug users compared to controls during decision-making. Inconsistent results might be explained by group differences in the temporal profile of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response. While most previous studies model a canonical hemodynamic response, a finite impulse response (FIR) model measures fMRI signal at discrete time points without assuming a temporal profile. We compared brain activity during decision-making and feedback in substance users and controls using two models: a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and a FIR model.37 substance-dependent individuals (SDI) and 43 controls performed event-related decision-making during fMRI scanning. Brain activity was compared across group using canonical HRF and FIR models.Compared to controls, SDI were impaired at decision-making. The canonical HRF model showed that SDI had significantly greater fronto-striatal-limbic activity during decisions and less activity during feedback than controls. The FIR model confirmed greater activity in SDI during decisions. However, lower activity in SDI during feedback corresponded to a lower post-stimulus undershoot of the hemodynamic response.Greater activity in fronto-striatal-limbic pathways in SDI compared to controls is consistent with prior work, further supporting the hypothesis that abnormalities in these circuits underlie impaired decision-making. We demonstrate for the first time using FIR analysis that lower activity during feedback may simply reflect the tail end of the hemodynamic response to decision, the post-stimulus undershoot, rather than an actual difference in feedback response.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491458","annotations":[{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.901657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Impulse response","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Finite impulse response","weight":0.595754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.477225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.34813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Electrical network","weight":0.257573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.246445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Discrete time","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time"},{"name":"Frequency response","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0814058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Haemodynamic response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemodynamic_response"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Ordinary differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation"},{"name":"Discrete mathematics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Dirac delta function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function"},{"name":"Canon (fiction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Croatian Radio Festival","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radio_Festival"},{"name":"Overshoot (signal)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(signal)"},{"name":"Finite group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_group"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"}]}
