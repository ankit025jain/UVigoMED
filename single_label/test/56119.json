{"id":56119,"title":"Iris concavity, corneal biomechanics, and their correlations with ocular biometry in a cohort of 10- to 12-year-old UK school boys: baseline data.","abstract":"Pigment dispersion syndrome is associated with iris concavity. This study investigated the prevalence of iris concavity, defined as a measurement of ?-0.1 mm, in a cohort of 10- to 12-year-old boys, and explored the relationship between iris curvature and anterior segment biometry. Associations with corneal biomechanical parameters also were explored.A cohort of school boys (n = 96) was recruited from a local school. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was performed under accommodative and nonaccommodative conditions, and iris curvature quantified. Corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were measured with the ocular response analyzer (ORA). Noncontact axial biometry was performed using laser interferometry.The prevalence of iris concavity was 24% on distance fixation, increasing to 65% on accommodation. Variables significantly associated with nonaccommodating iris curvature were lens vault (P = 0.02) and mean keratometry (P = 0.02). For both variables acting jointly, R(2) = 0.30. Variables associated significantly with accommodating iris curvature were anterior chamber depth (P = 0.009), lens vault (P = 0.049), and mean scleral spur angle (P < 0.0001). For these three variables acting jointly, R(2) = 0.33. Significant association was found between CH and spur-to-spur distance (R(2) = 0.07, P = 0.025).Iris concavity was a common finding in this cohort and related to anterior segment biometric parameters. Further work is required to clarify whether anatomical differences exist between iris concavity seen in the adolescent eye and that found in adults with pigment dispersion syndrome.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744208","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.778467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Interferometry","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.604882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.603195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Pigment dispersion syndrome","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment_dispersion_syndrome"},{"name":"Biostatistics","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.312605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Accommodation (eye)","weight":0.297809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_(eye)"},{"name":"Dispersion (optics)","weight":0.297796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hysteresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis"},{"name":"Keratometer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratometer"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"}]}
