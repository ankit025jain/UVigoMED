{"id":47095,"title":"Eye diseases in children in Jordan.","abstract":"To investigate eye diseases in children in Jordan and to see whether it is necessary to conduct a visual screening programme.The study was conducted between July 2010 and July 2012 at four Royal Medical Service hospitals located in northern, eastern, middle and southern parts of Jordan. Children aged (6-14 years) attending paediatric clinics for various reasons were enrolled. Ophthalmologic assessment included visual acuity and anterior and posterior segment examination. Patients with visual acuity of less than 20/20 underwent refraction under cyclopegia.Of the 3200 children in the study ocular abnormalities were found in 366 (11.4%); 312 (9.8%) had visual acuity less than 20/20 in one or both eyes. Refractive error was seen in 286 (8.9%); while vernal catarrh was the second most common ocular abnormality with 51 (1.6%) patients followed by squint 16(0.5%). Four (0.12%) patients had severe visual impairment and one (0.03%) patient was blind.The prevalence of refractive error was high in school children in the study area. It is important to conduct a visual screening programme in early school years in order to prevent amblyopia.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605705","annotations":[{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.821727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.79695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.777836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.662609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.650261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.487269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Catarrh","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catarrh"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"286","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/286"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"32nd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32nd_century_BC"},{"name":"Spring (season)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)"},{"name":"Early Buddhist schools","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Buddhist_schools"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mexican general election, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_general_election,_2012"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Jordan","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Minuscule 614","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_614"}]}
