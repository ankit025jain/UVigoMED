{"id":52249,"title":"Prepregnancy body mass index and weight change on postpartum diabetes risk among gestational diabetes women.","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of prepregnancy BMI and weight change from prepregnancy to postpartum on postpartum type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk among women with gestational diabetes (GDM).A retrospective cohort study in 1,263 GDM women at 1-5 years after delivery was performed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association of prepregnancy BMI and weight change with T2D and prediabetes risks.The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios based on different levels of prepregnancy BMI (<23, 23-24.9, 25-29.9, and ?30 kg/m(2) ) were 1.00, 1.77, 2.35, and 6.54 (Ptrend ?<?0.001) for incident T2D, and 1.00, 1.46, 1.87, and 1.79 (Ptrend ?<?0.001) for incident prediabetes, respectively. Compared with women with stable weight (Â±3 kg), those with weight gain ?7 kg had an 86% and a 32% increased risk of diabetes and prediabetes, and those with weight loss ?3 kg had a 45% decreased risk of prediabetes. The positive associations of prepregnancy BMI with incident diabetes and prediabetes risk were persistent in women with different levels of weight change (<3 kg and ?3 kg).Prepregnancy obesity and excessive weight gain from prepregnancy to postpartum increase postpartum diabetes and prediabetes risks among GDM women.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616432","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.757159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.666928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.590205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.264145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.0918536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Weight transfer (dance move)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_transfer_(dance_move)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"GNOME Display Manager","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager"},{"name":"Douglas T2D","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_T2D"}]}
