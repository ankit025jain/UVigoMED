{"id":43195,"title":"Matrix metalloproteinase-9: its interplay with angiogenic factors in inflammatory bowel diseases.","abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 9 is one of the main metalloproteinases reported to be involved in extracellular matrix degradation and recently also in triggering of angiogenic switch in the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The goal of our studies was to estimate in one experimental setting the levels of MMP-9 in sera of Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and to evaluate its possible diagnostic potential in comparison with other biochemical markers and selected proinflammatory and angiogenic factors. The study group included 176 subjects (CD?=?64, UC?=?85, control?=?27). Concentrations of serum MMP-9 were significantly higher in active than inactive forms of IBD, being higher in active UC than in active CD. Both in the case of CD and UC serum MMP-9 positively correlated with disease activity, IL-6 levels, platelet and leukocyte count, midkine, and PDGF-BB, as well as in UC with ESR and in CD with CRP, IL-1, and VEGF-A. Diagnostic accuracy of MMP-9 in distinguishing active UC from active CD was 66%, and displayed higher specificity than CRP (79.0% versus 61.6%, resp.). Evaluation of serum MMP-9 concentrations could aid in differentiation of active UC from active CD. MMP-9 correlated better with inflammatory and angiogenic parameters in CD than in UC.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803722","annotations":[{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.780391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.771483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.743735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.705314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.69807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.603533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.425476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.424417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_(medicine)"}]}
