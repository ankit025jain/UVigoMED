{"id":54072,"title":"[The activity of glutathione antioxidant system at melaksen and valdoxan action under experimental hyperthyroidism in rats].","abstract":"Investigation of glutathione antioxidant system activity and diene conjugates content in rats liver and blood serum at the influence of melaksen and valdoxan under experimental hyperthyroidism (EG) has been revealed. It has been established that the activities of glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GP) and glutathione transferase (GT), growing at pathological conditions, change to the side of control value at these substunces introduction. Reduced glutathione content (GSH) at melaxen and valdoxan action increased compared with values under the pathology, that, obviously, could be associated with a reduction of its spending on the detoxication of free radical oxidation (FRO) toxic products. Diene conjugates level in rats liver and blood serum, increasing at experimental hyperthyroidism conditions, under introduction of melatonin level correcting drugs, also approached to the control meaning. Results of the study indicate on positive effect of melaxen and valdoxan on free radical homeostasis, that appears to be accompanied by decrease of load on the glutathione antioxidant system in comparison with the pathology.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479344","annotations":[{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.915084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.888496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Glutathione S-transferase","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_S-transferase"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glutathione reductase","weight":0.791577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_reductase"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.791459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.646472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.443057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Diene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diene"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Detoxication","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxication"}]}
