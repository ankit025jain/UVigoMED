{"id":69381,"title":"Long-term follow-up after colpocleisis: regret, bowel, and bladder function.","abstract":"Colpocleisis is not a popular option amongst surgeons, possibly due to concern about long-term regret. This study assessed a cohort of women who underwent colpocleisis 2-5 years previously to determine the regret rate, the effect on quality of life (QOL) and bladder and bowel function.This was a longitudinal study of patients who underwent colpocleisis at least 2 years previously. Participants were asked to complete the Prolapse QOL (P-QOL), International Consultation on Incontinence-Urinary Incontinence (ICIQ-UI Short Form) and Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory questionnaires (CRADI). Two additional questions were asked: (1) Do you regret having vaginal closure surgery for prolapse? (never, sometimes, often, all the time), and (2) Would you recommend this surgery to a relative or friend who is not sexually active? (yes, no.)Thirty-four women were identified. Six had died by the time of follow-up, and five declined to answer the questionnaires because of ill health. Twenty-three women responded (67 %). Mean age was 78.68 years. One woman regretted having had the surgery, as the colpocleisis had failed. Twenty-one women (91.3 %) would recommend this surgery; one would not (4.3 %), and another was not sure (4.5 %). Low P-QOL [8 (0-37) ± 9.41), ICIQ-UI (7 (0-17) ± 5.44) and CRADI (10; 0-28 ± 8.13] scores suggest a positive impact on QOL, bladder and bowel function.In this cohort, colpocleisis produced a good outcome with low regret rate (4.3 %), good QOL and minimal effect on bladder and bowel function at 2-5 years.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448725","annotations":[{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.522509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.494868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Consultation (Texas)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultation_(Texas)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Regret (emotion)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(emotion)"},{"name":"Sexual abuse","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse"}]}
