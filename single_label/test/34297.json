{"id":34297,"title":"Scalp fibroma: a rare cutaneous manifestation of tuberous sclerosis.","abstract":"We report a case of a 23-year-old woman with a history of generalised tonic-clonic seizures, reddish brown maculopapular swelling over the face and an enlarging swelling over the scalp. Physical examinations revealed angiofibroma of the face and other typical cutaneous lesions of tuberous sclerosis, for example, shagreen patch and periungual fibroma. Scalp swelling was labelled as fibroma by dermatologists, which was further supported by the histopathological findings. Fibroma of the face is one of the commonest lesions, however, fibroma of the scalp is a rarely described entity.
