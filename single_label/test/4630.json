{"id":4630,"title":"Lung involvement in systemic sclerosis: role of high resolution computed tomography and its relationship with other pulmonary and clinico-serological features.","abstract":"The study investigated the characteristic of interstitial lung disease in a large series of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients by means of HRCT and the correlations between functional lung parameters, serological features and the extent of lung involvement evaluated by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). One hundred and seven SSc patients, consecutively investigated by means of HRCT, standard chest X-ray, and pulmonary function tests, were retrospectively evaluated. Chest radiogram and HRCT scores were strongly associated (Pearson?'s r=0.82, p < .0001); moreover, the first significantly correlated with spirometric parameters, even if weakly. Anti-Scl70 and anti-centromere antibodies were associated with higher (p=0.01) and lower HRCT score (p=0.0002), respectively. The extension of interstitial lung involvement in SSc evaluated with HRCT is directly proportional to functional lung parameters. HRCT, spirometry and DLco should be considered essential in the core-set of non-invasive diagnostic tools for the first-line assessment of scleroderma lung involvement.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25316135","annotations":[{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Scleroderma","weight":0.537411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleroderma"},{"name":"Interstitial lung disease","weight":0.481686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_lung_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.382839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Systemic scleroderma","weight":0.252918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_scleroderma"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Anti-centromere antibodies","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-centromere_antibodies"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Weak interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
