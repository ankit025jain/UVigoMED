{"id":46059,"title":"RNA identity crisis: hepatitis B walks the LINE.","abstract":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration into the host genome has been implicated in the causation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this issue of Cancer Cell, Lau and colleagues report an HBV integration site recurrent in HCC that generates a chimeric transcript with oncogenic function as an RNA (but not protein) through stimulation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling.
