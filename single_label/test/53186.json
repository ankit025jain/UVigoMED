{"id":53186,"title":"Low serum vitamin D is associated with anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody in autoimmune thyroiditis.","abstract":"The association between autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) and vitamin D deficiency is controversial. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and anti-thyroid antibody levels.25(OH)D3, anti-thyroid antibodies, and thyroid function measured in 304 patients who visited the endocrinology clinic were analyzed. The patients were subgrouped into the AITDs or non-AITDs category according to the presence or absence of anti-thyroid antibodies. The relationship between anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and 25(OH)D3 was evaluated.The patients with elevated anti-thyroid antibodies had lower levels of serum 25(OH)D3 than those who did not (12.6±5.5 ng/mL vs. 14.5±7.3 ng/mL, respectively, p<0.001). Importantly, after adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, a negative correlation (r=-0.252, p<0.001) was recognized between 25(OH)D3 and TPOAb levels in the AITDs group, but this correlation did not exist in the non-AITDs group (r=0.117, p=0.127). 25(OH)D3 level was confirmed as an independent factor after adjusting for co-factors that may affect the presence of TPOAb in the AITDs group.25(OH)D3 level is an independent factor affecting the presence of TPOAb in AITDs. The causal effect of 25(OH)D3 deficiency to AITDs is to be elucidated.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532520","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.888107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.809429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.624632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.587921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thyroiditis","weight":0.326815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroiditis"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.279582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.206792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Autoimmune thyroiditis","weight":0.184824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_thyroiditis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.0779046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Thyroid function tests","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_function_tests"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"252","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/252"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
