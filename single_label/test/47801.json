{"id":47801,"title":"Detection of miR-34a and miR-34b/c in stool sample as potential screening biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Explore potential screening biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) by testing methylation of the miR-34a and miR-34b/c promoter in CRC patients' tissue and stool samples. Methylation-specific PCR analyses were performed on sample DNAs: 82 pairs of normal/cancer samples, 82 CRC patients' stool samples, 40 healthy volunteer stool samples, and 20 healthy volunteer blood samples were recruited. miR-34a has been found methylated in 65 of 82 (79.3%) the CRC tissue samples, but only 36 of 82 (43.9%) in corresponding normal samples. And when testing miR-34a in stool, 63 of 82 (76.8 %) CRC stool samples were observed methylated, and 2 of 40 (5%) healthy samples were observed methylated. The methylation for miR-34b/c has been found in 80 of 82 (97.5%) CRC tissue samples, 49 of 82 (59.8%) corresponding CRC normal samples, and 74 of 79 (93.6%) CRC stool samples. Yet we did not detect any methylation from healthy volunteers stool samples or healthy adult blood samples. Results indicated 76.8 % sensitivity and 93.6% specificity of the miR-34a methylation test for detecting CRC using stool samples. Meanwhile, the sensitivity and specificity of miR-34b/c were 95 and 100%, respectively. Moreover, our results revealed that abnormal DNA methylation of miR-34a was correlated with lymph metastasis (P = 0.010). Abnormal methylation of miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes might be regarded as potential biomarkers for noninvasive screening and diagnosis of colorectal cancer.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573638","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.694783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.68333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.665299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.396392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.279334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Stool test","weight":0.114562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stool_test"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"}]}
