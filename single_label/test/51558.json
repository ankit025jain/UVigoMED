{"id":51558,"title":"Cross talk between the extracellular matrix and the immune system in the context of endocrine pancreatic islet transplantation. A review article.","abstract":"This review aims to highlight the importance of the bidirectional influence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune cells in the context of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and endocrine pancreatic islet transplantation. We introduced the main classes of molecules and proteins constituting the ECM as well as cells and cytokines of the immune system with the aim to further examine their roles in T1DM and islet transplantation. Integrins expressed by immune cells and their functions are detailed. Finally, this article reviews the roles of the ECM and the immune system in islet transplantation as well as ECM-related cytokines and their influence on the ECM and immune cells.
