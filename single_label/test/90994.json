{"id":90994,"title":"[Osteoporosis].","abstract":"The quality of the management of patients with osteoporosis varies by country. The recommendations of the Swiss Association against osteoporosis propose intervention thresholds based on the results of the FRAX tool. Despite increasing number of observational studies with several hundred thousands of patients, it is not possible to conclude to a clear increased risk of cardiovascular disease with calcium intakes. A persistent effect of zoledronic acid is observed even after one single injection. There is no increased fracture risk within 7 months following Denosumab treatment cessation.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558909","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.451181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.382223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.305879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.232283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Zoledronic acid","weight":0.183889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoledronic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.150999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Denosumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denosumab"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"}]}
