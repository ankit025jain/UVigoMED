{"id":77530,"title":"Continued spirometry changes after cessation of exposure in asbestos-cement workers.","abstract":"To assess further progression of spirometry parameters among former asbestos-cement plant workers.The following parameters were assessed: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and the ratio (FEV1/FVC) using a linear regression model with mixed effects.The analysis included 3005 individuals. Spirometrically defined restrictive ventilatory defects were registered in 21.6% of the patients, obstructive defects in 8.3%, whereas mixed changes in 7%. Current smokers had significantly lower levels of FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC and a steeper decline compared with nonsmokers. More rapid progression was also observed along with increasing termination of exposure. Having higher exposure was associated with a slower decline in FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratios.This report indicates that asbestos-cement workers with higher cumulative exposure still had lower mean levels of spirometric parameters, despite cessation of asbestos exposure many years ago.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662950","annotations":[{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mixed model","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Asbestos","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"}]}
