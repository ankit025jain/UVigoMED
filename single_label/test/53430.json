{"id":53430,"title":"Dietary zinc supplementation to the donor improves insulin secretion after islet transplantation in chemically induced diabetic rats.","abstract":"Zinc (Zn) is related to insulin synthesis, storage, and secretion. This study demonstrates the effects of Zn supplementation in donor rats on the outcomes of islet transplantation.Donor rats received 3 different regimens of dietary Zn supplementation for 2 weeks before undergoing pancreas donation: a standard diet containing Zn at 50 ppm (control), 1 ppm (low-Zn group) or 1000 ppm (high-Zn group), respectively. Diabetic recipient rats underwent islet transplantation, and the blood glucose levels and insulin secretion were monitored for 7 days after transplantation.The serum and pancreatic Zn levels at the time of donation were significantly lower in the low-Zn group (48.8 ± 25.5 µg/dL and 11.3 ± 1.9 µg/g) and higher in the high-Zn group (147.3 ± 17.6 µg/dL and 18.7 ± 2.2 µg/g) when compared with those observed in the controls (118.7 ± 7.9 µg/dL and 14.6 ± 2.0 µg/g) (P < 0.05). The blood glucose levels became re-elevated 2 days after transplantation in rats receiving islet grafts from the controls and the low-Zn groups. In contrast, in the rats that received islets from the high-Zn groups, these were maintained within a reference range (P < 0.01).These data indicate that a Zn-rich diet for donor rats improves the function of islet grafts in chemically induced diabetic rats.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518501","annotations":[{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.733497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.620859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.553863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Reference ranges for blood tests","weight":0.489861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests"},{"name":"Islet cell transplantation","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.13671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Islet","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
