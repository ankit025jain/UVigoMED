{"id":26059,"title":"[Therapeutic approach and mortality in men and women with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction].","abstract":"The benefit of immediate reperfusion in the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is indisputable. Unfortunately, no reperfusion therapy is applied to nearly 30% of patients without contraindication to such treatment. We aimed to analyze the impact of therapeutic approach on the prognosis after acute phase of STEMI.The study group consisted of 26035 consecutive STEMI patients (8989 females, 34.4%) hopitalized in 456 sites during one year. Data were available from the Polish Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes (PL-ACS) launched in Silesian Center for Heart Diseases, Zabrze.Patiens treated with primary percutaneous intervention (pPCI) had the best outcome. All therapeutic strategies resulted in worse prognosis in women when compared to men. Women had greater 12-month mortality in the conservative, fibrinolytic and interventional treatment group: 33.1% vs 23.2%; p < 0.0001; 24.3% vs 16.2%; p < 0.0001 i 11.4% vs 8.2%, p < 0.0001, respectively. Differences in the surgically treated group were insignificant (men: 25%, women: 8%, p = 0.42).The outcome of conservative, fibrinolytic and interventional treatment was worse in the female group. Primary coronary angioplasty was the most benefical therapeutic strategy.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154208","annotations":[{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.85672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.731623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.687199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.662889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.624215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.610221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.585775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.507676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.473664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.145098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0539337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Zabrze","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabrze"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Ship naming and launching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_naming_and_launching"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"List of astronauts by year of selection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronauts_by_year_of_selection"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
