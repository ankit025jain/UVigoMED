{"id":67182,"title":"Axitinib safety in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: suggestions for daily clinical practice based on case studies.","abstract":"Axitinib , a highly selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors taken orally, is approved for second-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine. We review data for axitinib and discuss strategies to manage or prevent adverse events (AEs) and maximize clinical benefit.A literature search identified key advanced RCC trials of axitinib and other targeted therapies. Each author also contributed a clinical case study to illustrate management approaches in patients who received axitinib following sunitinib in the AXIS Phase III trial. Axitinib has demonstrated a predictable and manageable AE profile in clinical trials; most commonly reported treatment-related events are diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and dysphonia. Case studies demonstrate that successful management requires patient awareness of potential AEs, regular monitoring and dose modification for specific AEs.Improvement in progression-free survival with axitinib versus sorafenib in a Phase III trial supports preferred selection of axitinib in the second-line setting. The safety profile of axitinib versus mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and sorafenib also provides the opportunity to personalize treatment in advanced RCC based on the likelihood for specific AEs to occur and on prior toxicities in the first-line setting.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641566","annotations":[{"name":"Axitinib","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axitinib"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.802814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.789093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.490105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
