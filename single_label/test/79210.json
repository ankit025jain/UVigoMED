{"id":79210,"title":"Efficacy and safety of grass sublingual immunotherapy tablet, MK-7243: a large randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"In North America, few studies have evaluated sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis (AR/C); pediatric data are sparse. The authors report findings from the largest published immunotherapy trial yet conducted in adults and children.To evaluate grass sublingual immunotherapy tablet (MK-7243) treatment in subjects with AR/C.North American subjects (5-65 years old) with grass allergy were randomized 1:1 to once-daily MK-7243 (2,800 BAU Phleum pratense) or placebo. The first dose was given at the investigator's office; subsequent doses were self-administered at home. The primary end point was total combined score (TCS; rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom score [DSS] plus daily medication score [DMS]) over the entire grass pollen season (GPS). Key secondary end points included entire-season DSS, DMS, peak-season TCS, and rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaire scores. Safety outcomes included adverse events (AEs).One thousand five hundred one subjects were randomized (85% polysensitized, 25% had asthma). MK-7243 yielded improvements vs placebo of 23% in entire-season TCS (median difference -0.98, P < .001), 29% in peak-season TCS (median difference -1.33, P < .001), 20% in entire-season DSS (median difference -0.64, P = .001), 35% in entire-season DMS (mean difference -0.48, P < .001), and 12% in peak-season rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaire (median difference -0.13, P = .027). Efficacy between children and adults was similar. Most AEs were transient local application-site reactions, with no serious treatment-related AEs or anaphylactic shock. Three subjects (1 placebo, 2 MK-7243) had moderate systemic allergic reactions.MK-7243 was effective in polysensitized grass-allergic North American children and adults with AR/C in this large trial, confirming previous research.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468255","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.907611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Anaphylactic shock","weight":0.827188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylactic_shock"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Pollen","weight":0.803683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.716729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.523382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.418291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.414255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Timothy-grass","weight":0.38911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy-grass"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.378894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.30477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.178651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.104145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Global Positioning System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Grass","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
