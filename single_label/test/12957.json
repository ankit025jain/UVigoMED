{"id":12957,"title":"[Effect of schemes second line quadruple therapy on interactions of some protective factors in gastric mucosal tissue in experimental ulcer].","abstract":"THE AIM OF INVESTIGATION: To study the effect of schemes second line quadruple therapy on the state of gastric mucosal barrier and NO formation in experimental ulcer.The study included 60 white male rats weighing 150-190 gr, mixed population. The effect of the standard second-line regimens on the content of the fractions of insoluble glycoproteins, on indicators of NO formation and anaerobic glycolysis in gastric mucosal tissue in experimental ulcer.Quadruple therapy consisting of omeprazole, de-nol, amoxicillin and tetracycline stimulates mechanisms of protective barrier, which has a positive effect on the mechanisms of NO formation. Scheme with omeprazole, de-nol, tetracycline and metronidazole inhibits the synthesis of mucosal barrier, the key mechanisms of NO formation.In the plan of correction of mechanisms of cytoprotection in the gastric mucosal tissue quadruple therapy with omeprazole, de ethanol, amoxicillin, and tetracycline is considered to be effective.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501949","annotations":[{"name":"Metronidazole","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"},{"name":"Tetracycline","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Omeprazole","weight":0.690507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.626629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.582178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.507755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.203104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Cytoprotection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoprotection"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Scheme (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Second line (parades)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_line_(parades)"},{"name":"Quadruple","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"The Quadruple","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quadruple"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Scheme (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics)"}]}
