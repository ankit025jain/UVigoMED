{"id":56410,"title":"Consecutive case series with long-term follow-up of full macular translocation for myopic choroidal neovascularisation.","abstract":"To examine the long-term outcomes of full macular translocation (FMT) for myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV).We evaluated a consecutive case series of 60 eyes with mCNV that underwent FMT. We assessed the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus photographs and ?uorescein angiography images, and evaluated the anatomic and visual outcomes.The mean follow-up period was 76.3?months. The macula was relocated successfully in all eyes. The mean distance of macular translocation was 2842??m. The baseline BCVA was 0.78 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) unit; the logMAR BCVA values at 1, 3 and 5?years postoperatively significantly (p<0.001) improved to 0.54 at 1?year and then remained stable. The new fovea was associated with enlargement of the myopic chorioretinal atrophy in 19 (31.7%) eyes. Subfoveal or juxtafoveal CNV at the translocated new fovea developed in five (8.3%) eyes.FMT for mCNV maintained the improvement in VA for more than 5?years. However, postoperative complications and progression of chorioretinal atrophy due to myopia still seem to limit the visual improvement after FMT for mCNV.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692747","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.522519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.395022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.173267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.15119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.0994624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0804046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Semi-major axis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis"},{"name":"Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christelijk_Nationaal_Vakverbond"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
