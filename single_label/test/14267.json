{"id":14267,"title":"Seeing is believing: dynamic changes in renal epithelial autophagy during injury and repair.","abstract":"Ischemic injury to the kidneys is a prevalent clinical problem, contributing importantly to chronic kidney disease. Yet, underlying molecular mechanisms are elusive. To address the possible role of autophagy, we engineered a novel strain of mice harboring a ubiquitously expressed CAG-RFP-EGFP-LC3 transgene. Using this tool, we examined the post-ischemic kidney and detailed the dynamics of renal tubular epithelial autophagy. In addition, we defined the role of MTOR in the resolution of autophagy during epithelial survival and kidney repair.
