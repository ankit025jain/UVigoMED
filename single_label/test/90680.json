{"id":90680,"title":"Two-step technique for posterior optic buttonholing of intraocular lens.","abstract":"This study aims to describe a two-step surgical technique for placement of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) in cases with crystalline lens subluxation resulting from non-progressive zonular dialysis.The first stage entails a phacoemulsification with creation of a 4-mm posterior capsular opening using an automated vitrector. The second stage performed 6 weeks later includes an anterior vitrectomy and injection of a foldable three-piece IOL in the sulcus. The haptics of IOL are positioned in the sulcus while the optic is pushed behind the posterior capsular opening therefore \"buttonholing\" the IOL.Seven eyes of seven patients with posttraumatic zonular dialysis were operated using this technique. Follow-up of all cases revealed a well-centered IOL with good postoperative visual acuity (20/20 to 20/80).Our two-stage surgical technique precludes the insertion of capsular tension ring in cases with non-progressive zonular dialysis. The technique is recommended in the presence of less than or equal to 6 clock hours of zonular dialysis with preexisting posterior capsular tear or herniation of vitreous in the anterior chamber.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584307","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Posterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.789505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.786427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Ectopia lentis","weight":0.751267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopia_lentis"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.526193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.524595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Zonule of Zinn","weight":0.509766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonule_of_Zinn"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.407225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Haptic technology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"2080s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2080s"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Multistage rocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket"},{"name":"Sulcus (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Folding wing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_wing"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"}]}
