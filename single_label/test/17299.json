{"id":17299,"title":"Pneumococcal serotypes and serogroups causing invasive disease in Pakistan, 2005-2013.","abstract":"While pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been implemented in most countries worldwide, use in Asia has lagged in part because of a lack of data on the amount of disease that is vaccine preventable in the region. We describe pneumococcal serotypes elicited from 111 episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) from 2005 to 2013 among children and adults in Pakistan. Seventy-three percent (n = 81) of 111 IPD episodes were cases of meningitis (n = 76 in children 0-15 years and n = 5 among adults). Serotypes were determined by target amplification of DNA extracted from pneumococcal isolates (n = 52) or CSF specimens (n = 59). Serogroup 18 was the most common serogroup causing meningitis in children <5 years, accounting for 21% of cases (n = 13). The 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 10) or PCV10- related serotypes were found in 61% (n = 47) of childhood (age 0-15 years) meningitis episodes. PCV-13 increased this coverage to 63% (one additional serotype 19A; n = 48). Our data indicate that use of PCVs would prevent a large proportion of serious pneumococcal disease.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892937","annotations":[{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.810842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.711178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.685857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.663904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.361053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.271124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.199541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"British Columbia Highway 19A","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_19A"},{"name":"DNA extraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
