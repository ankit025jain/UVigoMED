{"id":44739,"title":"Overexpression of her-2 associated with the progression of esophageal cancer patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to test the expression level of her-2 in the tissue of esophageal cancer, and the relationship with the clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients with esophageal cancer, and the influence to the prognosis.We assessed her-2 in esophageal cancer tissues obtained from 72 patients' immunohistochemistry. The data were analyzed by SPSS software with chi2 test, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Log-Rank test and Cox regression analysis. Data was expressed as mean +/- SD. A two-tailed p value of 0.05 was considered significant.Twenty (27.8%) were found to have her-2 overexpression in esophageal cancer tissues, while normal esophageal tissues were negative. The expression of her-2 protein in esophageal cancer tissues is higher than those in adjacent normal esophageal tissues. The expression of her-2 is closely related to differentiation degree, infiltration depth, lymph nodes' metastasis and pTNM stage of the esophageal cancer. The 5-year survival rate of patients with her-2 overexpression is significantly lower than the patients with non-overexpression (5.0% vs. 36.5%, log-rank test, chi2 = 31.936, p = 0.000). Besides the influence of differentiation degree, infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis and pTNM stage to the prognosis, the level of her-2 expression is also an independent prognostic factor in esophageal cancer patients.Her-2 might become a potential molecular marker of diagnosis and new targets of clinical treatment of esophageal cancer.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719937","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.928136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.550591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.530091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.451369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.407873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.272559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.221893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Molecular marker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_marker"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
