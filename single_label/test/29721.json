{"id":29721,"title":"Stigmatizing harm reduction through language: a case study into the use of \"addict\" and opposition to supervised injection sites in Canada.","abstract":"Stigma continues to be the largest barrier for accessing treatment among people experiencing drug addiction. The dominant portrayals that exist about people who use drugs are often damaging and act to dehumanize the group as a whole. When left unchallenged, stereotypes can act as truthful depictions and facilitate the resistance against harm reduction services that are based on a human rights model. The use of labels is one way stigma is perpetuated by eliciting the label's stereotyped narratives onto an individual or group. Within harm reduction discourse, the word \"addict\" can have detrimental effects on how the public perceives people experiencing addiction and their deservingness of pragmatic services. This article aims to draw attention to the inattention we give \"addict\" in language and explain how its routine use in society acts to perpetuate addiction stigma. Using the example of supervised injection site opposition in Canada, the use of \"addict\" is used as a way to understand how stigma through language works to impede the expansion of harm reduction initiatives.
