{"id":85653,"title":"Urine real-time polymerase chain reaction detection for children virus pneumonia with acute human cytomegalovirus infection.","abstract":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen of viral pneumonia in children. The diagnosis of acute HCMV infection is complicated and difficult.Clinical and laboratory data of 6063 hospitalized children with respiratory infection and 509 with respiratory virus infection alone were retrospectively analyzed. Urine and respiratory specimens of 186 hospitalized children with pneumonia were also prospectively collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a chemiluminescent assay were used to detect HCMV DNA copy number, the pp65 gene, and HCMV IgM.The patients with respiratory virus infection alone and those with pulmonary HCMV infection (n?=?422) were mostly children aged <6 months old (82.91%, 422/509). The accuracy of urine HCMV DNA (82.32%) was higher than that of HCMV IgM (67.78%), indicating that PCR of urine samples is suitable for determining pediatric acute pulmonary HCMV infection. There was no significant difference in detecting HCMV DNA or the pp65 gene between urinary and respiratory specimens (P?>?0.05) in 186 pediatric pneumonia cases. The accuracy of the pp65 gene measured in urine for determining acute pulmonary HCMV infection was the highest (93.01%).Our study shows a novel method for investigating acute pulmonary HCMV infection in children by using real-time PCR and non-invasive samples. This study also highlights the superiority and potential use of the pp65 gene as an important target for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary HCMV infection.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884393","annotations":[{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.685154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.636988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.377115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Viral pneumonia","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pneumonia"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.279334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"HCMV (human cytomegalovirus)","weight":0.128041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCMV_(human_cytomegalovirus)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chemiluminescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
