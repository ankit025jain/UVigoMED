{"id":2776,"title":"Reconstruction of the limbal vasculature after limbal-conjunctival autograft transplantation in pterygium surgery: an angiography study.","abstract":"We evaluated the angiographic features of the affected limbus in patients with pterygia and assessed limbal reconstruction outcomes after limbal-conjunctival autograft (LCA) transplantation in terms of vascular remodeling.We studied prospectively 31 eyes of 31 patients who underwent pterygium excision and LCA transplantation; 28 eyes of 28 normal participants served as controls. Anterior segment indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) was performed for each participant preoperatively and at 1 week, and 1 and 3 months postoperatively. The perioperative angiographic features of the pterygium were compared to those in normal eyes. The structural changes of the marginal corneal vascular arcades (MCAs) and LCA were quantitatively assessed postoperatively in terms of vascular density and lacunarity.Deteriorated MCAs that extended beyond the pterygium head were observed in the pterygium group. The pterygium had a dual blood supply from the conjunctival and episcleral circulations. In terms of limbal reconstruction, the engorged reperfusion vessels arose from the adjacent episcleral vessels along the limbus at 1 week postoperatively. The reconstructed MCAs had begun to appear at 1 month postoperatively and became apparent 3 months postoperatively in 26 (83.9%) of 31 eyes of the pterygium group, resulting in a successful clinical outcome. Higher vascular density and lower lacunarity were measured in the limbus and the graft at 3 months than at 1 month (P < 0.001 for all), which indicated fine reorganization of the reconstructed vessels.The pterygium had a dual blood supply, and the remodeling of the affected limbus and LCA continued up to 3 months postoperatively.","date":"2014-12-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25406286","annotations":[{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.66223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.559079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.508716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Indocyanine green","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indocyanine_green"},{"name":"Pterygium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygium"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"Newspaper circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_circulation"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Corneal limbus","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_limbus"},{"name":"Arcade (architecture)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_(architecture)"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Most recent common ancestor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor"},{"name":"Engorgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engorgement"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
