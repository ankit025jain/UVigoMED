{"id":77916,"title":"[Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) - basics and therapeutic approaches in otorhinolaryngology].","abstract":"Adipose-derived Stromal Cells (ASC) - Basics and Therapeutic Approaches in Otorhinolaryngology Mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue can be easily harvested with less discomfort, low donor-site morbidity and high amount compared to bone marrow-derived stem cells. Due to their multilineage differentiation potential in various cell types, immunmodulatory properties and their capability to enhance wound healing, ASC are a promising cell source for tissue engineering approaches and regenerative medicine. They are characterized by the expression of specific surface marker proteins and their differentiation potential into the mesenchymal lineages. Whereas only preclinical studies are published for otorhinolaryngology-related therapeutic options using ASC, various diseases, for instance graft-versus-host disease, have already been treated with ASC in single cases or clinical trials. Safety and genomic stability of ASC as well as the risk of spontaneous malignant transformation are still disputed. This review summarizes the current literature on characterization and anatomic localization of ASC. In addition, beside the presentation of preclinical studies concerning therapeutic approaches in otorhinolaryngology as well as of current clinical applications, the issue of safety of ASC in human stem cell therapy is discussed.
