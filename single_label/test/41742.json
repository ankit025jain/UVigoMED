{"id":41742,"title":"Interleukin-10 gene promoter polymorphism and susceptibility to liver cirrhosis.","abstract":"Liver cirrhosis is the end-stage of various liver diseases, which has a poor prognosis and determined by deterioration of hepatic functional capacity and consecutive development of hepatic complications. We investigated the role of IL-10-592 A/C, IL-10-819 C/T and IL-10-1082 A/G gene polymorphisms on the development of liver cirrhosis.A 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted, including 266 patients from 302 Military Hospital. Genotyping of IL-10-592 A/C, IL-10-819 C/T and IL-10-1082 A/G were performed in a 384-well plate format on the Sequenom MassARRAY platform.Multivariate regression analyses showed that subjects carrying the IL-10-592 CC variant had a significant increased risk of liver cirrhosis (OR: 1.83, 95% Cl: 1.10-3.03), and IL-0-592 A/C showed a significant increased risk in recessive model (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.15-3.45). We found those carrying IL-10-592 CC genotype had a heavy increased risk of liver cirrhosis in those with positive chronic hepatitis B, with an OR (95% CI) of 2.46 (1.35-4.42), and a significant interaction was observed between the IL-10-592 A/C genotype and chronic hepatitis B infection (P = 0.036). Those carrying IL-10-819 C/T and IL-10-1082 A/G variants had non-significant increased risk of liver cirrhosis.Our study demonstrates that IL-10-592A/C gene polymorphism would enhance the risk for liver cirrhosis, and this gene variant has interaction with chronic hepatitis B infection in Asian population.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901158","annotations":[{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.786427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.689153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.663867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.630211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.347521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.174709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.142609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Liver diseases","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_diseases"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
