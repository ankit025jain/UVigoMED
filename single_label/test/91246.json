{"id":91246,"title":"Lower limb trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder: a single UK trauma unit's experience.","abstract":"The incidence and factors influencing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in victims of severe lower extremity injuries are largely unknown. We studied a cohort of patients treated in a specialist centre to try and elucidate these unknowns.The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCL-S) was used as a reliable and reproducible patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) assessing all patients for PTSD. Sixty patients were included in the study. This was a prospective analysis of the progression of the PCL-S scores. The data were analysed using a non-parametric Wilcoxon test.Sixty patients were recruited into the study cohort. We found that the incidence in this cohort of PTSD was 30%. We found that age had an influence on outcome. Those who were 50 years old or over had a significantly lower incidence of PTSD according to the PCL-S scores and appeared to recover from it significantly more effectively.Up to a third of patients suffering from a severe lower extremity injury will develop PTSD. Patients of the younger age group are more severely affected and will need psychological support to overcome their distress.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525269","annotations":[{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.807234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.585964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.549967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.342541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.044683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Programmable read-only memory","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_read-only_memory"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Try","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Try"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Psychiatric rehabilitation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Civil disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"}]}
