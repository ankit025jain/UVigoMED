{"id":62136,"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of a defined immunophenotypic and molecular genetic approach for peripheral T/NK-cell lymphomas. A North American PTCL study group project.","abstract":"The diagnosis of peripheral T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas (PTNKCL) is difficult with few standards for required ancillary studies. We evaluated a series of PTNKCLs using a tiered approach to immunohistochemistry and molecular genetic characterization to document diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. Seven hematopathologists reviewed 374 cases that included PTNKCL and non-PTNKCL cases to mimic diagnostic practice. Cases received tier 0, 1, and 2 diagnoses by 3 independent pathologists, on the basis of hematoxylin and eosin stains and progressive immunohistochemistry panels. A tier 2b diagnosis was rendered when gene rearrangement data were available, and a final consensus diagnosis was rendered after discussion of each case. Across all 374 cases, consensus agreement was 92.5%. For PTNKCLs, World Health Organization subclassification was possible in 16.5%, 37.1%, 82.8%, and 85.9% of individual reviewer diagnoses at tier 0, 1, 2, and 2b, respectively. Gene rearrangement contributed to a change in diagnosis in 51 of 647 (8%) individual reviews. Following this algorithm may provide prognostic information on the basis of individual marker expression in common PTNKCL types (CD4 in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified and PD-1 in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma). This evidence-based approach to the diagnosis of PTNKCL informs practicing pathologists, clinical trial designers, and policy-makers regarding required ancillary studies.
