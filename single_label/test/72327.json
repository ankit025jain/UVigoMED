{"id":72327,"title":"TYRO3 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.","abstract":"We evaluated the potential of TYRO3 as a therapeutic target in various types of breast cancer cell lines.The effects of TYRO3-knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) on proliferation, cell-cycle distribution, and cell signaling in four estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-non-amplified (luminal-type), two ER-negative/HER2-amplified (HER2-type), and two ER-negative/HER2-non-amplified (triple negative [TN]-type) cell lines were compared.Whereas TYRO3 knockdown induced the greatest proliferation suppression in luminal-type cells, and to a lesser extent in HER2-type cells, no proliferation inhibition was observed in TN-type cells. The TYRO3 siRNA-induced proliferation inhibition in luminal-type cells was observed in both estradiol (E2)-rich and -null conditions. The proliferation suppression was correlated with G0-G1/S cell-cycle arrest. Western blot analysis showed a decrease in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or STAT3, and in cyclin D1 only in cell lines sensitive to TYRO3-knockdown.TYRO3 is a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer, particularly in luminal-type cells.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982338","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.911436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.697229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.543104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.51315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.370858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Triple-negative breast cancer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-negative_breast_cancer"}]}
