{"id":81802,"title":"Longitudinal relationship between plasma reactive oxygen metabolites and periodontal condition in the maintenance phase of periodontal treatment.","abstract":"The present cohort study describes the longitudinal relationship between plasma oxidative status and periodontitis progression during the maintenance phase of treatment.Forty-five patients (mean age 58.8 years) were monitored from 2008 to 2013. Periodontal conditions, including probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL), were recorded. Measurements of plasma reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) and biologic antioxidant potential (BAP) were performed to evaluate plasma oxidative status. The patients were assigned into 2 groups as low and high plasma ROM level using a cut-off value which was median of plasma ROM level at baseline.In the subjects with low plasma ROM level at baseline, changes in mean CAL were positively correlated with changes in plasma ROM levels, bleeding on probing, and plaque control record, but not with PPD. In the subjects with high plasma ROM at baseline, changes in CAL were significantly associated with only PPD at baseline. On the other hands there were no significant associations between changes in CAL and those in plasma BAP levels.When plasma ROM level in periodontitis patients was low, increases in plasma ROM level were associated with those in CAL during the maintenance phase of treatment.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825927","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.760388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.52625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.477511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.312522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Bap (German band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bap_(German_band)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Read-only memory","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"}]}
