{"id":63705,"title":"Long-term immune reconstitution and infection burden after mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"Mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) or umbilical cord blood (UCB) can be chosen as alternative donors for allogeneic stem cell transplantation but might be associated with long-lasting immune deficiency. Sixty-six patients who underwent a first transplantation from either UCB (n = 30) or 9/10 MMUD (n = 36) and who survived beyond 3 months were evaluated. Immune reconstitution was prospectively assessed at sequential time points after transplantation. NK, B, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells and their naïve and memory subsets, as well as regulatory T cells (Treg), were studied. Detailed analyses on infections occurring after 3 months were also assessed. The 18-month cumulative incidences of infection-related death were 8% and 3%, and of infections were 72% and 57% after MMUD and UCB transplantation, respectively. Rates of infection per 12 patient-month were roughly 2 overall (1 for bacterial, .9 for viral, and .3 for fungal infections). Memory, naïve CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells, naïve B cells, and Treg cells reconstitution between the 2 sources were roughly similar. Absolute CD4(+)T cells hardly reached 500 per ?L by 1 year after transplantation and most B cells were of naïve phenotype. Correlations between immune reconstitution and infection were then performed by multivariate analyses. Low CD4(+) and high CD8(+)T cells absolute counts at 3 months were linked to increased risks of overall and viral (but not bacterial) infections. When assessing for the naïve/memory phenotypes at 3 months among the CD4(+) T cell compartment, higher percentages of memory subsets were protective against late infections. Central memory CD4(+)T cells protected against overall and bacterial infections; late effector memory CD4(+)T cells protected against overall, bacterial, and viral infections. To the contrary, high percentage of effector- and late effector-memory subsets at 3 months among the CD8(+) T cell compartment predicted higher risks for viral infections. Patients who underwent transplantation from alternative donors represent a population with very high risk of infection. Detailed phenotypic analysis of immune reconstitution may help to evaluate infection risk and to adjust infection prophylaxis.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
