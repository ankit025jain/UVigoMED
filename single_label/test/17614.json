{"id":17614,"title":"Molecular identification of the agent of Q fever - Coxiella burnetii - in domestic animals in State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","abstract":"Over the last recent years, the number of Q fever cases have has increased throughout the world. An epidemiological investigation was performed in the area in which the first molecular documentation of Q fever in Brazil was previously reported.Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and PCR of Coxiella burnetii targeting the htpAB gene were performed in samples from 14 dogs (blood); 1 cat (blood); 10 goats (blood, milk, vaginal swab and anal swab); 3 sheep (blood); and 2 horses (blood).Two dogs, two sheep and five goats were seroreactive. DNA was amplified from 6 milk and 2 blood samples from goats and from dogs, respectively. The sequence of the amplicons exhibited 99% sequence similarity with the homologous sequence of the htpAB gene of C. burnetii RSA 331 (GenBank - CP000890).The results confirm C. burnetii infection in animals in Rio de Janeiro and reinforce the need for the surveillance of Q fever in Brazil.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861300","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.851375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Q fever","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_fever"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"List of domesticated animals","weight":0.614156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_domesticated_animals"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Coxiella burnetii","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxiella_burnetii"},{"name":"Rio de Janeiro","weight":0.490777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.394674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.375442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.353557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.267264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.199415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Pap test","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pap_test"},{"name":"Rio de Janeiro (state)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"}]}
