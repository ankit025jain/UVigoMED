{"id":43586,"title":"Detection of vascular endothelial growth factor in colon cancer xenografts using bevacizumab based near infrared fluorophore conjugate.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to develop the near infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-based imaging agent for the visualization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in colon cancer. AlexaFluor 750 conjugating with bevacizumab, and injected intravenously into nude mice bearing VEGF over-expressing HT29 human colorectal cancer. Optical imaging was performed at 15 min, 24 h and 48 h post injection. Immunofluorescences staining of the tumor sections were performed. HT29 colorectal cancer xenografts were clearly visualized with bevacizumab-AlexaFluor 750.Ex vivo analysis showed 2.1?±?0.4%, 37.6?±?6.3% and 38.5?±?6.2% injected dose/g accumulated in the tumors at 15 min, 24 h and 48 h respectively. Tumor uptake was significantly decreased in pretreated with excess of bevacizumab (p = 0.002). Immunofluorescence analysis showed strong staining of anti-CD 31 antibody around the blood vessels. Anti-VEGF-A and bevacizumab showed heterogeneous expression throughout the tumor.Current study successfully detected the VEGF expression in HT29 colorectal cancer xenografts, signifying as a potential agent for non-invasive imaging of VEGF expression, which may be applied in clinical practice.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780003","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.795292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.750287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.699676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.622707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.542333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.452782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.245436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Optical imaging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_imaging"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
