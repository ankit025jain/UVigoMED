{"id":74142,"title":"Nutlin-3 induces BCL2A1 expression by activating ELK1 through the mitochondrial p53-ROS-ERK1/2 pathway.","abstract":"Nutlin-3 which occupies the p53 binding pocket in HDM2, has been reported to activate apoptosis through both the transcriptional activity-dependent and -independent programs of p53. Transcription-independent apoptosis by nutlin-3 is triggered by p53 which is translocated to mitochondria. However, we previously demonstrated that the nutlin-3-induced mitochondrial translocation of p53 stimulates ERK1/2 activation, an anti-apoptosis signal, via mitochondrial ROS generation. We report on how nutlin-3-stimulated ERK1/2 activity inhibits p53-induced apoptosis. Among the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins, BCL2A1 expression was increased by nutlin-3 at both the mRNA and protein levels, and this increase was prevented by the inhibition of ERK1/2. TEMPO, a ROS scavenger, and PFT-? , a blocker of the mitochondrial translocation of p53, also inhibited BCL2A1 expression as well as ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, nutlin-3 stimulated phosphorylation of ELK1, which was prevented by all compounds that inhibited nutlin-3-induced ERK1/2 such as U0126, PFT-? and TEMPO. Moreover, an increase in BCL2A1 expression was weakened by the knockdown of ELK1. Finally, nutlin-3-induced apoptosis was found to be potentiated by the knockdown of BCL2A1, as demonstrated by an increase of in hypo-diploidic cells and Annexin V-positive cells. Parallel to the increase in apoptotic cells, the knockdown of BCL2A1 augmented the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. It is noteworthy that the augmented levels of apoptosis induced by the knockdown of BCL2A1 were comparable to those of apoptosis induced by U0126. Collectively, these results suggest that nutlin-3-activated ERK1/2 may stimulate the transcription of BCL2A1 via the activation of ELK1, and BCL2A1 expression may contribute to the inhibitory effect of ERK1/2 on nutlin-3-induced apoptosis, thereby constituting a negative feedback loop of p53-induced apoptosis.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867259","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.879203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.789504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Negative feedback","weight":0.717586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.698675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.674244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.480135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.445291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"BCL2-related protein A1","weight":0.261135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCL2-related_protein_A1"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.204334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"},{"name":"ELK1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELK1"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Turn (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
