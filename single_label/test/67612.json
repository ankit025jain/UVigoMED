{"id":67612,"title":"TNF-? inhibitors do not impair sperm quality in males with ankylosing spondylitis after short-term or long-term treatment.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to study the influence of active disease status and TNF-? antagonists on sperm quality in a group of AS patients.Twenty-three active AS patients and 42 controls were recruited. Patients' sperm samples were analysed at baseline (previous to) and at 3-6 months after TNF-? therapy (adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept) administration. Baseline assessment was made for only 20 patients, 2 of them proving to have normal fertility, 2 having a pregnant stable partner and the third having a 9-month-old child. Six patients were retested after 12 months of biologic therapy. Each patient acted as his own comparator. Results were further compared with sperm samples from age-matched controls. Sperm analysis was performed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 guidelines.Patients' baseline assessment showed normozoospermia in 91% and oligozoospermia in 9% of patients. No significant differences in sperm quality were noticed at follow-up visits compared with baseline. Comparison to controls showed no statistically significant differences in semen quality, with some exceptions: the control group presented a higher percentage of non-progressive and immobile sperm cells and higher numbers of head and tail atypias.Sperm quality in patients with active AS and after receiving short- and long-term TNF-? blocker therapy is comparable to sperm quality in healthy controls. Our study confirms that the disease process of AS does not have a major impact on sperm quality and that treatment with anti-TNF has no negative impact on sperm quality even under long-term treatment.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599921","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Infliximab","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab"},{"name":"Etanercept","weight":0.849748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etanercept"},{"name":"Ankylosing spondylitis","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adalimumab","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.630503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.611707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.596924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.541117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Oligospermia","weight":0.341689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligospermia"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.253023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.208523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.189263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Semen quality","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_quality"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Spondylitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylitis"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
