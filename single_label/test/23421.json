{"id":23421,"title":"Thoracic empyema in children: clinical presentation, microbiology analysis and therapeutic options.","abstract":"Thoracic empyema is an accumulation of purulent fluid in the pleural space presenting as a complication of bacterial pneumonia. The aims of the study were to present the incidence, demographic results, clinical presentation, laboratory and microbiology results, imaging and the therapeutic options. From January 1992 until December 2009 we collected data of children hospitalized with empyema in our medical center in north of Israel. Empyema was found in 53 pediatric patients. The median age of the patients was 3 years and 31 (58%) were male. Forty one (77%) of the cases were diagnosed in the last nine years. Fever, cough and respiratory distress were the most frequent clinical signs. In 29 (55%) patients pleural effusion was found at admission. Chest ultrasound was performed in 44 (83%) of the patients. Causative organisms were confirmed by culture in 35 patients. Positive culture was found in 17 (32%) patients in the pleural fluid. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading pathogen. The drugs the patients received at admission were penicillin in 21 cases, cefuroxime in19 cases and ceftriaxone in 11 cases. During hospitalization a change of antibiotic therapy was required, using mainly ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The pleural purulent fluid was drained by video assisted thoracoscopy surgery in 34 (64%) patients. All the children recovered. The incidence of empyema as a complication of community acquired pneumonia had increased in the last decade in our region. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen. Third generation cephalosprins and clindamycin can be suggested as a good empiric treatment.
