{"id":51084,"title":"[Radioiodine in the treatment of generalized papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma].","abstract":"Iodine has a physiological function as part of thyroxine, its utilization being small elsewhere in the body. In fact, radioiodine can be termed as targeted therapy of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma. It is an effective means of destroying the healthy thyroid tissue remaining after thyroidectomy and thus sensitizing the monitoring with serum thyreoglobulin. Radioiodine has maintained its status especially in the treatment of locally spread and metastasized thyroid carcinoma. Treatment is individualized owing to the varying ability of metastases to pick up radioiodine.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724456","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.718951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.520556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.432236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.115353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"}]}
