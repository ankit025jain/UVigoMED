{"id":38311,"title":"Two novel mutations in glucocerebrosidase, C23W and IVS7-1 G>A, identified in Type 1 Gaucher patients heterozygous for N370S.","abstract":"Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder resulting from deficient glucocerebrosidase activity. There have been nearly 300 mutations described to date. Novel mutations can potentially provide insight into the biochemical basis of the disease. Two novel mutations are described in two Type 1 Gaucher patients with N370S compound heterozygosity; a point mutation that causes an amino acid substitution at cysteine residue 23 for tryptophan, and a second point mutation within the splicing element at the 3' end of intron 7. Both mutations were identified by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of patient glucocerebrosidase genomic DNA. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was established for both novel mutations for efficient identification in future patients. Past literature suggests that mutations affecting cysteine residues involved in disulfide bridges, as well as mutations affecting splicing patterns of the glucocerebrosidase transcript, are detrimental to enzyme activity. However, compound heterozygosity with N370S, a mild mutation, will lead to a mild phenotype. The cases reported here support these past findings.
