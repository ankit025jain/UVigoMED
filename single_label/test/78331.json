{"id":78331,"title":"The treatment outcome of radical radiotherapy in laryngeal cancer.","abstract":"This study reports the treatment outcome of radiotherapy alone for laryngeal cancerA retrospective analysis was performed on 138 patients with stage I to IV squamous cell carcinoma of larynx who received radiotherapy alone in Division of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand between 2003 and 2009.The 4-year local control (LC) rate in all patients was 44.1%. The 4-year overall survival (OS) was 82.1%. The 4-year LC rates for stage I, II, III, and IV were 75.3%, 69.4%, 57.1%, and 36.9%,respectively (p = 0.0055). Finally, the 4-year OS rates for stage I, II, III, and IV were 85%, 78.6%, 91.1%, and 71.5%, respectively. The laryngeal preservation rate of all stages was 73%.In conclusion, the treatment outcome of radiotherapy alone in all stages of laryngeal cancer in our center was unsatisfactory when compared to other series.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701736","annotations":[{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.719913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.529175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.444833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.35753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.265097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.200444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.147199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chiang Mai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai"},{"name":"Chiang Mai University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai_University"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"44,100 Hz","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz"},{"name":"Monarch","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
