{"id":66832,"title":"[Salvage radical prostatectomy for brachytherapy failure: preliminary results].","abstract":"Analysis of preliminary results in six patients operated by second-line (salvage) radical prostatectomy for local recurrence after low-dose brachytherapy.Since January 2009, six patients had an open salvage radical prostatectomy with a lymph node dissection and without neurovascular bundles preservation for a low-dose I125 brachytherapy failure. Local recurrence was confirmed by trans-rectal biopsy or TURP. All the patients had PSA increase or lower urinary tract symptoms. Bone scan and pelvis MRI were performed to detect a locally advanced disease, a lymph node involvement or the presence of bone metastasis. Pathology reports and PSA level at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were analyzed.Salvage radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection was performed in all patients without major complications. The PSA level was below 0.1 ng/mL in five out of six patients at 1 and 3 months. The only case of persistent PSA is treated by androgen deprivation in a pT3b N1 patient.Salvage radical prostatectomy after brachytherapy failure was feasible with a limited perioperative morbidity. This second-line curative treatment in a selected group of patients should be kept in mind. Our early results looked promising.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674330","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Bone scintigraphy","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_scintigraphy"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.794664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.655169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.356946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.347994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.336396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.327831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.308983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.206031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Sleep deprivation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"}]}
