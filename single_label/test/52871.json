{"id":52871,"title":"Prospective evaluation of (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT in differentiated thyroid cancer patients with raised thyroglobulin and negative (131)I-whole body scan: comparison with (18)F-FDG PET-CT.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with negative (131)I-whole body scan (WBS) along with serially increasing serum thyroglobulin (Tg), and compare the same with (18)F-FDG PET-CT.Sixty two DTC patients with serially rising Tg levels and negative (131)I-WBS were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT and (18)F-FDG PET-CT within an interval of two weeks. PET-CT analysis was done on a per-patient basis, location wise and lesion wise. All PET-CT lesions were divided into four categories-local, nodal, pulmonary and skeletal. Histopathology and/or serial serum Tg level, clinical and imaging follow up (minimum-1 year) were used as a reference standard.Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT demonstrated disease in 40/62 (65 %) patients and (18)F-FDG PET-CT in 45/62 (72 %) patients, with no significant difference on McNemar analysis (p?=?0.226). Per-patient sensitivity and specificity of (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT was 78.4 %, 100 %, and for (18)F-FDG PET-CT was 86.3 %, 90.9 %, respectively. Out of 186 lesions detected by both PET-CTs, 121/186 (65 %) lesions were seen on (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT and 168/186 (90.3 %) lesions on (18)F-FDG PET-CT (p?<?0.0001). There were 103/186 (55 %) lesions concordant on both. Excellent agreement was noted between (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT and (18)F-FDG PET-CT for detection of local disease (??=?0.92), while moderate agreement was noted for nodal and pulmonary disease (??=?0.67). (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT changed management in 21/62 (34 %) patients and (18)F-FDG PET-CT in 17/62 (27 %) patients.Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT is inferior to (18)F-FDG PET-CT on lesion based but not on patient based analysis for detection of recurrent/residual disease in DTC patients with negative WBS scan and elevated serum Tg levels. It can also help in selection of potential candidates for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562651","annotations":[{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.437704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1762","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1762"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Serialism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism"},{"name":"2160s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2160s"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Drug reference standard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_reference_standard"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Work breakdown structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
