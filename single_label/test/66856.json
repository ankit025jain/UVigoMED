{"id":66856,"title":"[Molecular lymph node staging in prostate and bladder cancer].","abstract":"A positive lymph node status is a major prognostic factor for tumor recurrence and mortality following radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients or radical cystectomy in bladder cancer patients. However, despite having histopathologic negative lymph nodes, a substantial proportion of patient suffers from tumor recurrence within a few years after the operation. Tumor recurrence in node-negative patients may result from hematogeneous or lymphatic metastatic spread which remains undetected by standard clinical or histopathologic examinations. Molecular lymph node analysis is a potential method for detection of lymph node metastases with higher sensitivity and for prognostic risk stratification of patients with histopathologic negative lymph nodes.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671247","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.562133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.530003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.499628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.434709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
