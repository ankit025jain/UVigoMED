{"id":67693,"title":"[Methodological complexity of surgical trials].","abstract":"A better understanding of the complexities surrounding the evaluation of surgical interventions would improve the quality of surgical research. Particularly, in the Netherlands, there are many examples of good clinical surgical randomised trials, including the study by Labrie et al., which is discussed in this issue of the Dutch Journal of Medicine. Hopefully, these studies can contribute to the required guidelines in generating systematic, well-designed, well-executed, and well-reported surgical studies, which will further improve the quality and efficiency of care.
