{"id":26060,"title":"[Gender and subclinical vascular organ damage in patients with coronary artery disease and/or hypertension].","abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death for both women and men. Because of them, each year in Poland die about 82.000 men and 91.000 women, which is 43% of all deaths in men and 54% of all deaths in women. The risk of heart disease in women is still underestimated. 200 patients were examined. They were classified into one of four groups (25 women and 25 men in each group). In the population there were evaluated: patients' age, BMI, the number of pack-years and number of patients treated with a statin; biochemical parameters: total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, urea, creatinine, eGFR, uric acid, hs-CRP. The hemodynamic characteristics were evaluated: ABI, IMT and PWV. The study showed that ABI and IMT were significant correlated in women with hypertension (with or without concomitant coronary artery disease). On the other hand, this correlation in patients with coronary artery disease (without concomitant hypertension) was significant only in men. Moreover, women with hypertension (without concomitant coronary heart disease) had significantly lower levels of serum uric acid than men and significantly less subclinical organ damage assessed by IMT and PWV measurements. Meanwhile the ABI was not significantly different in women and men, regardless of the presence of coronary artery disease or hypertension.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154207","annotations":[{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.82295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.766547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.679271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.661658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.562149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.500467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.103332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
