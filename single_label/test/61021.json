{"id":61021,"title":"Impact of Epoetin-beta on anemia and health-related quality of life in cancer patients: a prospective observational study using the generic 15D instrument.","abstract":"Cancer-related anemia has a negative impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Our aim was to evaluate prospectively the effect of treatment of anemia with an erythropoietin on the hemoglobin level and HRQoL in cancer patients with anemia.Consecutive patients (N=114) treated for the first time with epoetin (epoetin beta 30000 IU/wk, NeoRecormonÂ®) for anemia during cancer treatment were eligible for study inclusion. Baseline characteristics were collected from patients' records. HRQoL was measured by the generic 15D instrument and fatigue by visual analogue scale (VAS) at baseline and four months from the start of the treatment with epoetin. The majority (87%) of patients had solid tumors; 69% with a metastatic disease and 89% disease with comorbidities.The mean hemoglobin concentration (SD) in blood increased from 96.6 (8.9) g/L to 112.9 (21.2) g/L, by 16.5 (20.6) g/L (p<0.0001). The mean 15D score rose from 0.72 to 0.77. The change was statistically significant (p=0.0047) and clinically important. The mean fatigue VAS score decreased by 16.0 points, or from 55.4 to 38.4 (+24.4) (p<0.0001).Correction of anemia increased the health-related quality of life in anemic cancer patients, as measured with the generic 15D instrument and the fatigue VAS.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778039","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.841418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.606059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.160705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.064482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Epoetin beta","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoetin_beta"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Corrector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrector"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
