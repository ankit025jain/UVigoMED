{"id":35677,"title":"Alterations of ectonucleotidases and acetylcholinesterase activities in lymphocytes of Down syndrome subjects: relation with inflammatory parameters.","abstract":"Subjects with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune disorders. ATP, adenosine, and acetylcholine contribute to the immune response regulation, and NTPDase, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are important enzymes in the control of the extracellular levels of these molecules. We evaluated the activities of these enzymes and the cytokine levels in samples of DS individuals.The population consisted of 23 subjects with DS and 23 healthy subjects. Twelve milliliters of blood was obtained from each subject and used for lymphocyte and serum preparation. Lymphocytes were separated on Ficoll density gradients. After isolation, NTPDase and AChE activities were determined.The NTPDase activity using ADP as substrate was increased in lymphocytes of DS patients compared to control (P<0.05); however, no alterations were observed in the ATP hydrolysis. An increase was observed in the AChE activity in lymphocytes and in ADA activity in serum of DS patients when compared to healthy subjects (P<0.05). In DS subjects, an increase in the levels of IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-? and IFN-? and a decrease in the IL-10 levels were also observed (P<0.05).Alterations in the NTPDase, ADA and AChE activities as well changes in the cytokine levels may contribute to immunological alterations observed in DS.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631131","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.948051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.902432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase","weight":0.879512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.861799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.705162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adenosine diphosphate","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.675823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Adenosine deaminase","weight":0.596119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_deaminase"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Deamination","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deamination"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"ATP hydrolysis","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_hydrolysis"}]}
