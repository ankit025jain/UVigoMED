{"id":77758,"title":"Awareness regarding otitis media in patients belonging to rural population of Raichur district, Karnataka.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to assess awareness regarding otitis media in patients of rural parts of Raichur district, Karnataka. Patients of otitis media attending village health check-up camps conducted by our department were given questionnaire to assess the awareness regarding otitis media. Association between sociodemographic parameters and awareness were studied using Chi-square test. Age group of 10-30 years was the most affected. More than half of the patients had ear discharge of 5 to 15 years duration. Over 50% of the population showed ignorance with regard to the risk factors for otitis media. Earache was either disregarded (32%) or treated with home remedies by most, (63%) while a doctor's opinion was often sought for ear discharge (60%). Lack of awareness about otitis media contributes to its' high prevalence in this South Indian district. Health education is essential to reduce the disease burden.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154150","annotations":[{"name":"Karnataka","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.355747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Raichur district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raichur_district"},{"name":"Districts of India","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_India"},{"name":"Raichur","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raichur"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"1030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1030"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Ignorance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorance"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Earache Records","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earache_Records"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Home remedy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_remedy"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"}]}
