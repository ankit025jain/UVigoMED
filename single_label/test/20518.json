{"id":20518,"title":"Invasive Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium infections, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2007-2011.","abstract":"Infection with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium sequence type (ST) 313 is associated with high rates of drug resistance, bloodstream infections, and death. To determine whether ST313 is dominant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we studied 180 isolates collected during 2007-2011; 96% belonged to CRISPOL type CT28, which is associated with ST313.
