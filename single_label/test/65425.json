{"id":65425,"title":"Association between NQO1 C609T polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.","abstract":"Published studies on the association between NQO1 C609T polymorphism and prostate cancer risk have yielded conflicting results. Thus, a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies were performed to assess the possible association. All eligible studies of NQO1 C609T polymorphism and prostate cancer risk were collected from the PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Statistical analyses were performed by Review Manage 5.0 and Stata 11.0. A total of 6 available studies were considered in the present meta-analysis, with 717 cases and 1,794 controls. When all groups were pooled, there was no evidence that NQO1 C609T had significant association with prostate cancer under additive, recessive, dominant, and allelic models. When stratifying for the race, our analysis suggested that NQO1 C609T was associated with prostate cancer risk in Asians when using dominant (TT + CT vs CC: OR?=?1.419, 95 % CI?=?1.053?-?1.913, P?=?0.021) and allelic models (OR?=?1.337, 95 % CI?=?1.014?-?1.763, P?=?0.040) to analyze the data. However, no significant associations were found in Caucasians. This meta-analysis suggested that NQO1 C609T polymorphism most likely contributes to increased susceptibility to prostate cancer in the Asians. Further large-scale and well-designed case-control studies are necessary to validate the risk identified in the present meta-analysis.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838947","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.632123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.558843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.510473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.355374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.352526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.196874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.139135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Table tennis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis"},{"name":"763","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/763"},{"name":"794","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/794"},{"name":"913","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/913"},{"name":"337","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/337"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Stratification (water)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(water)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Manage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manage"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Uncial 0141","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0141"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
