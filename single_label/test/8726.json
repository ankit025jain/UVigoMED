{"id":8726,"title":"Complete genome sequence of a novel calicivirus from a goose.","abstract":"A novel goose calicivirus (GoCV) was sequenced. The 8013-nt-long genome was organized into two open reading frames that were in the same frame and separated by 3 nucleotides. This feature is similar to what has been observed in turkey calicivirus (TuCV). Comparison of GoCV with other caliciviruses showed that it shared the highest amino acid sequence identities of 62, 38, and 52% in the nonstructural protein, VP1, and VP2, respectively, with TuCV. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of nonstructural protein and VP1 demonstrated that GoCV was most closely related to but distinct from TuCV. Thus, GoCV was identified as a novel member in the proposed genus Nacovirus.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756346","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Reading frame","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Caliciviridae","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliciviridae"},{"name":"Goose","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose"},{"name":"Turkey (bird)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"VP Records","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP_Records"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Viral nonstructural protein","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_nonstructural_protein"}]}
