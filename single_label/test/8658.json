{"id":8658,"title":"A comparison of vasopressin, terlipressin, and lactated ringers for resuscitation of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock in an animal model.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to compare the effect of lactated ringer (LR), vasopressin (Vaso) or terlipressin (Terli) on uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (UHS) in rats.48 rats were divided into four treatment groups for UHS study. Vaso group was given bolus vasopressin (0.8 U/kg); the Terli group was given bolus terlipressin (15 mcg/kg); LR group was given LR and the sham group was not given anything. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum lactate level, plasma cytokine levels, lung injury and mortality are investigated for these different treatment groups.Compared with LR group, vasopressin and terlipressin-treated groups were associated with higher MAP, lowered mortality rates, less lung injury, lowered serum lactate level, less proinflammatory and more anti-inflammatory cytokine production at certain time points. Comparing between vasopressin and terlipressin treated groups, there is no statistical difference in mortality rates, lung injury, serum lactate level and cytokine level. However, there is a difference in the length of time in maintaining a restored level of MAP (80 to 110 mmHg). The terlipressin treated rats can maintain this restored level of MAP for 45 minutes, but the vasopressin treated rats can only maintain this restored level of MAP for 5 minutes before decreasing gradually to the MAP observed in LR group (40 mmHg).Early optimization of hemodynamics with terlipressin or vasopressin in an animal model of UHS was associated with improved hemodynamics and inflammatory cytokine profile than the LR control. Compared with vasopressin, terlipressin has the advantage of ease of use and sustained effects.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24759799","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Vasopressin","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.838133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Mean arterial pressure","weight":0.759502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_arterial_pressure"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.748144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.742257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.577993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.574637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.564519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.528835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.447452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Terlipressin","weight":0.388203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terlipressin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.352303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"}]}
