{"id":74780,"title":"Statins reduce peri-procedural complications in carotid stenting.","abstract":"In primary and secondary prevention, statins significantly reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Pre-interventional statin medication shows a benefit in carotid artery stenosis patients treated with endarterectomy; however, there are few data available for patients treated with stent-angioplasty. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pre-interventional statin therapy is associated with decreased peri-interventional risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality in patients undergoing stent-angioplasty for internal carotid stenosis.Data for 344 consecutively documented patients with internal carotid artery stenosis treated with stent-angioplasty in the years 2002-2012 at the same stroke center were collected in a prospectively defined database. Risk factors, medication, and indication for therapy were documented. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to investigate independent reduction of peri-interventional stroke, myocardial infarction, or death by statin medication prior to stent-angioplasty.The median age was 70 years (p25: 63, p75: 76), 75.5% of patients were male, and the median stenosis was 85% according to ECST criteria (p25: 80%, p75: 90%). 20.1% of patients had asymptomatic stenoses, and 60.2% had statin medication before stenting. As per multivariate analysis, pre-interventional statin medication was a predictor for significant peri-interventional risk reduction regarding primary endpoint ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or death (odds ratio (OR) 0.31, p = .006). Statins also had a significant protective effect in secondary endpoint ischemic stroke, intracranial bleeding or death (OR 0.39, p = .014), and ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction (OR 0.20; p = .002).This study shows that pre-interventional statin medication has a protective effect against peri-interventional stroke, MI, or death in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis treated with stent-angioplasty. Accordingly, statins could be considered as a standard pre-interventional medical therapy in carotid stenting.","date":"2014-12-05","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240903","annotations":[{"name":"Statin","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.887116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Internal carotid artery","weight":0.865376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Carotid artery stenosis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_artery_stenosis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Intracranial hemorrhage","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.726487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.669255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.662524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Carotid stenting","weight":0.203986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_stenting"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.188234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Endarterectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endarterectomy"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
