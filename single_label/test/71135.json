{"id":71135,"title":"Racial disparities in cancer care in the Veterans Affairs health care system and the role of site of care.","abstract":"We assessed cancer care disparities within the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system and whether between-hospital differences explained disparities.We linked VA cancer registry data with VA and Medicare administrative data and examined 20 cancer-related quality measures among Black and White veterans diagnosed with colorectal (n?=?12,897), lung (n?=?25,608), or prostate (n?=?38,202) cancer from 2001 to 2004. We used logistic regression to assess racial disparities for each measure and hospital fixed-effects models to determine whether disparities were attributable to between- or within-hospital differences.Compared with Whites, Blacks had lower rates of early-stage colon cancer diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]?=?0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?0.72, 0.90), curative surgery for stage I, II, or III rectal cancer (AOR?=?0.57; 95% CI?=?0.41, 0.78), 3-year survival for colon cancer (AOR?=?0.75; 95% CI?=?0.62, 0.89) and rectal cancer (AOR?=?0.61; 95% CI?=?0.42, 0.87), curative surgery for early-stage lung cancer (AOR?=?0.50; 95% CI?=?0.41, 0.60), 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiation (3-D CRT/IMRT; AOR?=?0.53; 95% CI?=?0.47, 0.59), and potent antiemetics for highly emetogenic chemotherapy (AOR?=?0.87; 95% CI?=?0.78, 0.98). Adjustment for hospital fixed-effects minimally influenced racial gaps except for 3-D CRT/IMRT (AOR?=?0.75; 95% CI?=?0.65, 0.87) and potent antiemetics (AOR?=?0.95; 95% CI?=?0.82, 1.10).Disparities in VA cancer care were observed for 7 of 20 measures and were primarily attributable to within-hospital differences.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25100422","annotations":[{"name":"Lung
