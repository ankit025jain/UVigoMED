{"id":53231,"title":"Influence of age and gender on lipid accumulation product and its relation to diabetes mellitus in Japanese.","abstract":"Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is a recently proposed good discriminator for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The aim of this study was to clarify how age and gender influence LAP and its relation to diabetes.Subjects (18,793 women and 35,684 men) were divided by age into 4 groups of 35-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, and 60-70 years. LAP was compared among the age groups and between women and men.In women, LAP tended to be higher with an increase in age after 35-39 years, while LAP in men was highest in the middle-aged group (40-49 years) and declined after 50 years. LAP was lower in women than in men in the younger groups and was higher in women than in men in the oldest group. The odds ratio for diabetes of subjects with vs. those without high LAP levels was significantly higher than the reference level of 1.00 and tended to be higher in women than in men and to be lower with an increase in age both in women and men.LAP and its association with diabetes are influenced by both age and gender.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530297","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.539226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.233004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.178789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lesbian","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"793","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/793"},{"name":"684","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/684"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
