{"id":80804,"title":"A rapid sensitive, flow cytometry-based method for the detection of Plasmodium vivax-infected blood cells.","abstract":"Plasmodium vivax preferentially infects Duffy-positive reticulocytes and infections typically have few parasite-infected cells in the peripheral circulation. These features complicate detection and quantification by flow cytometry (FC) using standard nucleic acid-based staining methods. A simple antibody-based FC method was developed for rapid parasite detection along with simultaneous detection of other parasite and erythrocyte markers.Clinical samples were collected from patients diagnosed with P. vivax at a district Malaria Clinic in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. One ?L of infected blood was washed, fixed, stained with a Plasmodium pan-specific anti-PfBiP antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 660, and analysed by FC. Additional primary conjugated antibodies for stage-specific markers of P. vivax for late trophozoite-early schizonts (MSP1-Alexa Fluor 660), late-stage schizonts (DBP-Alexa Fluor 555), and sexual stages (Pvs16) were used to differentiate intra-erythrocytic developmental stages.The percentages of P. vivax-infected cells determined by the FC method and manually by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick blood smears were positively correlated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (R2=0.93843) from 0.001 to 1.00% P. vivax-infected reticulocytes.The FC-based method is a simple, robust, and efficient method for detecting P. vivax-infected reticulocytes.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528780","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.809692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.701752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood film","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.566783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.501239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Reticulocyte","weight":0.458584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulocyte"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.387785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.279765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Alexa Fluor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Fluor"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Merozoite surface protein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merozoite_surface_protein"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
