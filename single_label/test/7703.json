{"id":7703,"title":"[Cartilage repair and subchondral bone reconstruction based on three-dimensional printing technique].","abstract":"To investigate whether subchondral bone microstructural parameters are related to cartilage repair during large osteochondral defect repairing based on three-dimensional (3-D) printing technique.Biomimetic biphasic osteochondral composite scaffolds were fabricated by using 3-D printing technique. The right trochlea critical sized defects (4.8 mm in diameter, 7.5 mm in depth) were created in 40 New Zealand white rabbits (aged 6 months, weighing 2.5-3.5 kg). Biomimetic biphasic osteochondral composite scaffolds were implanted into the defects in the experimental group (n = 35), and no composite scaffolds implantation served as control group (n = 5); the left side had no defect as sham-operation group. Animals of experimental and sham-operation groups were euthanized at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 52 weeks after operation, while animals of control group were sampled at 24 weeks. Subchondral bone microstructural parameters and cartilage repair were quantitatively analyzed using Micro-CT and Wayne scoring system. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were applied to reveal the relationship between subchondral bone parameters and cartilage repair. The subchondral bone parameters included bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone surface area fraction (BSA/BV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp).In the experimental group, articular cartilage repair was significantly improved at 52 weeks postoperatively, which was dominated by hyaline cartilage tissue, and tidal line formed. Wayne scores at 24 and 52 weeks were significantly higher than that at 16 weeks in the experimental group (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between at 24 and 52 weeks (P > 0.05); the scores of experimental group were significantly lower than those of sham-operation group at all time points (P < 0.05). In the experimental group, new subchondral bone migrated from the surrounding defect to the centre, and subchondral bony plate formed at 24 and 52 weeks. The microstructural parameters of repaired subchondral bone followed a \"twin peaks\" like discipline to which BV/TV, BSA/BV, and Tb.N increased at 2 and 16 weeks, and then they returned to normal level. The Tb.Sp showed reversed discipline compared to the former 3 parameters, no significant change was found for Tb.Th during the repair process. Correlation analysis showed that BV/TV, BSA/BV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and Tb.Sp were all related with gross appearance score and histology score of repaired cartilage.Subchondral bone parameters are related with cartilage repair in critical size osteochondral repair in vivo. Microstructural parameters of repaired subchondral bone follow a \"twin peaks\" like discipline (osteoplasia-remodeling-osteoplasia-remodeling) to achieve reconstruction, 2nd week and 16th week are critical time points for subchondral bone functional restoration.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Animal
