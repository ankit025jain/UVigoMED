{"id":4253,"title":"A cross-sectional study of stressors among farmers in Eastern North Carolina.","abstract":"Agriculture is a hazardous, stressful occupation that can adversely affect farmers' health. Identifying stressors among farmers may help health professionals improve health outcomes by developing targeted intervention strategies and services.Over a 4-month period, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 128 farmers in an economically disadvantaged, 29-county region of Eastern North Carolina. We used a modified version of the Farm Ranch Stress Inventory to measure farmers' self-reported reactions to potential stressors.The majority of farmers surveyed were aged 40-59 years, had farmed for more than 20 years, and worked more than 40 hours per week on the farm. Large proportions of respondents identified the following factors as 'very stressful': concern about the weather (60.2%), concern over the future of the farm (29.7%), outsiders not understanding the nature of farming (25.2%), problems with machinery (23.4%), market prices for crops/livestock (45.3%), taxes (38.3%), health care costs (32.5%), and not having enough time to spend with family in recreation (13.3%). Experiencing 8 or more factors as \"very stressful\" was found to be positively associated with working more than 40 hours per week on the farm (P = .008) and with being a farm manager or a farm worker who does not operate equipment (P = .001).Information about perceived stressors among farmers may help health professionals develop targeted interventions for reducing stress. More research is needed to better evaluate health outcomes, to reduce farm-related injuries, and to improve psychosocial well-being.","date":"2014-11-18","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25402689","annotations":[{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.638537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Tax","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.531971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Ranch","weight":0.313988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.305179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Weather","weight":0.203381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.107842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Fish farming","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming"},{"name":"Agricultural science","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_science"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.0627902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Dangerous goods","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods"},{"name":"Ranch-style house","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch-style_house"},{"name":"Farmworker","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmworker"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Disadvantaged","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disadvantaged"},{"name":"Province of Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Carolina"},{"name":"Military occupation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Outsourcing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing"},{"name":"Economic interventionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"}]}
