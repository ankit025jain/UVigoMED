{"id":88652,"title":"The structure of trauma patients, its management and health care in the University Hospital of Alexandroupolis.","abstract":"The present study was designed to describe the patterns of trauma patients using a newly-introduced trauma registry, as well as retrospectively assess the management and outcome facts of these patients.The study included 2346 patients (62.15% male) with a mean age of 34.06 +/- 23.77 years. Of these patients, 355 were multiple trauma patients. Privately owned vehicles were used as a mode of transportation for most of the trauma patients (96.65%). Data regarding patient demographics, arrival at the Emergency Department, mechanism of injury, injury severity, anatomical location and type of injury were collected and analyzed.Falls were the most prevalent mechanism of injury, accounting for 62.19% of the total admitted cases, with other causes (that also included occupational accidents and machinery trauma) being the second most prevalent, and MVAs--the third with a rate of 11.46%. The most commonly injured body regions were the extremities (50.26%), the head (42.50%), and the torso (19.39%). Fractures represented 11.46% of the injuries, while open wounds were much more frequent (29.41%). The mean abbreviated injury severity (AIS) score was 1.78 +/- 1.48 for all admitted patients and 3.56 +/- 1.02 for multiple trauma patients. A multi-disciplinary approach was required for 23% of the multiple trauma patients. The clinic admission rate for the whole patient sample was 13.55% and 48.96% for multiple trauma patients. The mean duration of stay for all clinic admissions was 2.7 days and 2.9 days for multiple trauma patients.With the epidemiology of trauma in Greece being rather poorly investigated, the present study manages to identify the major epidemiological patterns of trauma cases presenting to a tertiary regional hospital and addresses the need for development and implementation of injury prevention activities and policies.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and
