{"id":15428,"title":"Oral-resident natural Th17 cells and ?? T cells control opportunistic Candida albicans infections.","abstract":"Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. OPC is frequent in HIV/AIDS, implicating adaptive immunity. Mice are naive to Candida, yet IL-17 is induced within 24 h of infection, and susceptibility is strongly dependent on IL-17R signaling. We sought to identify the source of IL-17 during the early innate response to candidiasis. We show that innate responses to Candida require an intact TCR, as SCID, IL-7R?(-/-), and Rag1(-/-) mice were susceptible to OPC, and blockade of TCR signaling by cyclosporine induced susceptibility. Using fate-tracking IL-17 reporter mice, we found that IL-17 is produced within 1-2 d by tongue-resident populations of ?? T cells and CD3(+)CD4(+)CD44(hi)TCR?(+)CCR6(+) natural Th17 (nTh17) cells, but not by TCR-deficient innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) or NK cells. These cells function redundantly, as TCR-?(-/-) and TCR-?(-/-) mice were both resistant to OPC. Whereas ?? T cells were previously shown to produce IL-17 during dermal candidiasis and are known to mediate host defense at mucosal surfaces, nTh17 cells are poorly understood. The oral nTh17 population expanded rapidly after OPC, exhibited high TCR-? clonal diversity, and was absent in Rag1(-/-), IL-7R?(-/-), and germ-free mice. These findings indicate that nTh17 and ?? T cells, but not ILCs, are key mucosal sentinels that control oral pathogens.
