{"id":81452,"title":"Effect of platelet-rich fibrin on frequency of alveolar osteitis following mandibular third molar surgery: a double-blinded randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in preventing the development of alveolar osteitis (AO).In a double-blinded study, patients with bilateral impacted mandibular third molars underwent surgical extractions, with one socket receiving PRF and the other one serving as a control. The surgeon and patient were unaware of the study or control side. The predictor variable was the PRF application and was categorized as PRF and non-PRF. The outcome variable was the development of AO during the first postoperative week. Other study variables included age, gender, smoking status, irrigation volume, extraction difficulty, surgeon experience, and number of anesthetic cartridges. Data were analyzed using ?(2) and t tests, with the significance level set at a P value less than .05.Seventy-eight patients (mean age, 25 yr) underwent 156 impacted third molar surgeries. The overall frequency of AO was 14.74% for all surgeries. The frequency of AO in the PRF group was significantly lower than in the non-PRF group (odds ratio = 0.44; P < .05).Based on the results of the present study, PRF application may decrease the risk of AO development after mandibular third molar surgery.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25037182","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.867674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.798844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.746354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.598879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.368379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.281463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Wisdom tooth","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_tooth"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Covariate","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Level set","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Cartridge (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Pulse repetition frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_repetition_frequency"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Osteitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteitis"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"}]}
