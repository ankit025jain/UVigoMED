{"id":78396,"title":"What do we know about rhinogenic headache? The otolaryngologistâ€™s challenge.","abstract":"Sinus headache is a common presenting complaint in the otolaryngology office. Although most patients with this presentation are found to have migraine headache, many do not, and others fail therapy. This review focuses on the current understanding of nonneoplastic rhinogenic headache: headaches that are caused or exacerbated by nasal or paranasal sinus disease or anatomy. The literature regarding this topic is reviewed, along with a review of surgical series seeking to correct these abnormalities and the outcomes obtained with intervention. Suggestions are provided regarding patient diagnosis and management, and options for intervention are reviewed.
