{"id":56797,"title":"Frequency of abnormal retinal nerve fibre layer  and ganglion cell layer SDOCT scans in healthy  eyes and glaucoma suspects in a prospective  longitudinal study.","abstract":"To examine the frequency of abnormal retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFLT) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) measurements among healthy and glaucoma suspect and preperimetric glaucoma (GSPPG) eyes in a prospective longitudinal study.Normal and GSPPG eyes with ? 18 months follow-up were included. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) was performed annually in normal and biannually in GSPPG eyes. One eye was randomly selected for inclusion. RNFLT and GCC parameters with p>5% were classified as 'within normal limits (WNL)' and p<1% were classified as 'outside normal limits (ONL)'. RESUlts: 23 normal and 74 GSPPG eyes were followed for a mean 43.4 Â± 9.6 months. During serial follow-up, 100% and 91% of normal eyes had all RNFLT and GCC parameters classified as WNL, respectively. 27 (37%) and 17 (23%) of GSPPG eyes had an ONL classification in at least one RNFLT and GCC parameter, respectively. A high percentage (41%-56%) of RNFLT and GCC measurements classified as ONL were not replicated on subsequent scans. The rates of loss for all parameters were similar (p>0.05) between the groups.Specificity in this sample of healthy eyes was very high for RNFLT and GCC parameters. Confirmation of suspected SDOCT abnormalities is recommended to differentiate reproducible loss from long-term variability.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627246","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ganglion cell","weight":0.749607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.497652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.402288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.11378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Ganglion cell layer","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell_layer"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"GNU Compiler Collection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection"},{"name":"CW complex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex"},{"name":"Order of Newfoundland and Labrador","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"IBM System p","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_p"},{"name":"Suspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"}]}
