{"id":19815,"title":"Epidemiological characteristics of invasive meningococcal disease in the Split-Dalmatia County 1996-2010.","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to present epidemiological features of reported patients with invasive meningococcal disease in the Split-Dalmatia County in the period from January 1996 to December 2010. During the 15-year period (1996-2010), a total of 119 patients were reported to have invasive meningococcal disease, yielding a mean annual incidence rate of 1.7/100,000 inhabitants. There were 69 (58%) male and 50 (42%) female patients. Five of 119 patients died, yielding a case fatality rate of 4.2%. Among 83/119 (70%) cases with proven etiology, serogroup was determined in 56/83 (67.5%) patients, whereas in 28/83 (32.5%) patients serogroup could not be determined. The most common serogroup was B, found in 43/56 (76.8%) patients. During the 1996-2010 period, dissemination of the disease in epidemic proportions was not recorded.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697000","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.714071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.585865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.427496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.330141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Meningococcal disease","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.119397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"5th millennium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_millennium"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0163128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.0147534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 7100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7100"},{"name":"Dissemination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemination"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"}]}
