{"id":63084,"title":"Unusual intracytoplasmic crystalline inclusions in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with double minute chromosomes and MYC amplification: a rare case.","abstract":"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematological disease characterized by the presence of peripheral blood monocytosis and bone marrow dysplasia. Double minute chromosomes (dmin) are rare and intracytoplasmic crystalline inclusions are very rare in hematologic malignancies. We present a case of CMML with dmin and unusual intracytoplasmic crystalline inclusions. To our knowledge, no such case has previously been reported.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481037","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.737921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.361637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia","weight":0.183635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelomonocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Monocytosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocytosis"},{"name":"Inclusion body","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_body"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"}]}
