{"id":17198,"title":"Latent tuberculous infection prevalence among paediatric contacts of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible cases.","abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) clinic in Tijuana, MÃ©xico.Tuberculin conversion rates in contacts of drug-resistant cases have been reported to be lower than among contacts of drug-susceptible cases.To determine if the prevalence of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) among paediatric contacts of drug-resistant cases is lower than that of contacts of drug-susceptible cases.In a cross-sectional study, LTBI among paediatric contacts of culture-proven TB cases was evaluated using the tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay. Rates among contacts of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant cases were compared.The TST was positive in 83.1% of the drug-susceptible group vs. 76.0% for the drug-resistant group (P = 0.25). Using the QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay, drug-resistant cases had a higher rate of positivity than the drug-susceptible group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (42.3% positivity among drug-susceptible cases vs. 57.7% among drug-resistant cases; P = 0.48).The proportion of LTBI is similar among paediatric contacts, regardless of whether the index case is drug-resistant or -susceptible.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903785","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.677352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.438193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.430089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.351631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.32253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.252368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Tijuana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana"},{"name":"QuantiFERON","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuantiFERON"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Index case","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Conversion rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"}]}
