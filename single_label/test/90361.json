{"id":90361,"title":"School-related fractures.","abstract":"Introduction of daily PE classes has been proposed as a measure to reduce childhood obesity. At the same time, the prevalence of activity-related fractures among children is increasing. Previously, we have found that the fracture rate per 10,000 hours of activity amounted to 1.9 for snowboarding, 0.79 for handball, 0.44 for football and 0.35 for trampolining. The purpose of the study is to describe the prevalence of school-related fractures, as well to investigate whether PE exposes schoolchildren aged 6-16 to a heightened risk of fractures when compared to other activities.Fractures in children aged 6-16 resident in the catchment area of Akershus University Hospital were recorded over a 12-month period. Information on fractures sustained at school, defined as fractures that occurred during school hours, during supervised after-school activities (SFO) or on the way to or from school, was retrieved from the records. The fractures were classified according to activity, time of the school day when the injuries occurred and their anatomical location.Of a total of 1,144 fractures registered among children aged 6-16, altogether 422 (37%) were school-related, equivalent to 8.5 per 1000 children. Of these, 257 (61%) were in boys. Altogether 276 (65.4%) fractures occurred outdoors, 135 (32%) occurred during breaks and 94 (22.3%) during PE classes. The fracture rate for PE amounted to 0.29 fractures per 10,000 hours (95% CI: 0.22-0.33).The fracture rate for PE classes is lower than for a number of other common leisure activities. As a measure to increase children's physical activity, the introduction of daily PE classes will be a beneficial alternative with a view to the risk of injury.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621909","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Snowboarding","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Team handball","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_handball"},{"name":"Physical education","weight":0.272202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"School","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Leisure","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Akershus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akershus"},{"name":"Trampolining","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampolining"},{"name":"Akershus University Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akershus_University_Hospital"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Wilderness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Extracurricular activity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_activity"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"San Francisco International Airport","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
