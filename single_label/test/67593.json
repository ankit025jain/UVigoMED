{"id":67593,"title":"Urinary serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 reflects renal injury in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy.","abstract":"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 functions as an important regulator of transepithelial sodium transport by activating epithelial sodium channel in renal tubules. Considerable evidence demonstrated that SGK1 was associated with hypertension and fibrosing diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. The present study was performed to evaluate the role of SGK1 played in immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy.Seventy-six patients of biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and 33 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. All patients and healthy volunteers' urinary and serum samples were tested for SGK1 expression by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Meanwhile all patients' renal tissues were semi-quantified for SGK1 expression by immunohistochemistry assay. The relationships between SGK1 expressions and clinical or pathological parameters were also assessed.SGK1 expression was upregulated in urine and renal tubules in patients of Oxford classification T1 and T2, whereas its expression in serum did not increase significantly. Relationship analysis indicated that urinary and tissue SGK1 expressions were associated with heavy proteinuria and renal insufficiency in patients with IgA nephropathy. On the other hand, RAS blockades would reduce the SGK1 levels both in urine and renal tissues.These results suggested that urinary SGK1 should be a good indicator of tubulointerstitial damage in patients of IgA nephropathy. SGK1 expressions in urine and renal tissues were associated with the activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602173","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"IgA nephropathy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA_nephropathy"},{"name":"Diabetic nephropathy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.77286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Sodium channel","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.323981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.160579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Epithelial sodium channel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_sodium_channel"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Oxford","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Relaxation (NMR)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
