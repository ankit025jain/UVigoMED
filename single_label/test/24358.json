{"id":24358,"title":"Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens-induced bacteremia in a healthy man.","abstract":"Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens is rarely associated with bacteremia but results in significant mortality. Almost all reported bacteremia cases have occurred in immunocompromised hosts, such as those with alcoholic liver disease, atherosclerosis, recent surgery, malignancies, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We describe here, to our knowledge, the first clinical evidence for A succiniciproducens bacteremia in a healthy man. A 61-year-old man had fallen from a roof and was admitted to our emergency department with severe left flank pain without an external wound. He was given transcatheter arterial embolization for the left kidney injury on the same day, and his condition stabilized. Four days after admission, he had fever without gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. Spiral-shaped, gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 2 sets of blood cultures, and the oxidase and catalase test results were negative. The isolated bacteria were different from the Campylobacter spp. On the next day, the bacteria were confirmed as A succiniciproducens by 16S rRNA sequencing. The patient responded to sulbactam/ampicillin. On day 13, the patient was discharged with a 7-day prescription for oral amoxicillin/clavulanate. Six months after admission, the patient was free of recurrent infection. A succiniciproducens bacteremia can occur in healthy adults. When large gram-negative spiral-shaped bacteria are detected, this bacterial species should be considered and differentiated from the Campylobacter spp because A succiniciproducens is often resistant to macrolide antibiotics.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
