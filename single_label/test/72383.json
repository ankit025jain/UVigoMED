{"id":72383,"title":"[Quality assessment of radiologic reports of CT examinations for tumor response evaluation].","abstract":"Our purpose was to assess the quality of radiologic reports of CT scans performed for tumor response evaluation before and after corrective procedure.Our objective was to assess the presence of different items in radiologic reports of CT scans performed for tumor response evaluation. The present evaluation was formal, that is to say without checking the accuracy of the items identified. Ten simple items were evaluated before and after corrective procedure corresponding to an oral and written information concerning the tumor response evaluation technique with CT.The results were variable depending on the items measured. Most of the criteria were improved after corrective procedure. But for some items the result remained poor or very poor as the appropriate choice of comparison review (baseline or nadir).In the absence of use of the standard form, the feedback of the quality of radiologic reports of CT scans performed for tumor response evaluation shows that the quality remains largely suboptimal even after corrective procedure.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977444","annotations":[{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.485089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.217529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.145792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.128596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.0315646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Cheque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheque"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
