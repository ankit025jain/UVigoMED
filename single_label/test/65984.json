{"id":65984,"title":"[Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for advanced penile cancer: a case report].","abstract":"54-year-old male was introduced to our hospital in January 2012 for surgical treatment and chemotherapy. The pathological examination revealed well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated right inguinal and pelvic lymphadenopathy. We diagnosed the tumor to be unresectable radically and administered paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After 3 courses of chemotherapy, the size of lymphadenopathy had become small enough to allow curative surgical treatment. Partial penectomy and lymph node dissection were performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For 12 months after this radical treatment, the patient has been healthy with no local resurrence and no distant metastatic lesion. TPF chemotherapy for unresectable nodal metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of penis was suggested to be effective.
