{"id":43131,"title":"Predictive factors for successful sacral nerve stimulation in the treatment of fecal incontinence: lessons from a comprehensive treatment assessment.","abstract":"Sacral nerve stimulation has a place in the treatment algorithm for fecal incontinence, but the predictive factors of its midterm and long-term success are unknown.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 3-year sacral nerve stimulation treatment of fecal continence and to identify specific predictive factors from the pretreatment and per-treatment assessments for the midterm success of sacral nerve stimulation.A cohort analysis of consecutive patients treated with sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence over a period of 3 years was performed.This study was conducted at an academic colorectal unit in a tertiary care center.Sixty patients were available for the assessment of 3-year outcomes.Clinical outcome (including Cleveland Clinic score) and anorectal physiological data were collected prospectively before and after treatment.At the 3-year follow-up, 33 of the 60 implanted patients had an improved outcome as defined by a ?30% improvement in the Cleveland Clinic score from baseline (37.1% on intention to treat and 55.0% per protocol), whereas 22 had an unsuccessful outcome as defined by a <30% improvement in the Cleveland Clinic score from baseline (24.7% on intention to treat and 36.7% per protocol), of whom 7 had their device explanted or switched off permanently before the 3-year assessment, and 3 were lost at follow-up. At 3 years, we failed to identify any factors that could predict the 3-year clinical outcome of sacral nerve stimulation based on preimplantation and postimplantation assessments.This study involved a relatively small number of patients. There was a lack of consistency in the tool used to evaluate the efficacy of the test and permanent stimulations.Based on per-protocol assessments, 55% of the patients had improved outcomes at the 3-year follow-up. No predictor was identified by the pretreatment and posttreatment assessments (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A133).","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807603","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Cleveland Clinic","weight":0.639643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.590197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.417115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.315878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.195016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sacral nerves","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacral_nerves"},{"name":"Intention to treat analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_to_treat_analysis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Channel 37","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_37"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cleveland","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
