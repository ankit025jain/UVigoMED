{"id":80925,"title":"Newly established monoclonal antibody diagnostic assays for Schistosoma mansoni direct detection in areas of low endemicity.","abstract":"Current available methods for diagnosis of schistosomiasis mansoni lack sufficient sensitivity, which results in underreporting of infectious in areas of low endemicity.We developed three novel diagnostic methodologies for the direct detection of schistosome infection in serum samples. These three new methods were evaluated with positive patients from a low endemicity area in southeast Brazil. The basis of the assay was the production of monoclonal antibodies against the protein backbone of heavily glycosylated Circulating Cathodic Antigen (CCA). The antibodies were also selected for having no specificity to repeating poly-Lewis x units. Assays based on the detection CCA-protein should not encounter a limitation in sensitivity due to a biological background of this particular epitope. Three diagnostic methodologies were developed and validated, (i) Immunomagnetic Separation based on improved incubation steps of non-diluted serum, (ii) Direct Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and (iii) Fluorescent Microscopy Analysis as a qualitative assay. The two quantitative assays presented high sensitivity (94% and 92%, respectively) and specificity (100%), equivalent to the analysis of 3 stool samples and 16 slides by Kato-Katz, showing promising results on the determination of cure.The Immunomagnetic Separation technique showed excellent correlation with parasite burden by Cohen coefficient. The qualitative method detected 47 positive individuals out of 50 with the analysis of 3 slides. This easy-to-do method was capable of discriminating positive from negative cases, even for patients with low parasite burden.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498191","annotations":[{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.83479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.74505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.705938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Peptide bond","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_bond"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.27995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.27769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.179322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"}]}
