{"id":47687,"title":"The chemopreventive activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor tributyrin in colon carcinogenesis involves the induction of apoptosis and reduction of DNA damage.","abstract":"The chemopreventive activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) tributyrin (TB), a prodrug of butyric acid (BA), was evaluated in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis. The animals were treated with TB (TB group: 200mg/100g of body weight, b.w.) or maltodextrin (MD isocaloric control group: 300 mg/100g b.w.) daily for 9 consecutive weeks. In the 3rd and 4th weeks of treatment, the rats in the TB and MD groups were given DMH (40 mg/kg b.w.) twice a week. After 9 weeks, the animals were euthanized, and the distal colon was examined. Compared with the control group (MD group), TB treatment reduced the total number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF; p<0.05) as well as the ACF with ?4 crypts (p<0.05), which are considered more aggressive, but not inhibited the formation of DMH-induced O6-methyldeoxyguanosine DNA adducts. The TB group also showed a higher apoptotic index (p<0.05) and reduced DNA damage (p<0.05) compared with MD group. TB acted as a HDACi, as rats treated with the prodrug of BA had higher levels of histone H3K9 acetylation compared with the MD group (p<0.05). TB administration resulted in increased colonic tissue concentrations of BA (p<0.05) compared with the control animals. These results suggest that TB can be considered a promising chemopreventive agent for colon carcinogenesis because it reduced the number of ACF, including those that were more aggressive. Induction of apoptosis and reduction of DNA damage are cellular mechanisms that appear to be involved in the chemopreventive activity of TB.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576724","annotations":[{"name":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Histone deacetylase","weight":0.885779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Prodrug","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.719351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.662881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.660954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.618291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Butyric acid","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.451527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.401782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Maltodextrin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltodextrin"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.36342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.345466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.322081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.301356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.143036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.138706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.0763854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0444368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Histone H3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H3"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Adduct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduct"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"}]}
