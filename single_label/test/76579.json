{"id":76579,"title":"[Bone metabolism and cardiovascular function update. Cross link of hypertension, bone loss and vascular calcification - common back grounds in renin angiotensin system with anti-aging aspect -].","abstract":"Hypertension, osteoporosis and vascular calcification are major diseases in the recent aging society and may share the same backgrounds genetically and environmentally. As treatments to prevent aging-related diseases simultaneously are desirable, we investigate common backgrounds underling these diseases. Renin- angiotensin system, which causes high blood pressure, is found to be involved in bone metabolism. Angiotensin II has been shown to accelerate osteoporosis through RANKL up-regulation in osteoblast. RANKL, in turn, contributes to vascular calcification by regulating bone morphogenetic protein-2 and MGP expression, as well as bone-related proteins. Angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) ameliorate osteoporosis and vascular calcification beyond their blood pressure lowering effects. These pleiotropic effects of antihypertensive drugs such as ARBs might benefit especially hypertensive postmenopausal women.
