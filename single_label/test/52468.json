{"id":52468,"title":"Variants in the ATM-CHEK2-BRCA1 axis determine genetic predisposition and clinical presentation of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","abstract":"The risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent form of thyroid malignancy, is elevated up to 8.6-fold in first-degree relatives of PTC patients. The familial risk could be explained by high-penetrance mutations in yet unidentified genes, or polygenic action of low-penetrance alleles. Since the DNA-damaging exposure to ionizing radiation is a known risk factor for thyroid cancer, polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are likely to affect this risk. In a search for low-penetrance susceptibility alleles we employed Sequenom technology to genotype deleterious polymorphisms in ATM, CHEK2, and BRCA1 in 1,781 PTC patients and 2,081 healthy controls. As a result of the study, we identified CHEK2 rs17879961 (OR?=?2.2, P?=?2.37e-10) and BRCA1 rs16941 (odds ratio [OR]?=?1.16, P?=?0.005) as risk alleles for PTC. The ATM rs1801516 variant modifies the risk associated with the BRCA1 variant by 0.78 (P?=?0.02). Both the ATM and BRCA1 variants modify the impact of male gender on clinical variables: T status (P?=?0.007), N status (P?=?0.05), and stage (P?=?0.035). Our findings implicate an important role of variants in the ATM- CHEK2- BRCA1 axis in modification of the genetic predisposition to PTC and its clinical manifestations.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599715","annotations":[{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.773947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.582523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.368677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"CHEK2","weight":0.205252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHEK2"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia mutated","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia_mutated"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Sequenom","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequenom"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
