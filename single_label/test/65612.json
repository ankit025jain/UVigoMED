{"id":65612,"title":"[Epigenetics in kidney diseases].","abstract":"Increasing evidence has demonstrated that chronic hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium results in irreversible chronic kidney diseases. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional master regulator which takes control of gene expressions under hypoxia. Recently, HIF1 has been reported to organize a cluster of histone-modifying enzymes by binding to their promoter regions in various kinds of cell line. In order to clarify the epigenetic molecular mechanisms by HIF1, we examined the genome-wide analysis of HIF1-binding sites (ChIP-seq) in endothelial cells and HIF1 downstream target genes using DNA microarrays. ChIP-seq results demonstrated that HIF1 binds to the enhancer regions in addition to the promoter regions. We clarified that one of the HIF1 downstream genes, SLC2A3 (solute-carrier family 2A3, also known as glucose transporter 3: GLUT3), is regulated by changing chromosomal conformations under hypoxia via a cooperative combination of HIF1 and KDM3A(lysine(K) specific demethylase 3A), one of the histone demethylases. KDM3A is recruited to the SLC2A3 loci in an HIF1-dependent manner and demethylates histone repressive mark, H3K9me2, up-regulating its expression. In addition, we confirmed the interactions of HIF1 and KDM3A only under hypoxia using co-immunoprecipitation. These experimental results showed novel HIF1-dependent molecular mechanisms from an epigenetic viewpoint. It is important to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms of chronic hypoxia in order to identify novel therapeutic approaches against chronic kidney disease.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male
