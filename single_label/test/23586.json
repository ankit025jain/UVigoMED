{"id":23586,"title":"A cost-effective approach for detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile: toxigenic culture using ChromID Clostridium difficile agar.","abstract":"We evaluated the performance and the cost of toxigenic culture using a commercial chromogenic medium (CDIF) for 538 stool specimens. Compared with real-time PCR, this method was found to detect an additional 9% of positive specimens and result in 61% reduction in material costs, with a trade-off increase in turnaround time of 1 day.
