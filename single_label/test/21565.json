{"id":21565,"title":"Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and cerebral infarction risk: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and the risk of cerebral infarction have been previously studied in several publications; however, conflicting results have been reported. This meta-analysis assessed whether C.?pneumoniae infection was associated with risk of cerebral infarction.Systematic computerized searches of the PubMed and Web of Knowledge were performed. Adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval from original studies were extracted for combined meta-analysis.Twenty-three studies with 2924 cerebral infarction patients and 4692 control patients were included in the meta-analysis. When the positive C.?pneumoniae infection was defined by microimmunofluorescence-detected immunoglobulin A, the pooled odds ratio between two groups was 2.04 (95% confidence interval 1.42-2.9). In the most frequently used immunoglobulin A ?1:16 sub-group, the pooled odds ratio was 2.07 (95% confidence interval 1.31-3.26). When the infection was defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-detected immunoglobulin A, the pooled odds ratio was 2.89 (95% confidence interval 1.23-6.81). When the infection was defined by microimmunofluorescence-detected immunoglobulin G, the pooled odds ratio was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.18-1.81). In the most frequently used immunoglobulin G ?1:32 sub-group, the pooled odds ratio was 1.43 (95% confidence interval 1.06-1.92). When the infection was defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-detected immunoglobulin G, the pooled odds ratio was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.86-2.74). No significant publication bias was found. Sensitivity analyses showed the results were robust.(1) This meta-analysis indicated that C.?pneumoniae infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of cerebral infarction. (2) Compared with anti-C.?pneumoniae immunoglobulin G, anti-C.?pneumoniae immunoglobulin A seemed more effective for predicting the risk of cerebral infarction. (3) No evidence existed that anti-C.?pneumoniae-immunoglobulin G detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay could predict the risk of cerebral infarction.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597545","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.890249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.811032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.781175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chlamydia infection","weight":0.707151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_infection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.682669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.420661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Chlamydophila pneumoniae","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydophila_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.167344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cerebral infarction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction"},{"name":"ISI Web of Knowledge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISI_Web_of_Knowledge"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"862","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/862"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_1"},{"name":"The New Era","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Era"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
