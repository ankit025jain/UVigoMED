{"id":37149,"title":"Diagnosis of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency by measuring 3-O-methyldopa concentrations in dried blood spots.","abstract":"Inherited defects that affect the synthesis or metabolism of neurotransmitters cause severe motor dysfunction. The diagnosis of these diseases, including aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, typically requires cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitter analysis. However, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), which is a catabolic product of L-dopa that accumulates in individuals with AADC deficiency, can be detected in blood.3-OMD concentrations were measured in dried blood spots (DBSs). One 3.2-mm punch was eluted with 90% methanol containing a deuterated internal standard (3-OMD-d3), and then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).3-OMD in DBSs was shown to be stable for more than 28 days at 37Â°C. We measured DBS 3-OMD concentrations in controls and patients with AADC deficiency. 3-OMD concentrations in normal newborns and children decreased with age. Patients with AADC deficiency revealed >15-fold increase of DBS 3-OMD concentrations. Archive newborn screening DBS samples, obtained from 6 patients with AADC deficiency, revealed more than 19-fold increase of 3-OMD concentrations.We demonstrated that DBS 3-OMD concentrations were highly elevated in newborns and children with AADC deficiency. Because 3-OMD is stable in DBS, this method can be used for both high risk and newborn screening of AADC deficiency.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
