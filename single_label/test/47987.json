{"id":47987,"title":"GIPR expression in gastric and duodenal neuroendocrine tumors.","abstract":"Compounds targeting somatostatin-receptor-type-2 (SSTR2) are useful for small bowel neuroendocrine tumor (SBNET) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) imaging and treatment. We recently characterized expression of 13 cell surface receptor genes in SBNETs and PNETs, identifying three drug targets (GIPR, OXTR, and OPRK1). This study set out to characterize expression of this gene panel in the less common neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach and duodenum (gastric and duodenal neuroendocrine tumors [GDNETs]).Primary tumors and adjacent normal tissue were collected at surgery, RNA was extracted, and expression of 13 target genes was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression was normalized to GAPDH and POLR2A internal control genes. Expression relative to normal tissue (ddCT) and absolute expression (dCT) were calculated. Wilcoxon tests compared median expression with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons.Gene expression was similar in two gastric and seven duodenal tumors, and these were analyzed together. Like SBNETs (n = 63) and PNETs (n = 51), GDNETs showed significant overexpression compared with normal tissue of BRS3, GIPR, GRM1, GPR113, OPRK1, and SSTR2 (P < 0.05 for all). Of these, SSTR2 had the highest absolute expression in GDNETs (median dCT 4.0). Absolute expression of BRS3, GRM1, GPR113, and OPRK1 was significantly lower than SSTR2 in GDNETs (P < 0.05 for all), whereas expression of GIPR was similar to SSTR2 (median 4.3, P = 0.4).As in SBNETs and PNETs, GIPR shows absolute expression close to SSTR2 but has greater overexpression relative to normal tissue (21.1 versus 3.5-fold overexpression). We conclude that GIPR could provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio for imaging versus SSTR2 and represents a promising novel therapeutic target in GDNETs.","date":"2014-07-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565507","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.901657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.837401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.728037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.677915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Primitive neuroectodermal tumor","weight":0.429552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.258524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Multiple comparisons","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor_1"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
