{"id":68407,"title":"[Prevention of postprostatectomy incontinence: etiology and risk factors].","abstract":"The prevention of postprostatectomy incontinence has always been a challenge for urologists. Improved understanding of male continence and changes in pelvic anatomy after radical prostatectomy and the implementation of new surgical techniques raised hope of reduced incontinence rates. Despite using the full potential of continence-sparing techniques and atraumatic robot-assisted surgery, postprostatectomy incontinence still occurs in 5-20?% of cases. Recently published data showed a trend of improved early return to continence using anterior suspension or posterior reconstruction in robot-assisted prostatectomy. Postprostatectomy incontinence has a negative impact on quality of life and causes high costs of treatment. Therefore, further research in the amelioration of postoperative continence is mandatory.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522692","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.558699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.52828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Land improvement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_improvement"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
