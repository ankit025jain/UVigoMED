{"id":85520,"title":"Frequent attenders to the ED: patients who present with repeated asthma exacerbations.","abstract":"Asthma has been reported as one of the main causes of frequent attendance to the emergency department (ED), and many of those visits are potentially preventable. Understanding the characteristics of frequent attender (FA) patients with asthmatic exacerbations will help to identify factors associated with frequent attendance and improve case management. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of FA who present multiple times to the ED for asthma exacerbations.This study was a retrospective review of cases presented to Singapore General Hospital ED in 2010. Patients who attended the ED for 4 times or more with at least 1 visit attributable to asthma exacerbations in 2010 were included. They were then categorized as FA with multiple exacerbations (FAME) and those with fewer exacerbations.Of 105616 ED patients, 155 patients attending the ED in 2010 were identified as FA with asthma, and 26 (17%) of these patients were classified as FAME, resulting in 213 visits (45% of total visits). Compared with FA with fewer exacerbations group, FAME were more likely to be men (P = .002), unemployed (P < .000), bad debtors (P = .045), substance abusers (P = .022), previously known to medical social workers (P = .002), and were found to spend a longer amount of time in the ED (>6 hours) (P = .03).We found that a small number of FAME patients accumulated a large number of ED visits and spent a significantly longer time in the ED. This group tended to be males with social, financial, and addiction problems.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919775","annotations":[{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.506197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.504321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.329769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Singapore General Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_General_Hospital"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"FAA airport categories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA_airport_categories"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Debtor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"}]}
