{"id":32694,"title":"[Treatment strategy toward Fontan completion in hypoplastic left heart syndrome].","abstract":"The Norwood procedure with right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit is thought to improve post-operative hemodynamics in hypoplastic left heart syndrome( HLHS). Prematurity( GA<37 weeks), body weight less than 2.5 kg and tricuspid regurgitation( TR)2+ or more were associated with mortality. For requiring better outcome, paralyzed ventilation, inherent N2 are indicated, to avoid preoperative high pulmonary blood flow followed by progressive TR. Rapid staged bilateral pulmonary artery banding( PAB) might improve the outcome for this high mortality group. As operative improvement, the distal neoaortic reconstruction was completed without any patch materials in most case. For achievement this, it is important that aortic arch and ascending aorta just opposite the site of the innominate artery were sutured inferiorly to extend the width of the aortic arch. Also we have developed a modified strategy to control RV-PA shunt flow, which is partial clipping on the ePTFE graft. Because significant TR associated with mortality, TR should be surgically treated at any sage of reconstruction. At bidirectional Glenn operation, 70% of patient were left the RV-PA conduit as additional flow. Hospital mortality after Fontan completion for HLHS is excellent with short averaging more than 95%. Extracardiac conduit with fenestration is indicated in all HLHS patients.
