{"id":23147,"title":"[Modern diagnosis-treatment approaches for inflammatory changes of mammary glands].","abstract":"There were examined 567 women, in whom inflammatory changes of mammary glands (MG), not connected with a child borning, were revealed. There was established, that \"nonlactational mastitis\" of various structure: the cyst--in 36.5% of observations, periductal mastitis--in 32.1%, abscess--11.3%, purulent galactophoritis--12.9%, mastitis-like mammary gland cancer--7.2%. In the diagnosis of inflammatory changes of MG the ultrasonographic investigation is the main, which permit to determine the disease, to study the abscesses topography, to control miniinvasive diagnostic-treatment interventions, in cluding, for abscess and cyst. Purulent-inflammatory processes in MG while extralactational period demand individual differentiated treatment-diagnostic approach regarding khowledge of ultrasonographic (echographic) semiotics of pathological process.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501989","annotations":[{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.49236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"MG Cars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Process (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(anatomy)"}]}
