{"id":52778,"title":"Human ?-cell regeneration: progress, hurdles, and controversy.","abstract":"Therapies that increase functional ?-cell mass may be the best long-term treatment for diabetes. Significant resources are devoted toward this goal, and progress is occurring at a rapid pace. Here, we summarize recent advances relevant to human ?-cell regeneration.New ?-cells arise from proliferation of pre-existing ?-cells or transdifferentiation from other cell types. In addition, dedifferentiated ?-cells may populate islets in diabetes, possibly representing a pool of cells that could redifferentiate into functional ?-cells. Advances in finding strategies to drive ?-cell proliferation include new insight into proproliferative factors, both circulating and local, and elements intrinsic to the ?-cell, such as cell cycle machinery and regulation of gene expression through epigenetic modification and noncoding RNAs. Controversy continues in the arena of generation of ?-cells by transdifferentiation from exocrine, ductal, and alpha cells, with studies producing both supporting and opposing data. Progress has been made in redifferentiation of ?-cells that have lost expression of ?-cell markers.Although significant progress has been made, and promising avenues exist, more work is needed to achieve the goal of ?-cell regeneration as a treatment for diabetes.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569551","annotations":[{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.824471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.416493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.358193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.341444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.17834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Exocrine gland","weight":0.092158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Alpha decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Progress (spacecraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_(spacecraft)"},{"name":"Hurdling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdling"},{"name":"Arena","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena"},{"name":"Avenue (landscape)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_(landscape)"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"}]}
