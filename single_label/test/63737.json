{"id":63737,"title":"Faulty ECM signaling facilitates autoimmune lymphomagenesis.","abstract":"The contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the microenvironment of solid tumors is appreciated although not completely understood; however, the contribution of the ECM to the development of hematopoietic tumors has not been investigated in depth. A new study by Sangaletti and colleagues demonstrates that faulty ECM signaling can facilitate malignant lymphoproliferation in mice predisposed to autoimmunity. Similar changes in ECM construction, consistent with a loss of inhibitory ECM signaling, were identified in the transition from reactive lymphoid hyperplasia to malignant chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients. These results reveal a critical contribution of reduced collagen signaling in lymphoma and highlight the importance of appropriate ECM construction for maintenance of tissue homeostasis.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402944","annotations":[{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.848204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.730262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.725119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.681066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.543164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.460295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
