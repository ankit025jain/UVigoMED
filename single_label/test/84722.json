It is shown that the psycho-emotional impact is accompanied by a hypercoagulable. \"Clean\" effect of hypothermia is characterized by the activation of anticoagulation and fibrinolysis. Thus, we have shown that the general hypothermia in the aquatic environment has a more pronounced effect on the hemostatic system than the psycho-emotional impact.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051679","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.493301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.357647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.248789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Aquatic ecosystem","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Aquatic animal","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Clean (2004 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_(2004_film)"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
