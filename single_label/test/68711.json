{"id":68711,"title":"Protective effect of magnesium preloading on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity: a retrospective study.","abstract":"Magnesium supplementation has been reported to have a nephroprotective effect on cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction, but little evidence exists regarding the effect of magnesium preloading before cisplatin administration. We started to include magnesium preloading (8 mEq) in cisplatin-containing treatment regimens in January 2011. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether magnesium preloading reduces cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.We retrospectively reviewed 496 thoracic malignancy patients treated with cisplatin (?60 mg/mÂ²)-containing regimens as a first-time chemotherapy between January 2009 and December 2011. We compared the incidence of Grade ?2 serum creatinine elevation according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, between magnesium preloading group (n = 161 [32%]) and non-magnesium preloading group (n = 335 [68%]) during the first cycle and all cycles.The median number of administered cycles was four in both groups. The incidence of Grade ?2 serum creatinine elevation in magnesium preloading group was significantly lower during both the first cycle and all cycles than in the non-magnesium preloading group (4.9 versus 19.1% during the first cycle, and 14.2 versus 39.7% during all the cycles). A multivariate analysis indicated that magnesium preloading significantly reduced cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity throughout the entire period from after the first administration (odds ratio: 0.262, 95% confidence interval: 0.106-0.596 during the first cycle, and odds ratio: 0.234, 95% confidence interval: 0.129-0.414 during all cycles).Magnesium preloading before cisplatin administration significantly reduced cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital
