{"id":22392,"title":"Very low rates of culture-confirmed invasive bacterial infections in a prospective 3-year population-based surveillance in Southwest London.","abstract":"To estimate the incidence, clinical characteristics and risk factors for culture-confirmed invasive bacterial infections in England.Prospective, observational, study of all children with positive blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture over a 3-year period (2009-2011).All five hospitals within a geographically defined region in southwest London providing care for around 600?000 paediatric residents.Children aged 1?month to 15?yearsRates of community-acquired and hospital-acquired invasive bacterial infections in healthy children and those with co-morbidities; pathogens by age group, risk group and clinical presentation.During 2009-2011, 44?118 children had 46?039 admissions, equivalent to 26 admissions per 1000 children. Blood/CSF cultures were obtained during 44.7% of admissions, 7.4% were positive but only 504 were clinically significant, equivalent to 32.9% of positive blood/CSF cultures, 2.4% of all blood/CSF cultures and 1.1% of hospital admissions. The population incidence of culture-confirmed invasive bacterial infection was 28/100?000. One-third of infections were hospital acquired and, of the community-acquired infections, two-thirds occurred in children with pre-existing co-morbidities. In previously healthy children, therefore, the incidence of community-acquired invasive bacterial infection was only 6.4/100?000.Although infection was suspected in almost half the children admitted to hospital, a significant pathogen was cultured from blood or CSF in only 2.4%, mainly among children with pre-existing co-morbidities, who may require a more broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic regime compared to previously healthy children. Invasive bacterial infection in previously healthy children is now very rare. Improved strategies to manage low-risk febrile children are required.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24554055","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.893756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.608781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"England","weight":0.555396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.53907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.374558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"London","weight":0.328511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Southwestern United States","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"}]}
