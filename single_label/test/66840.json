{"id":66840,"title":"Herpes simplex virus inoculation in murine rete testis results in irreversible testicular damage.","abstract":"This study aimed to establish the influence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) on testis morphology and germ cell development using a model of ascending urogenital HSV infection in mice. Adult C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with 100 plaque-forming units of HSV1 in rete testis. Viral proteins and HSV DNA were detected from 3 days postinoculation (DPI), while capsids and virions could be visualized at 6 DPI. Infectious activity of HSV was revealed by rapid culture method in testes from 3 to 14 DPI, and virus DNA by PCR - from 3 to 100 DPI. Germ and Sertoli cells were infected during the early stages of the infection, whereas interstitial cells only occasionally contained the virus at 21 and 45 DPI. Microscopic analysis revealed severe degeneration of the germinal epithelium in the infected testes. By 21 DPI, testes became atrophic and most Sertoli cells were destroyed. No testicular regeneration and no spermatozoa in the epididymis were observed at 45 and 100 DPI. From 3 DPI, inflammatory cells accumulated in the interstitium between damaged tubules; a significant increase in the number of CD4(+), CD8(+) T lymphocytes and F4/80(+) cells was observed in the infected testes. This study shows that in the case of HSV retrograde ascent into seminiferous tubules, the acute viral infection results in irreversible atrophy of the germinal epithelium, orchitis and infertility. These results may be used to further study viral orchitis and the influence of HSV on spermatogenesis and male fertility.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital
