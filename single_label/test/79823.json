{"id":79823,"title":"[True and virtual risks of travellers].","abstract":"Evidence-based information on travel associated mortality is scarce. Perception, intuition and the availability of interventions such as vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis often guide pre-travel advice. Important risks including accidents and cardiovascular events are not routinely included in pre-travel consultations although they cause more fatalities and costs than infectious diseases. The increased risk of sustaining a road accident in poor economy countries should always be mentioned. The general practitioner is further best placed to discuss possible problems of travellers with chronic diseases before travel.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908743","annotations":[{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.905328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.619129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.587964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.512605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Chemoprophylaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Intuition (knowledge)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)"},{"name":"Panic of 1893","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}]}
