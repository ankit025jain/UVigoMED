{"id":73115,"title":"Metabolomic profiling of neoplastic lesions in mice.","abstract":"Most cancers develop upon the accumulation of genetic alterations that provoke and sustain the transformed phenotype. Several metabolomic approaches now allow for the global assessment of intermediate metabolites, generating profound insights into the metabolic rewiring associated with malignant transformation. The metabolomic profiling of neoplastic lesions growing in mice, irrespective of their origin, can provide invaluable information on the mechanisms underlying oncogenesis, tumor progression, and response to therapy. Moreover, the metabolomic profiling of tumors growing in mice may result in the identification of novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, which is of great clinical significance. Several methods can be applied to the metabolomic profiling of neoplastic lesions in mice, including mass spectrometry-based techniques (e.g., gas chromatography-, capillary electrophoresis-, or liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry) as well as nuclear magnetic resonance. Here, we compare and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of all these techniques to provide a concise and reliable guide for readers interested in this active area of investigation.
