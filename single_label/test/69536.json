{"id":69536,"title":"[Potentials for the correction of endothelial and erectile dysfunction in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting].","abstract":"The study was aimed to the evaluation the effect of NO- synthase inducer impaza on endothelial function and erectile function in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The study involved 127 men with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), aged 55.8 +/- 5.3 years, which were planned on CABG. The survey included assessment of IIEF score and blood lipid levels, registration of nocturnal penile tumescences, postcompression tests on the shoulder and cavernous arteries. Endothelial function was assessed as the plasma levels of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). The comparison group of patients (n = 67) were treated with standard rehabilitation program, and the study group (n = 67) additionally has received impaza 1 tablet a day for 24 weeks. It is shown that in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) undergoing CABG, the use of impaza for 24 weeks facilitates optimal dynamic expression of the ED. But a year after the operation, there were marked deterioration in erectile function, indicating a short-term effect of action of impaza that may require its longer use. In addition, 6 months after CABG, patients receiving impaza had better indicators of functional activity of the endothelium in shoulder and cavernous arteries compared with patients who received conventional rehabilitation; one year after surgery, however, there were no significant differences in these parameters. Restorative treatment using impaza in CAD patients after myocardial revascularization operations has positive influence on the NO, ET-1 levels, which is reflected in the functional state of the endothelium and characterized by an increase in vasodilator properties and decrease in vasoconstrictor properties.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital
