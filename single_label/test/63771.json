{"id":63771,"title":"An unexpected cause for aplastic anaemia in an elderly woman.","abstract":"Aplastic anaemia is a rare clinical syndrome associated with diminished or absent precursors in the bone marrow. Acquired aplastic anaemia secondary to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is very rare. We present a 71-year-old woman with severe aplastic anaemia secondary to HIV infection, which was after extensive exclusion of other causes. She achieved undetectable viral load after 5 months of combination antiretroviral therapy but remains profoundly pancytopenic, complicated by recurrent infectious and bleeding complications. HIV infection should be considered in patients with pancytopenia.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400346","annotations":[{"name":"Aplastic anemia","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia"},{"name":"Pancytopenia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancytopenia"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.476722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.236142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.235029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Acquired disorder","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_disorder"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"}]}
