{"id":80834,"title":"Three cases of cutaneous myiasis caused by Cordylobia rodhaini.","abstract":"Cordylobia sp. is a fly belonging to the Calliphoridae family. Three species of Cordylobia are known: C. anthropophaga, C. rodhaini and C. ruandae. The C. rodhaini Gedoelst 1909 lives in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rain forest areas. Usual hosts are rodents and antelopes. Humans are accidentally infested. Myiasis caused by C. rodhaini has been very rarely reported in the literature. We present three cases of C. rodhaini myiasis acquired in Ethiopia and Uganda.
