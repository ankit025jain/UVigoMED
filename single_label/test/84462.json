{"id":84462,"title":"[Complications after transplantation of a hepatic fragment from a living donor: the results of surgical interventions in 600 donors].","abstract":"Basing on retrospective analysis there were studied the rate and severity of complications (in accordance to T92-Dindo classification), ocurred after hepatic fragment resection in 600 living donors in period of 2007 - 2012 yrs. The donors were ageing from 18 to 65 yrs old, 31 yrs at average: there were 259 women and 341 men; body mass index (BMI) from 24 to 36 kg/m2, 27.4 kg/m2 at average; follow-up lasted from 2 to 58 mo, 39 mo at average. In 538 (89.6%) donors a right-sided hemihepatectomy was accomplished, in 19 (3.1%)--left-sided hemihepatectomy, in 43 (7.2%)--left lateral sectorectomy (C(II) - CIII segment). Residual hepatic volume in donors was from 26 to 87%, 37% at average; the operation duration was from 205 to 440 min, 327 min at average; intraoperative blood loss--from 105 to 800 ml, 310 ml at average; a stationary stay have constituted from 5 to 13 days, 7.2 days at average. In 116 (19.3%) donors 187 various complications have occurred, predominantly mild, they were eliminated using conservative treatment. Biliary complications (the bile outflow, biloma, stricture of biliary ducts) were revealed mostly often--in 64 (10.6%) patients. In 34 reoperations were performed. All donors are alive.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25097991","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.925728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.738783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.663118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.575714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.327706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.147116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"CIII-TV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIII-TV"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800"},{"name":"538","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/538"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"259","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/259"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/341"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Old Basing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Basing"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"T92 Light Tank","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T92_Light_Tank"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
