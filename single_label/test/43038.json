{"id":43038,"title":"Preventing intraperitoneal adhesions with linezolid and hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose: a comparative study in cecal abrasion model.","abstract":"We aimed to compare the effectiveness of linezolid in preventing intraperitoneal adhesions with hyaluronic acid + carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm).Thirty rats were divided randomly into 3 groups: Group I (control), untreated; Group II (Seprafilm); and Group III (linezolid). All rats were sacrificed on the 14th day after surgery. Macroscopic adhesion, inflammation, and fibrosis were evaluated.The multiple comparisons between groups showed a statistically significant difference for adhesion. There were statistically significant differences between Group I and II and I and III, but no statistically significant difference between Group II and III. The multiple comparisons between the groups showed a statistically significant difference for inflammation and fibrosis. For inflammation and fibrosis, there was a statistically significant difference between Group I and II and I and III, but no statistically significant difference between Group II and III.The efficiency of linezolid in reducing the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions was statistically significant compared with the control group.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814308","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.561941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.297391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Linezolid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linezolid"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Carboxymethyl cellulose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxymethyl_cellulose"},{"name":"Multiple comparisons","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"}]}
