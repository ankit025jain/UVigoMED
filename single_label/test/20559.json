{"id":20559,"title":"[Etiology and epidemiological characterization of non-malarial febrile syndrome in three municipalities of Urabá (Antioquia), Colombia].","abstract":"Urabá, a region on the northern coast of Colombia, is endemic to several acute febrile illnesses of infectious origin; however, only patients with malaria may have access to quick and effective diagnosis. For this reason, many non-malarial febrile patients go without a clear etiologic diagnosis.To establish the etiology and clinical signs of acute febrile non-malaria syndromes and explore some of the likely risk factors in patients originating in the municipalities of Necocli, Turbo and Apartado who exhibit these symptoms.We obtained acute and convalescent sera from 220 non-malarial febrile patients from the rural and urban zones of Necocli, Turbo and Apartado during 2007 and 2008. Serologic tests for dengue (IgM by ELISA), leptospirosis (IgM and IgG by IFA), rickettsiosis (IgG by IFI), hanta and arenavirus (IgG by ELISA) were performed.We found that the frequency of infection for dengue, leptospirosis, rickettsiosis and arenavirus, was 37.3%; 14.1%; 2.7% and 0.5%, respectively. There were 12 co-infection cases of leptospirosis-dengue and one of leptospirosis-rickettsiosis-dengue. Male gender and relative humidity were considered risk factors for dengue, and the beginning of clinical signs in February of 2008 was associated with the infection of dengue and leptospirosis.This study confirms previous records that underline the importance of Rickettsia spp, dengue virus and Leptospira spp as causal agents of febrile syndrome in this region of Colombia.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652254","annotations":[{"name":"Leptospirosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Rickettsia","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsia"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Arenavirus","weight":0.697176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arenavirus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.652876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.544156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.461139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Dengue virus","weight":0.460845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_virus"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Leptospira","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospira"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Convalescence","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convalescence"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Relative humidity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Humidity","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
