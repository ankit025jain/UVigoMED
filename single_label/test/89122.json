{"id":89122,"title":"Breast cancer after chest radiation therapy for childhood cancer.","abstract":"The risk of breast cancer is high in women treated for a childhood cancer with chest irradiation. We sought to examine variations in risk resulting from irradiation field and radiation dose.We evaluated cumulative breast cancer risk in 1,230 female childhood cancer survivors treated with chest irradiation who were participants in the CCSS (Childhood Cancer Survivor Study).Childhood cancer survivors treated with lower delivered doses of radiation (median, 14 Gy; range, 2 to 20 Gy) to a large volume (whole-lung field) had a high risk of breast cancer (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 43.6; 95% CI, 27.2 to 70.3), as did survivors treated with high doses of delivered radiation (median, 40 Gy) to the mantle field (SIR, 24.2; 95% CI, 20.7 to 28.3). The cumulative incidence of breast cancer by age 50 years was 30% (95% CI, 25 to 34), with a 35% incidence among Hodgkin lymphoma survivors (95% CI, 29 to 40). Breast cancer-specific mortality at 5 and 10 years was 12% (95% CI, 8 to 18) and 19% (95% CI, 13 to 25), respectively.Among women treated for childhood cancer with chest radiation therapy, those treated with whole-lung irradiation have a greater risk of breast cancer than previously recognized, demonstrating the importance of radiation volume. Importantly, mortality associated with breast cancer after childhood cancer is substantial.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752044","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.821376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.539504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.475238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.441444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.430843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.154115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Mantle (geology)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Ironman 70.3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3"}]}
