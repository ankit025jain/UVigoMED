{"id":47567,"title":"HMG-CoA reductase regulates CCL17-induced colon cancer cell migration via geranylgeranylation and RhoA activation.","abstract":"Simvastatin is widely used to lower cholesterol levels in patients with cardiovascular diseases, although accumulating evidence suggests that statins, such as simvastatin, also exert numerous anti-tumoral effects.The aim of this study was to examine the effect of simvastatin on colon cancer cell migration.Migration assays were performed to evaluate CCL17-induced colon cancer cell (HT-29) chemotaxis. In vitro tumor growth and apoptosis were assessed using a proliferation assay and annexin V assay, respectively. Active RhoA protein levels in CCL17-stimulated colon cancer cells were quantified using a G-LISA assay.We found that simvastatin dose-dependently decreased CCL17-induced colon cancer cell migration. Simvastatin had no effect on colon cancer cell proliferation or apoptosis. Inhibition of beta chemokine receptor 4, CCR4, reduced CCL17-evoked activation of RhoA in colon cancer cells. Moreover, administration of mevalonate reversed the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on CCL17-induced colon cancer cell migration. Interestingly, co-incubation with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) antagonized the inhibitory impact of simvastatin on colon cancer cell migration triggered by CCL17. Moreover, we observed that simvastatin decreased CCL17-induced activation of RhoA in colon cancer cells. Administration of mevalonate and GGPP reversed the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on CCL17-provoked RhoA activation in colon cancer cells.Taken together, our findings show for the first time that HMG-CoA reductase regulates CCL17-induced colon cancer cell migration via inhibition of geranylgeranylation and RhoA activation. Thus, statins, such as simvastatin, might be effective tools to antagonize CCL17-dependent migration and metastasis of colon cancer cells.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582560","annotations":[{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.761972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.651253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.624874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.620188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.588529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.581676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.496471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chemokine receptor","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine_receptor"},{"name":"RHOA","weight":0.2981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHOA"},{"name":"HMG-CoA reductase","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMG-CoA_reductase"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.257316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Pyrophosphate","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Simvastatin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simvastatin"},{"name":"Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geranylgeranyl_pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Annexin A5","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin_A5"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Mevalonic acid","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevalonic_acid"}]}
