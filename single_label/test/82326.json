{"id":82326,"title":"The botryoid cyst: case report.","abstract":"The clinical and radiographic features of the botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) are non-specific; and significant overlap exists with other lesions. Here we report a case of an asymptomatic BOC in the anterior mandible. The purpose of this report is to call attention to the manifestations of the BOC, to review the differential diagnosis and to outline the histologic criteria required to establish a definitive diagnosis. This report highlights the importance of careful histologic examination of unilocular or multilocular radiolucencies lying lateral to the roots of vital teeth. Following diagnosis of a BOC, long-term follow-up to monitor for recurrence is indicated.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654369","annotations":[{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.866901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.750305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.581995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.426206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.408031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.284057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Adjacent-channel interference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacent-channel_interference"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"The BOC Group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BOC_Group"},{"name":"Locule","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locule"},{"name":"Odontogenic cyst","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic_cyst"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
