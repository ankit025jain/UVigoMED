{"id":84089,"title":"[Effects of batroxobin on perioperative blood loss and coagulation in patients with low molecular weight heparin when undergoing the total hip replacement].","abstract":"To investigate the interactive effects between batroxobin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in reducing peri-operative blood loss and coagulation function in patients who undergone the total hip replacement surgery.240 ASA I - III patients received 4 000 IU LMWH 12 hours preoperatively before undergoing the total hip replacement operation, were randomly divided into two groups:testing group (Group A, n = 120) and control group (Group B, n = 120) receiving 2 U batroxobin or 50 mg mannitol 10 minutes before incision respectively. Perioperative blood loss, postoperative 24 hours drainage and blood routine test, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured respectively. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were measured through color Doppler B-ultrasound 3 days after the operation.The perioperative blood loss in Group A (422.64 ml) was less than that in Group B (667.67 ml) (P < 0.01) while red blood cell, hemoglobin, red blood cell volume and platelet were decreasing after operation in both groups but no significant difference was found between the two groups (P > 0.05). There were no drug-related adverse effects found in the two groups, neither the difference in hospitalization between the two groups (P > 0.05).Batroxobin (2 U) could reduce the perioperative blood loss in patients with LMWH who had undergone the total hip replacement operation but did not show adverse effect on DVT.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174484","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.916951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Mannitol","weight":0.891514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannitol"},{"name":"Low molecular weight heparin","weight":0.885779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_molecular_weight_heparin"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.872009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Partial thromboplastin time","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_thromboplastin_time"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.761359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.739545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.703733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.429621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Thromboplastin","weight":0.415896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboplastin"},{"name":"Batroxobin","weight":0.2981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batroxobin"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
