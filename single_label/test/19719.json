{"id":19719,"title":"Risk factors for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection/colonization: a case-case-control study.","abstract":"Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is increasingly reported worldwide. The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors associated with the development of CRKP infections. A retrospective, case-case-control study was performed at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece. The study population included 83 patients from whom CRKP was isolated, 79 from whom carbapenem-sensitive K. pneumoniae (CSKP) was isolated and 161 (control group) from whom K. pneumoniae was not isolated. The median age of CRKP and CSKP patients was 79 (28-101) and 80 (39-97) years, respectively, while that of the controls was 75 (18-100) years. K. pneumoniae was isolated predominantly from urine in both case groups, followed by blood. Independent risk factors for CRKP infection/colonization were admission to ICU (p = 0.004), prior surgical procedure (p = 0.036) and presence of renal disease (p = 0.037), while for CSKP were neurological disease (p = 0.007), and older age (p = 0.011). No association between CRKP and prior antimicrobial exposure was found. Of the entire cohort 40 patients (12%) died; 22 (27%) in the CRKP, 12 (15%) in the CSKP and 6 (4%) in the control group. Isolation of any K. pneumoniae strain was associated with higher mortality compared to the control group (21% vs. 4%; p < 0.005). Mortality was not statistically different between those infected/colonized/with a CRKP or a CSKP strain (p = 0.084). According to these results prior ICU stay, prior surgical procedure and renal disease were independent risk factors for the development of a CRKP infection/colonization.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703709","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.76877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.700994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.614434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.48362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Greece","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"The Independent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
