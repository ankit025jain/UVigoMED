{"id":28853,"title":"Mechanisms of epigenetic memory and addiction.","abstract":"Epigenetic regulation of cellular identity and function is at least partly achieved through changes in covalent modifications on DNA and histones. Much progress has been made in recent years to understand how these covalent modifications affect cell identity and function. Despite the advances, whether and how epigenetic factors contribute to memory formation is still poorly understood. In this review, we discuss recent progress in elucidating epigenetic mechanisms of learning and memory, primarily at the DNA level, and look ahead to discuss their potential implications in reward memory and development of drug addiction.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778453","annotations":[{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.62,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.497499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.309722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Covalent bond","weight":0.0625932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Encoding (memory)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_(memory)"},{"name":"Lookahead","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookahead"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Implications of nanotechnology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implications_of_nanotechnology"}]}
