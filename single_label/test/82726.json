{"id":82726,"title":"[Dissertations 25 years after date 38. Balance of masticatory muscles in relation to occlusion].","abstract":"It is well known that the dental occlusion can influence the activity of the masticatory muscles. However, a simple, reproducable and predictable relationship has not yet been found. Due to variability between different subjects, the use of absolute electromyographic values is unlikely to help dentists with the diagnostics of temporomandibular disfunction and the possible relationship with the occlusion. Possibly however, interest should center on intraindividual change in activity patterns, when we want to learn more about the effects of the dental occlusion in pathological situations. In recent years limited atttention has focused on the asymmetry ofjaw muscle activtiy and consequently little additional information on this aspect is presently available.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552069","annotations":[{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.649065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.544115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.366982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.119696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Thesis","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
