{"id":56623,"title":"Lower eyelid involutional entropion repair with lateral tarsal strip and infraciliary rotation sutures: surgical technique and outcomes.","abstract":"To describe a novel technique for the surgical repair of involution entropion of the lower eyelid and to evaluate its effectiveness in a series of patients.This retrospective interventional case series includes patients who underwent entropion repair via lateral tarsal strip with infraciliary rotation sutures during a 5-year period by one surgeon. Demographic data was collected and incidence of recurrence was determined.Forty-four eyelids of 36 patients with involutional entropion underwent surgical repair via lateral tarsal strip plus infraciliary rotation sutures. All patients had successful repair of entropion with no recurrences recorded on follow-up, which ranged from 1 to 67 months.Lateral tarsal strip combined with infraciliary rotation sutures is a successful method for the repair of involution entropion of the lower eyelid.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660998","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.328906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0321906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Involution (mathematics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Entropion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropion"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
