{"id":89799,"title":"Perfect--the enemy of good.","abstract":"Our article has limitations, which we thoroughly describe. However, as the article highlights, wheelchairs are requiring repairs much too often, the repairs are causing significant consequences for users, and the problem is getting worse. The commentary concludes that producing a strong study will be difficult and of limited value, but offers no call for better, larger studies or suggestions for improvements. We believe there is much to be learned from our data, and our conclusion is that we need to do better. We need more information, larger cohorts, and better methods. It is the best way to cause changes that will positively impact the millions of wheelchair users around the world.
