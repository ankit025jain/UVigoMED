{"id":89031,"title":"Endovascular treatment for nontraumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta: long-term results.","abstract":"This study evaluated the long-term results of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of nontraumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta.This was a retrospective and observational single-center study. During the 10-year study period, 21 patients (6 males) with an average age of 66.1?±?12.4 (range 31-81) years underwent emergency TEVAR for nontraumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta. The underlying aortic pathologies causing the rupture were degenerative aneurysms in 11 patients, complicated type B dissection in nine, and erosion hemorrhage due to neoplasia in one patient.The 30-day mortality rate was 9.5% (2/21). Two patients died postoperatively: one from a repeat aortic rupture and the other from pneumonia. Two patients underwent early endovascular reintervention. After a median follow-up of 65.6?±?50.4 (range 1.5-44) months, 10 patients died, resulting in a late mortality of 52.6% (10/19). Six patients (31.5%) developed major complications requiring late reintervention. There was no mortality with reintervention.Endovascular treatment of the descending thoracic aorta in patients with nontraumatic rupture is a promising treatment option in an emergency setting with a relatively low mortality rate. Despite encouraging early results, TEVAR is associated with a high reintervention rate and poor survival due to nonaortic or procedure-related mortality in the long term.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762036","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.631496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.630998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.32212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.303648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Traumatic aortic rupture","weight":0.070158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_aortic_rupture"},{"name":"Thoracic aorta","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_aorta"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"1019","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1019"},{"name":"650","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/650"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Trans-Neptunian object","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Descending aorta","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_aorta"}]}
