{"id":84265,"title":"Quality of life after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAP-BAND): APEX interim 3-year analysis.","abstract":"Obesity is often associated with diminished health-related quality of life (HRQOL), but significant gains in HRQOL have been observed after bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has been established as a safe, effective treatment to reduce weight in patients with obesity. This report summarizes interim 3-year changes in HRQOL and body weight, as well as safety postimplantation of the LAP-BAND AP (LBAP) system.The LAP-BAND AP EXperience (APEX) trial, an ongoing, prospective, 5-year, open-label study, assessed changes in HRQOL (Obesity and Weight-Loss Quality of Life [OWLQOL] questionnaire) and body weight, and safety after placement of LBAP. This interim analysis represents patients with evaluable OWLQOL data at baseline and at 3 years (n = 183).The OWLQOL total score and individual scores significantly improved within 6 months post-LBAP and continued to improve during a 3 year period (P < 0.0001, both). Total score improved from 71.0 to 34.0 (mean improvement from baseline, 52%; range, 18%-65%); mean change in individual scores was -2.2 (range, -0.7 to -3.0). Percent weight loss was maintained through 3 years (19.4%; n = 174). Improvement in OWLQOL was associated with percent weight loss at 3 years (r = -0.5407; P < 0.0001). Revisions and explants were performed in 7 (3.8%) and 20 (10.9%) out of 183 patients, respectively.Meaningful improvement in quality of life occurred through clinically significant weight loss after LBAP placement, extending throughout the 3 years of this analysis.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141251","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.689504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.398854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.372327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.308649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.222811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.128889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Adjustable gastric band","weight":0.113184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustable_gastric_band"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0695946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.0263423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1865","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1865"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Explant culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explant_culture"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Revisions (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisions_(album)"}]}
