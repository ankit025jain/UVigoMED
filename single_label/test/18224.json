{"id":18224,"title":"Concurrent meningococcal and herpes simplex infection in a non-immunocompromised child.","abstract":"A previously well 11-month-old infant presented with lethargy, a blanching rash, vomiting and diarrhoea. She was diagnosed with suspected gastroenteritis and discharged. The patient deteriorated and re-presented 24 h later with lumbar puncture (LP) confirming Neisseria meningitidis. Following an initial good response to ceftriaxone, the patient then developed a blistering facial rash on day 3 for which topical aciclovir was started with no improvement. She subsequently developed fever and redeveloped a rising C reactive protein (CRP). A CT of the head on day 6 was normal, however a repeat LP on day 7 showed persistently raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white cell count (WCC), high proteins and low CSF glucose. A CSF viral PCR confirmed concurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 for which parenteral aciclovir was started. The patient responded well to bacterial and viral anti-infective treatments and was subsequently discharged on day 16 with no neurological sequelae.
