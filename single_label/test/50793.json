{"id":50793,"title":"Use of fertility drugs and risk of ovarian cancer.","abstract":"The purpose of this review is to highlight recent research and insights into the relationship between fertility drug use and ovarian cancer risk.Results from two large case-control studies provided further evidence that fertility drug use does not significantly contribute to risk of ovarian cancer among the majority of women when adjusting for known confounding factors. However, questions regarding the effect on certain subgroups, including long-term fertility drug users, women who remain nulligravid after fertility treatment, women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and borderline ovarian tumours, still remain. In addition, it may currently just be too early to determine whether there is an association between fertility drug use and ovarian cancer risk given that many of the exposed women are only now beginning to reach the ovarian cancer age range.Whether use of fertility drugs increases the risk of ovarian cancer is an important question that requires further investigation, in particular given the large number of women utilizing fertility treatments. Fortunately, results from recent studies have been mainly reassuring. Large well designed studies with sufficient follow-up time are needed to further evaluate the effects of fertility treatments within subgroups defined by patient and tumour characteristics.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752005","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"BRCA2","weight":0.8314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA2"},{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.607362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.40127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.343488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.330791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.242677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Fertility medication","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_medication"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.116802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"BRCA mutation","weight":0.0588861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA_mutation"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
