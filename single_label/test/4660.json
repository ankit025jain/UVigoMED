{"id":4660,"title":"Pre-eruptive intra-coronal resorption: controversies and treatment options.","abstract":"Pre-eruptive intra-coronal resorption (PIER) is a defect located in the dentin of an unerupted tooth, just beneath the dentin-enamel junction, with a prevalence of 0.5-2% of the teeth. The depth of the lesion is variable and may also reach the pulp. In the past, these lesions were confused with caries, and were therefore called \"hidden\" or \"pre-eruptive caries\". These defects are usually detected incidentally in routine dental radiographs. It has been proven that in the pre-eruptive stage the lesions contain soft tissue and inflammatory cells. The present report describes the clinical management of a case of PEIR on a mandibular first permanent molar and discusses the alternatives for treatment.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571683","annotations":[{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.728037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.721555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.639817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Tooth eruption","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_eruption"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.199887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dental radiography","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_radiography"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Prince Edward Island Railway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island_Railway"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
