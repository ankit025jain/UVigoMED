{"id":85886,"title":"Randomized phase III trial of erlotinib versus docetaxel as second- or third-line therapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: Docetaxel and Erlotinib Lung Cancer Trial (DELTA).","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy of erlotinib versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -unselected patient population.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), response rate, safety, and analyses on EGFR wild-type tumors. Patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, previous treatment with one or two chemotherapy regimens, evaluable or measurable disease, and performance status of 0 to 2 were eligible.From August 2009 to July 2012, 150 and 151 patients were randomly assigned to erlotinib (150 mg daily) and docetaxel (60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks), respectively. EGFR wild-type NSCLC was present in 109 and 90 patients in the erlotinib and docetaxel groups, respectively. Median PFS for erlotinib versus docetaxel was 2.0 v 3.2 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.55; P = .09), and median OS was 14.8 v 12.2 months (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.22; P = .53), respectively. In a subset analysis of EGFR wild-type tumors, PFS for erlotinib versus docetaxel was 1.3 v 2.9 months (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.94; P = .01), and OS was 9.0 v 10.1 months (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.39; P = .91), respectively.Erlotinib failed to show an improvement in PFS or OS compared with docetaxel in an EGFR-unselected patient population.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841974","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Erlotinib","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlotinib"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.606934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.56182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.515082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.350523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.142337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
