{"id":83459,"title":"Addition of transversus abdominis plane block to patient controlled analgesia for laparoscopic high anterior resection improves analgesia, reduces opioid requirement and expedites recovery of bowel function.","abstract":"Opioid sparing in postoperative pain management appears key in colorectal enhanced recovery. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks offer such an effect. This study aimed to quantify this effect on pain, opioid use and recovery of bowel function after laparoscopic high anterior resection.This was a retrospective analysis of prospective data on 68 patients. Patients received an epidural (n=24), intravenous morphine patient controlled analgesia (PCA, n=22) or TAP blocks plus PCA (n=22) determined by anaesthetist preference. Outcome measures were numerical pain scores (0-3), cumulative intravenous morphine dose and time to recovery of bowel function (passage of flatus or stool).There were no differences in patient characteristics, complications or extraction site. The TAP block group had lower pain scores (0.7 vs 1.36, p<0.001) and morphine requirements (8 mg vs 15 mg, p=0.01) than the group receiving PCA alone at 12 hours and 24 hours. Earlier passage of flatus (2.0 vs 2.7 vs 3.4 days, p=0.002), stool (3.1 vs 4.1 vs 5.5 days, p=0.04) and earlier discharge (4 vs 5 vs 6 days, p=0.02) were also seen.Use of TAP blocks was found to reduce pain and morphine use compared with PCA, expedite recovery of bowel function compared with PCA and epidural, and expedite hospital discharge compared with epidural.","date":"2014-10-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350178","annotations":[{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Patient-controlled analgesia","weight":0.675864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-controlled_analgesia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Flatulence","weight":0.551008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.318787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.231451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Transversus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"Addition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Enhanced oil recovery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Census block group","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"}]}
