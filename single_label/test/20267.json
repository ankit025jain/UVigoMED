{"id":20267,"title":"Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels in patients with cutaneous anthrax: a laboratory analysis.","abstract":"Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), the main endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, is considered to be associated with endothelial dysfunction. High ADMA levels have been shown to be related with disorders causing vascular inflammation such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, chronic heart failure, stroke and sepsis. Cutaneous anthrax (CA) is a serious infectious disease which may cause vasculitis. The aim of the study was to investigate the serum ADMA levels in patients with CA.A total of 35 serum samples of the patients with CA and 18 control sera were tested for ADMA levels using ADMA ELISA kit (Immunodiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany).ADMA levels were found to be significantly higher in the patients group than the controls (p?<?0.001). In addition, ADMA levels were found to be positively associated with sedimentation rates (R?=?0.413; p?=?0.026), and inversely associated with international normalized ratio (INR) levels (R?=?-0.46; p?=?0.011). A cut-off value of 0.475 of ADMA had a sensitivity of 74.3%, specificity of 77.8%, and accuracy of 75.5% in the diagnosis of CA.Although the exact mechanism still remains unclear, ADMA levels could be related to immune activation in CA. In addition, these data might suggest the higher ADMA levels in patients could be due to the perivascular inflammation and vasculitis in CA.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
