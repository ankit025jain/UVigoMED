{"id":46560,"title":"Safety and performance of liver biopsies in liver transplant recipients.","abstract":"Liver biopsy in patients after liver transplantation (OLT) serves as a diagnostic tool to establish the cause of liver pathology. However, liver biopsy may cause life-threatening complications. Very limited information is available about complications and success rates of liver biopsies in patients after OLT. Our aim was to investigate biopsy-related complications and quality of specimen obtained by liver biopsy after OLT and to evaluate risks and benefits of this procedure.Retrospective analysis of patients after OLT presenting for liver biopsy between January 2000 and October 2012. All patients were observed for 24 h after intervention. Twelve or more portal tracts were required for liver biopsy specimens to be considered as adequate.Of 703 liver biopsies were performed in 409 patients. Thirteen (1.9%) liver biopsies did not have an adequate number of portal tracts. Only 10 (1.4%) liver biopsies caused complications. Five patients suffered from pain, three patients developed post-procedural fever, and three patients had subcapsular/intercostal bleeding. One patient suffered from a vasovagal reaction. Pain was treated by analgesics; none of the patients required blood transfusion or surgery.Liver biopsy is a safe and adequate diagnostic tool in patients after OLT.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628078","annotations":[{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.164292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Vasovagal response","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasovagal_response"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatic portal system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_system"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"}]}
