{"id":23478,"title":"NDM-1 Metallo-?-Lactamase and ArmA 16S rRNA methylase producing Providencia rettgeri clinical isolates in Nepal.","abstract":"Drug-resistant Providencia rettgeri producing metallo-?-lactamase and 16S rRNA methylase has been reported in several countries. We analyzed P. rettgeri clinical isolates with resistance to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in a hospital in Nepal.Five clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant P. rettgeri were obtained in a hospital in Nepal. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the microdilution method and entire genomes were sequenced to determine drug-resistant genes. Epidemiological analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.Four of the 5 isolates were resistant to carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), with MICs ?16 mg/L, with the remaining isolate showing intermediate resistance to imipenem, with an MIC of 2 mg/L and susceptibility to meropenem with an MIC ?1 mg/L. All 5 isolates had blaVEB-1. Of the 4 carbapenem-resistant strains, 3 had blaNDM-1 and 1 had blaOXA-72. All isolates were highly resistant to aminoglycosides (MICs ?1,024 mg/L) and harbored armA. As the result of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern analysis in the 5 P. rettgeri isolates, 4 had identical PFGE patterns and the fifth showed 95.7% similarity.This is the first report describing multidrug-resistant P. rettgeri strains harboring blaNDM-1 or blaOXA-72 and armA isolated from patients in Nepal.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484534","annotations":[{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.755011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Aminoglycoside","weight":0.717758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.541668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.539839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.529057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.366522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.334066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.28729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.245291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.240812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Methylase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylase"},{"name":"List of hospitals in Nepal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hospitals_in_Nepal"},{"name":"Nepal","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Pattern recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Ibanez Talman","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez_Talman"}]}
