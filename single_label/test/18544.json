{"id":18544,"title":"Clinical and economic consequences of post-operative infections following major elective surgery in U.S. hospitals.","abstract":"The incidence and consequences of post-operative infections in patients undergoing major elective surgery is not well understood.Using a large U.S. healthcare claims database, we identified all patients who underwent major elective surgery between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2009. For each such patient, date of the first-noted surgery during this period was designated as the index date. Patients who developed infections within 30 d of their index date were matched to those who did not using propensity score matching. We compared hospital readmissions, mortality, and total healthcare cost during the 30-d period following index date between patients who developed post-operative infections versus those who did not.A total of 327,618 patients met all selection criteria. At 30 d following major elective surgery, 10.9% of patients had evidence of post-operative infections, 39% of which occurred during the index admission. In propensity-matched analyses, patients with post-operative infections were about five times as likely to be readmitted to hospital (11.3% vs. 2.1%) and more than twice as likely to die (0.8% vs. 0.3%) in the 30-d period following surgery; their average total healthcare cost was $8,417 higher ($29,229 vs. $20,812) (all comparisons, p<0.01).Approximately one in 10 patients undergoing major elective surgery develop post-operative infections by day 30. Post-operative infections are associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes and higher total healthcare cost.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786660","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.403612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Propensity score matching","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"812","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/812"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"618","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/618"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Health care in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
