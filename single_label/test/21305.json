{"id":21305,"title":"[Diagnostic and predictive capabilities of the quantification of C-reactive protein in patients with community-acquired pneumonia].","abstract":"According to numerous researches the authors emphasize the importance of the quantification of C-reactive protein in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. We gave an analysis of different publications on the given issue. We came to conclusion that available laboratory kits for the quantification of C-reactive protein in blood serum, including instant diagnosis, allow considering the given method as a method of common use for military-medical facilities.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611307","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.744256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.496338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.475244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.144092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"}]}
