{"id":83576,"title":"Fat mass index and hip bone mineral density in a group of Lebanese adolescents and young adults.","abstract":"The main aim of this study was to explore the relationship between fat mass index and hip bone mineral density in a group of Lebanese adolescents and young adults.91 females and 111 males (aged 13 to 30) participated in this study. Body composition (lean mass, fat mass and bone mineral content) and bone mineral density (BMD) of whole body (WB), total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN) were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Weight and height were measured, and body mass index (BMI), lean mass index (LMI) and fat mass index (FMI) were calculated. Body weight, BMI, lean mass and LMI were positively correlated to TH BMD and FN BMD in females and males. Fat mass and FMI were positively correlated to TH BMD and FN BMD in females but not in males.This study suggests that FMI is a positive determinant of TH BMD and FN BMD in adolescent girls and young women but not in adolescent boys and young men while LMI is a positive determinant of TH BMD and FN BMD in both genders.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306793","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry","weight":0.7643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.753561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.729316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.700132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.647946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.56029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.496025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.485448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Hip bone","weight":0.389764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_bone"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.236355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.204777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Lebanon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Hard water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water"},{"name":"Finnish Meteorological Institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Meteorological_Institute"},{"name":"The WB Television Network","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB_Television_Network"},{"name":"Military use of children","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Lisp Machines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machines"}]}
