{"id":447,"title":"Escherichia coli ST131 causing invasive infections in Romanian patients--a threat we can no longer ignore.","abstract":"Escherichia coli sequence type ST131 is a major pandemic clonal group of drug-resistant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) involved in community-onset and healthcare-associated infections. Thus far, its presence in our area has been paid little attention. This is a preliminary study intended to detect ST131 among 87 clinical isolates retrieved from a larger and unpublished E. coli collection. The study isolates originated from various specimens associated with invasive infections (blood, deep surgical wounds/abscesses, tracheal aspirates, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and peritoneal fluid) and were collected between 2010 and 2014. Based on the main inclusion criteria, resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) and/or fluoroquinolones (FQs), the isolates were distributed in three categories: isolates with resistance to FQs (20 isolates), to ESCs (8 isolates), and to FQs and ESCs (59 isolates), respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assays were performed to determine the major phylogenetic groups, to predict the MLST ST131 status, and to detect the bla(CTX-M) content of the ESC-resistant isolates. Overall, the studied isolates derived from phylogenetic groups B2 (42 isolates), A (30 isolates), B1 (11 isolates), and D (4 isolates). Thirty-five isolates, originating from blood (26 isolates), deep wounds (6 isolates), tracheal aspirates (2 isolates), and cerebrospinal fluid (1 isolate), were identified as members of O25b:H4 ST131. Most of them displayed resistance to both ESCs and FQs and harboured group 1 bla(CRX-M) genes. The emergence of ST131 in our region can no longer be ignored. Focused attention to this lineage could reduce infection-related morbidity and antibiotic resistance.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518564","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.858521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.803179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.719641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.669567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.507243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.482184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.442358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.412392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.37494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.3243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.223929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.223431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.182562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
