{"id":15768,"title":"Yersiniosis in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to assess the epidemiology of yersiniosis in Poland in 2012 compared to previous years.We reviewed surveillance data published in the annual bulletin \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland\" from 2007 to 2012 (MP Czarkowski et al., NIH and GIS) and individual yersiniosis case reports from 2012 sent by the Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations. Additionally, we used data from the Department of Demographic Surveys in Central Statistical Office.In Poland in 2012 a total of 231 yersiniosis cases were reported including 201 cases of intestinal and 30 cases of extraintestinal yersiniosis; 61.9% of patients were hospitalized. The incidence rate was 0.6 per 100 000 inhabitants. No deaths related to the disease were reported. Intestinal yersiniosis was manifested mostly by following symptoms: diarrhoea (87%), fever (76%), abdominal pain (47%) and vomiting (31%). The most affected group in intestinal infections were children younger than 4 years - 145 cases (72% of all cases). Extraintestinal form of infection was more common than in 2011 (19 cases) and usually involved symptoms from the osteoarticular system, noted in 90% of patients. Similarly to the previous year (2011) most cases of yersiniosis were reported from Mazowieckie province (103), no case has been reported from ?wi?tokrzyskie province. Serological types of Yersinia enterocolitica were identified in 120 cases (52%): serotype O3 (96.7%), O8 (2.5%) and O9 (<1%). There were two household outbreaks. In comparison to previous years the total number of cases caused by serotype O8 has significantly decreased - from 55 cases in 2011 to 3 cases in 2012.A large percentage (48%) of unknown Yersinia serotypes is a consequence, that physicians do not always request serotyping in routine diagnostics. Reporting cases of extraintestinal yersiniosis from only few provinces may suggest that the real number of infections remains underreported.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135506","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.746831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Yersinia enterocolitica","weight":0.67093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_enterocolitica"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.661133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Yersinia","weight":0.305841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.300165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.183484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Geographic information system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"},{"name":"Human skeleton","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skeleton"},{"name":"Yersiniosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersiniosis"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"}]}
