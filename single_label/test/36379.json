{"id":36379,"title":"Impact of velaglucerase alfa on bone marrow burden score in adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease: 7-year follow-up.","abstract":"Bone marrow infiltration by substrate-engorged \"Gaucher\" cells manifests early in Gaucher disease (GD). The impact of velaglucerase alfa on bone marrow burden (BMB) was evaluated as an exploratory assessment.BMB scores were assessed using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the lumbar spine (LS) and femora among symptomatic GD patients who participated in the 9-month Phase I/II trial and long-term extension study for velaglucerase alfa. A post-hoc assessment of marrow involvement was performed. BMB scores per site are 0-8 (0/1=normal; 8=severe infiltration).The median LS-BMB score at baseline was 6 (n=12; range 3-8); at 9 months, compared with baseline, there was a median change of -2 (n=11; two-sided p-value=0.0078). LS-BMB scores continued to decrease through 5 years (n=8; median change from baseline -5 [p=0.0078], median score 1 [range 1-4]) and were subsequently sustained through 7 years (n=8). LS-BMB decreases of ?2 points occurred in 6/11 patients at 9 months, and in all assessable patients (8/8) by 5 years. Long-term femoral BMB (F-BMB) assessment was possible for three patients; all experienced reductions of ?2 points at 5 years with a total score (LS-BMB+F-BMB) decrease ?4.This post hoc analysis suggests improvement in BMB scores through 5 years that was sustained through 7 years, despite dose reduction from 15 months. Prospective studies in a large cohort are needed to validate these findings.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581483","annotations":[{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.844007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.74922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.748048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Gaucher's disease","weight":0.405556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucher's_disease"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.354898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Velaglucerase alfa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velaglucerase_alfa"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Post hoc ergo propter hoc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Relaxation (NMR)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)"},{"name":"Guangdong","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
