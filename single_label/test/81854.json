{"id":81854,"title":"Simple \"TRS\" Auxiliary tube for retraction of anterior segment using segmental T loop mechanics.","abstract":"Segmental T loop is the most popular frictionless mechanics so far. This biomechanically sound system was designed for the Burstone's canine bracket, which can be extra inventory for the clinicians who want to practice the segmental T loop routinely. The present manuscript provides the alternate to Burstones canine bracket for the retraction of the anterior segment.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812739","annotations":[{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"Public address","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Line segment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Bracket","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Circular segment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_segment"}]}
