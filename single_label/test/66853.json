{"id":66853,"title":"Spontaneous hymeneal endometriosis: a rare cause of dyspareunia.","abstract":"Vulvar endometriosis can occur after surgery or trauma and cause dyspareunia. A 30-year-old woman presented with orificial dyspareunia lasting for 5 months. Her history was marked by a vaginal birth without perineal injury and the removal of a cyst from the left Bartholin's gland. On examination, we observed a selectively painful, superficial and retractile lesion, 5 mm in diameter at the junction of the hymen at some distance from the bartholinitis scar. Endometriosis was suspected due to the exacerbation of pain during menses. The surgery consisted of excision of the hymenal area of the painful lesion. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of endometrial tissue. The painful symptoms resolved and no additional treatment was administered. Any vulvar lesion, regardless of its appearance and location, can be related to endometriosis. Surgical resection is recommended to relieve the symptoms and provide histological proof.
