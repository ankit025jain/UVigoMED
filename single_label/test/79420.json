{"id":79420,"title":"[The application of laser beam welding of biological tissues for the purpose of ossiculoplasty].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to estimate the functional outcome of ossiculoplasty in the patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media and treated by means of laser beam welding of biological tissues. In order to obtain a good functional result of tympanoplasty including ossiculoplasty, it is necessary to conserve the elements of the sound-conducting system in the positions to which they were set during surgery. We reached this goal by fixing individual elements of the chain of the auditory ossicles by means of the laser beam welding of biological tissues with the use of platelet-rich plasma as a solder alloy. The audiometric examination of the patients within 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery showed that this technique improves the functional outcome of the treatment of the patients with chronic suppurative otitis media using prostheses for the substitution of the auditory ossicles.
