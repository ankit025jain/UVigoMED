{"id":55993,"title":"Identification of a novel MYOC mutation, p.(Trp373), in a family with open angle glaucoma.","abstract":"MYOC gene variants are associated with autosomal dominant primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). In this study, we describe a previously unreported MYOC variant segregating with a POAG phenotype in an Australian family. Two individuals affected with POAG and three unaffected individuals from the same family were recruited through the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma (ANZRAG). Direct sequencing of all MYOC coding exons identified the novel heterozygous single nucleotide transition MYOC:c.1119G>A, p.(Trp373), predicted to encode an aberrant truncated MYOC protein in two affected siblings. Two unaffected siblings and an unaffected niece were negative for the MYOC sequence variant.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768183","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.819649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.762575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.561411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"MYOC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MYOC"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"1119","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1119"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"List of Presidents of Rhodesia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Rhodesia"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Truncation (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry)"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Nephew and niece","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephew_and_niece"}]}
