{"id":92058,"title":"Effect of vitamin D in fracture healing in a child: case report.","abstract":"In this report, we describe the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on fracture healing in a young boy with a hypovitaminosis D who had a radius refracture. The radiographic evaluation of the callus formation shows a clear effect of vitamin D on fracture healing in absence of additional variables.Fracture healing restores the tissue to its original physical and mechanical properties and it involves a complex multistep process that involves response to injury, intramembranous bone formation, chondrogenesis, endochondral bone formation, and bone remodeling. All this process is influenced by a variety of systemic and local factors. It is generally assumed that vitamin D plays an intimate role in healing fractures; however, very little data exists on how it does.In this report, the authors describe the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on fracture healing in a young boy with a hypovitaminosis D who had a radius refracture.Our case report suggests that the hypovitaminosis D is a possible cause of inadequate fracture healing and refracture in children and it shows a clear effect of vitamin D supplementation on callus formation in the absence of additional variables.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452512","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.765108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.60058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.564792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Intramembranous ossification","weight":0.472164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramembranous_ossification"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.471167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Radius (bone)","weight":0.468039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Endochondral ossification","weight":0.319028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endochondral_ossification"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Chondrogenesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrogenesis"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
