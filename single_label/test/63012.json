{"id":63012,"title":"Driving CAR-based T-cell therapy to success.","abstract":"T cells that have been genetically modified, activated, and propagated ex vivo can be infused to control tumor progression in patients who are refractory to conventional treatments. Early-phase clinical trials demonstrate that the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) CD19 can be therapeutically engaged through the enforced expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) on clinical-grade T cells. Advances in vector design, the architecture of the CAR molecule especially as associated with T-cell co-stimulatory pathways, and understanding of the tumor microenvironment, play significant roles in the successful treatment of medically fragile patients. However, some recipients of CAR(+) T cells demonstrate incomplete responses. Understanding the potential for treatment failure provides a pathway to improve the potency of adoptive transfer of CAR(+) T cells. High throughput single-cell analyses to understand the complexity of the inoculum coupled with animal models may provide insight into the therapeutic potential of genetically modified T cells. This review focuses on recent advances regarding the human application of CD19-specific CAR(+) T cells and explores how their success for hematologic cancers can provide a framework for investigational treatment of solid tumor malignancies.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488441","annotations":[{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.862792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.78456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.563468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.458217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.350172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.106718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Plant propagation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
