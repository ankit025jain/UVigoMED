{"id":84065,"title":"Assessment of the genotoxicity of propineb in mice bone marrow cells using micronucleus assay.","abstract":"Propineb, a dithiocarbamate fungicide, is commonly used for the control of disease in a wide range of crops in agriculture. The genotoxic effects of commercial formulation of propineb in bone marrow cells of mice was investigated in vivo by micronucleus (MN) assay. The three different concentrations of propineb (12.5, 25 and 50 microg/ml; 0.01 ml per gram) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to mice for 24 and 48 h. The results of the MN assay indicated that propineb induced a significant increase in frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) at 25 and 50 microg/ml concentrations for 24 h and at the highest (50 microg/ml) concentration for 48 h when compared with negative control. Also significant reduction for the polychromatic erythrocyte/normochromatic erythrocyte (PCE/NCE) ratio which is indicative for bone marrow cytotoxicity was observed at the same concentrations for 24 and 48 h. These results lead us to the conclusion that propineb may have genotoxic and cytotoxic potential due to induction in the frequency of MN and a reduction in PCE/NCE ratio in the bone marrow cells of mice.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181854","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Fungicide","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungicide"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.777657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.666775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.607482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.5807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.549701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.258011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Genotoxicity","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotoxicity"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Micronucleus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus"},{"name":"Dithiocarbamate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithiocarbamate"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Polychromatic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychromatic"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
