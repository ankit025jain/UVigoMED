{"id":21401,"title":"[Pressure ulcer and tetanus in an elderly person].","abstract":"Clostridium tetani, the bacterium causing tetanus, can be found both in the soil and intestinal normal flora. While the majority of the Finnish population has adequate vaccination protection, part of the population exhibits weakened protection. We describe a case in which a patient developed tetanus as a consequence of pressure ulcer. The symptoms extended to the respiratory muscle region, resulting in respiratory insufficiency and cardiac arrest for the patient. The patient, however, recovered after successful resuscitation and extended intensive care as required by tetanus.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605433","annotations":[{"name":"Tetanus","weight":0.902837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.802769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.753081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.631202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.458324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Soil","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Clostridium tetani","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_tetani"},{"name":"Human microbiome","weight":0.110864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"}]}
