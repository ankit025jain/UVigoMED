{"id":66044,"title":"Age-related differences in kidney injury biomarkers induced by cisplatin.","abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in a half of cisplatin (CDDP)-treated patients. Traditional biomarkers including blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) are still used for detection of CDDP-induced AKI, but these biomarkers are not specific or sensitive. The aim of this study was to identify the specific and sensitive biomarkers against CDDP-induced renal injury between young (3-week-old) and old (20-week-old) rats. All animals were intraperitoneally injected once with CDDP (6 mg/kg). After 3 days, all animals were sacrificed and serum, urine, and kidney tissues were collected. Urinary and serum biomarkers as well as histological changes were measured. CDDP-induced proximal tubular damage was apparent from histopathological examination, being more severe in 3-week-old rats accompanied by increased number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. This was associated with elevated urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), glutathione-S-transferase alpha (GST-?), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1). In contrast, the levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and osteopontin were significantly increased in 20-week-old rats after CDDP treatment. These results indicate that the use of age-specific urinary biomarkers is necessary to diagnosis of CDDP-induced AKI. Especially, urinary KIM-1, GST-?, TIMP-1, and VEGF levels may help in the early diagnosis of young patients with CDDP-induced AKI.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751685","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Osteopontin","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopontin"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.759912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.738704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.651911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.623486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.404565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.339322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.308977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.283118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0384911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"}]}
