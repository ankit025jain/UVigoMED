{"id":3686,"title":"[Problems of and solutions of the Japanese general rules of cancer handling].","abstract":"More than 27 series of the Japanese general rules of cancer handling, which comprise the basic foundations of cancer diagnosis and treatment, are currently used for routine clinical management in Japan. However, important concerns such as compatibility with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, the lack of unity of revised time, and unsuitable term definitions during consensus have emerged following medical globalization, advances in medical treatment, and legislation regarding cancer registration in hospital, which will begin 2015. To efficiently employ the strong points of the Japanese general rules of cancer handling and conquer the problems associated with cancer treatment globalization in Japan, immediate unification of the current Japanese general rules of cancer handling is thought to be required. In this paper, I would like to propose a method for solving these problems henceforth by clarifying the problems associated with the Japanese general rules of cancer handling and establishing future relationships between the Japanese general rules of cancer handling and the UICC-TNM and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).
