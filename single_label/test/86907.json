{"id":86907,"title":"CD8+ T cells prevent antigen-induced antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue disease in mice.","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) causes pathologies ranging from the febrile illness dengue fever to the potentially lethal severe dengue disease. A major risk factor for developing severe dengue disease is the presence of subprotective DENV-reactive Abs from a previous infection (or from an immune mother), which can induce Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE). However, infection in the presence of subprotective anti-DENV Abs does not always result in severe disease, suggesting that other factors influence disease severity. In this study we investigated how CD8(+) T cell responses influence the outcome of Ab-mediated severe dengue disease. Mice were primed with aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted UV-inactivated DENV prior to challenge with DENV. Priming failed to induce robust CD8(+) T cell responses, and it induced nonneutralizing Ab responses that increased disease severity upon infection. Transfer of exogenous DENV-activated CD8(+) T cells into primed mice prior to infection prevented Ab-dependent enhancement and dramatically reduced viral load. Our results suggest that in the presence of subprotective anti-DENV Abs, efficient CD8(+) T cell responses reduce the risk of Ab-mediated severe dengue disease.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217165","annotations":[{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Dengue virus","weight":0.86913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_virus"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.824397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.62031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.588728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.30994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Denver Gold","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Gold"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"ADE classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_classification"},{"name":"Match fixing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing"},{"name":"Abz Love","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abz_Love"},{"name":"Primer (paint)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(paint)"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"A major","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_major"},{"name":"Priming (psychology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)"}]}
