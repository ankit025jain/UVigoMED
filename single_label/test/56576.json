{"id":56576,"title":"The role of reactive oxygen species in ocular malignancy.","abstract":"Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an attribute of malignant cells and is linked to the development of many of the characteristics considered \"hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, Cell 144(5), 2011, 646-674).\" Among these are sustained proliferative signaling, induction of new vascular growth, promotion of invasion, and metastatic potential. Maintaining the balance between the beneficial biological functions of ROS and the dysregulation seen in human disease such as cancer, presents a daunting conundrum in the future of oncology research. ROS involvement is pervasive throughout the process of tumorigenesis and subsequent cancer growth, yet the response to both pro- and antioxidant based therapy is varied. We will review the ROS species in the pathogenesis of primary ocular malignancy with consideration of potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
