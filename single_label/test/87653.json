{"id":87653,"title":"Comparison of our self-designed rotary self-locking intramedullary nail and interlocking intramedullary nail in the treatment of long bone fractures.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effects of our self-designed rotary self-locking intramedullary nail (RSIN) and interlocking intramedullary nail (IIN) for long bone fractures.A retrospective study was performed in 1,704 patients who suffered bone fractures and underwent RSIN or IIN operation in our hospital between March 1999 and March 2013, including 494 with femoral fractures, 572 with humeral fractures, and 638 with tibial fractures. Among them, 634 patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, healing rate, and the excellent and good rate of functional recovery were compared between two groups.Compared with IIN group, RSIN group exhibited significantly shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss no matter for humeral, femoral, or tibial fractures (all p?<?0.001). The healing rate in patients with more than 1 year follow-up was significantly higher in RSIN group for femoral and tibial fractures (both p?<?0.05). In RSIN group, no nail breakage or loosening occurred, but radial nerve injury and incision infection were respectively observed in one patient with humeral fracture. In IIN group, nail breakage or loosening occurred in 7 patients with femoral fractures and 16 patients with tibial fractures, radial nerve injury was observed in 8 patients with humeral fractures, and incision infection was present in 2 patients with humeral fractures and 1 patient with femoral fracture. The complication rate of IIN group was significantly higher than that of RSIN group (p?<?0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the excellent and good rate of shoulder, elbow, knee, and ankle joint functional recovery between RSIN group and IIN group.RSIN may be a reliable and practical alternative method for the treatment of long bone fractures.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25047454","annotations":[{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.710022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.690594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.655795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.621983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Femoral fracture","weight":0.358791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_fracture"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.229839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
