{"id":30088,"title":"Racial/ethnic variations in the influence of parental attachment on adolescent substance abuse.","abstract":"This article examines whether the influence of parental attachment on adolescent substance abuse differs by race/ethnicity. We hypothesized that the effect of parental attachment would be stronger for Asian Americans than for other adolescents. Using data from the 2005 Fairfax County Communities That Care survey (N = 7,589), we found no support for our hypothesis. Results suggest that the effect of parental attachment on self-reported substance abuse differs dramatically by the race/ethnicity of the adolescent. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564558","annotations":[{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.589917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.397256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.136268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0894997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Asian American","weight":0.0448853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_American"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Fairfax County, Virginia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_County,_Virginia"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"589","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/589"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"}]}
