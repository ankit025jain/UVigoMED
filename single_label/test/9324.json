{"id":9324,"title":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: how do mutations lead to disease?","abstract":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common monogenic genetic cardiac disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1:500 in the general population. Clinically, HCM is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricle (LV) walls, especially the septum, usually asymmetric, in the absence of any cardiac or systemic disease that leads to a secondary hypertrophy. The clinical course of the disease has a large inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity, ranging from mild symptoms of heart failure late in life to the onset of sudden cardiac death at a young age and is caused by a mutation in one of the genes that encode a protein from the sarcomere, Z-disc or intracellular calcium modulators. Although many genes and mutations are already known to cause HCM, the molecular pathways that lead to the phenotype are still unclear. This review focus on the molecular mechanisms of HCM, the pathways from mutation to clinical phenotype and how the disease's genotype correlates with phenotype.
