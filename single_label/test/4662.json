{"id":4662,"title":"Does casein phosphopeptid amorphous calcium phosphate provide remineralization on white spot lesions and inhibition of Streptococcus mutans?","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the remineralization effect of Casein Phosphopeptid Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (CPP-ACP) on white spot lesions (WSL) and its inhibitory effect on Streptococcus mutans colonization.The study group consisted of 60 children exhibiting at least 1-WSL. Subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups: a test group of using CPP-ACP cream (Tooth Mousse, GC Europe N.V., Leuven, Belgium) and a control group using only fluoride containing toothpaste for a period of 3-months. Baseline WSLs were scored using DIAGNOdent device (KaVo Germany) and the saliva samples were collected to measure S. mutans counts. After the 3-month period the WSLs were again recorded and the saliva sample collection was repeated. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was used for statistical analysis.DIAGNOdent measurements were increased by time (p = 0.002) in control group and no statistically significant diference (p = 0.217) was found in test group by the 3-month period. In both groups, the mutans counts were decreased in 3-month experimental period.These clinical and laboratory results suggested that CPP-ACP containing cream had a slight remineralization effect on the WSL in the 3-month evaluation period however longer observation is recommended to confirm whether the greater change in WSLs is maintained.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571679","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Casein","weight":0.777392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.744301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.504766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Amorphous solid","weight":0.499342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.346053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.223596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Recaldent","weight":0.144746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recaldent"},{"name":"Amorphous calcium phosphate","weight":0.131078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Remineralisation of teeth","weight":0.0541667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation_of_teeth"},{"name":"Leuven","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuven"},{"name":"Streptococcus mutans","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0230932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"}]}
