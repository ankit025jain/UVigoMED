It was shown that the largest amounts of bancol were accumulated in the stomach contents, heart, and spleen.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432426","annotations":[{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.820264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.510417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.487259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.276893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.118306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Equivalent dose","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_dose"},{"name":"Endotherm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotherm"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
