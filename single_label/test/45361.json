{"id":45361,"title":"Use of fluorescence imaging technology to identify peritoneal endometriosis: a case report of new technology.","abstract":"Indocyanine green has long been used to determine the vascularity of various anatomic structures. Endometriosis is a disease that features neovascularization as a part of its pathologic process. Presented is a case of detecting endometriosis with indocyanine green using the fluorescence imaging technology built into the daVinci Si surgical platform.
