{"id":7057,"title":"Can Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection be eradicated by mass vaccination?","abstract":"The feasibility to eradicate Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in a conventional PCV2 infected farm by vaccinating both sows and piglets using a commercially subunit vaccine was assessed. Vaccination strategy implied that all sows, boars and gilts of the farm were vaccinated every four months, and all piglets vaccinated and revaccinated with the same vaccine at 4 and 7 weeks of age, respectively. This vaccination strategy was applied during 12 consecutive months. Blood samples from 15 piglets of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of age and 15 sows were taken monthly PRE, DURING and POST mass vaccination strategy. From all the collected sera (n=1796), a representative proportion of them (n=1235, 69%) were analysed (n=1121 from piglets and n=114 from sows). All these samples were tested by PCV2 ELISA and PCV2 PCR (and quantitative-PCR when PCR positive). All tested sows were negative by PCR but seropositive. ELISA mean OD values of sows decreased throughout the study. Percentages of PCV2 PCR positive samples in piglets were 8% (12/150), 0.9% (6/659) and 3.5% (11/312) PRE, DURING and POST application of the mass vaccination program, respectively. ELISA mean OD values of PCV2 seropositive animals progressively decreased until the end of the mass vaccination period, but a clear seroconversion was observed after stopping such strategy. In conclusion, one year period of mass PCV2 vaccination (without implementing further farm management practices or biosafety measures) was not able to clear out PCV2 infection, and the virus became detectable again when vaccination was stopped.
