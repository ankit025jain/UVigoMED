{"id":91127,"title":"[Value of preventive tracheotomy in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury].","abstract":"To evaluate the value of preventive tracheotomy in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury.A retrospective analysis was performed on 54 cases of severe C4-C8 cervical spinal cord injury patients undergoing anterior fixation. They were classified as A and B according to the criteria of American Spinal Injury Association. And no tracheotomy was performed preoperatively. The patients with a high risk of dyspnea and with an indication for preventive tracheotomy received a preventive tracheotomy right after anterior fixation. 11 cases were classified into tracheotomy group and 43 cases were in non-tracheotomy group. The preoperative and hospital stays, incidence of hypoxemia and pulmonary infection, incidence of surgical incision site infection and mortality were analyzed between two groups.The preoperative and hospital stays of tracheotomy group were shorter than those of non-tracheotomy group (2.9 ± 1.2 vs 5.7 ± 4.4 days, 10.3 ± 4.0 vs 16.5 ± 9.2 days). The incidence of hypoxemia was lower in tracheotomy group (9.1% vs 44.2%). There was difference existed between two groups. 44.2% patients in the non-tracheotomy group underwent tracheotomy or endotracheal intubation for dyspnea and hypoxemia. There was no significant difference between two groups in the incidence of pulmonary infection (9.1% vs 7.0%) or surgical incision site infection (0 vs 2.3%). The mortality of non-tracheotomy group was 3.07 folds of that of tracheotomy group (9.1% vs 27.9%). But there was no significant statistical difference.The preventive tracheotomy is an effective solution for the patients with respiratory compromises, a high risk of dyspnea and with an indication for preventive tracheotomy. The preventive tracheotomy for severe cervical spinal cord can improve respiratory function effectively and fixation may be performed earlier. And there are lower rates of mortality and infection.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548393","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.789811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.691373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.66808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.584424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.552443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.540779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.402485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.281049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Hymenotomy","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenotomy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
