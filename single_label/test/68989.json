{"id":68989,"title":"Non-clinical safety assessment of Hwangryunhaedok-tang: 13-week toxicity in Crl:CD Sprague Dawley rats.","abstract":"Hwangryunhaedok-tang (Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in Chinese, Oren-gedoku-to in Japanese) is a traditional herbal medicine with a long history of use for anti-inflammatory purposes. In this study, subchronic toxicity of daily oral administration of a Hwangryunhaedok-tang water extract (HHT) at 0, 250, 750, and 2000mg/kg for 13weeks was examined in rats. Mortality, clinical signs, and changes in body weight, food consumption, clinical signs, ophthalmological examination, urinalysis, hematology, serum biochemistry, gross observation, organ weight, and histopathology were monitored in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice and OECD guidelines. We found no mortality or abnormality in clinical signs, body weight, serum biochemistry, or organ weight in HHT-treated groups in either sex. However, there were significant changes in glucose, bilirubin, urobilinogen, protein (only male) in urine after 2000mg/kg/day HHT treatment for both sexes. In hematological examinations, we found a significant decreased number of red blood cells (RBC), whereas, an increased the mean corpuscular volume, number of platelets, and rate of reticulocyte (RET) after 2000mg/kg/day HHT treatment of male rats. In male and female rats, 750 and 2000mg/kg/day HHT treatment decreased the number of RBC and increased RET. Histopathological examinations revealed stomach mucosal erosion in female rats (2000mg/kg/day). No-observed-adverse-effect levels were established for 750mg/kg HHT in rats under the conditions of this study. However, other toxicological studies are necessary to evaluate the safety of HHT fully.
