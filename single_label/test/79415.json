{"id":79415,"title":"[The use of topical preparations for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the outer and middle ear: the problems of effectiveness and safety].","abstract":"The recently obtained data concerning the prevalence, etiology, clinical picture, and diagnostics of the inflammatory diseases of the outer and middle ear are presented. The importance of the adequate medicamental treatment of the main components of the inflammatory process in the outer and middle ears is emphasized. The medicinal products possessed of local antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities are shown to have advantages over other preparations used for the management of the above pathologies. The choice of a concrete agent depends on the extent of the inflammatory process, its stage, and specific features of the clinical picture in a given patient. The literature review of the published clinical studies demonstrated the therapeutic effectiveness of otofa and polydexa when applied for the treatment of outer and middle ear pathology.
