{"id":83217,"title":"Impact of bariatric surgery on oral health conditions: 6-months cohort study.","abstract":"We evaluate oral health conditions before and after bariatric surgery.The sample was composed of 59 patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Salivary flow, periodontal pocket depth and dental wear were evaluated before and after 6 months of surgery. Body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and glucose levels were obtained from the patient's medical files. A t-test was used for dependent samples.The mean BMI decreased from 49.31 ± 8.76 to 35.52 ± 8.12 kg/m(2) in 6 months after surgery (P < 0.000). Before surgery, 67% of patients had high levels of CRP and 38% higher blood glucose levels and after surgery there were significant reductions in these levels (P < 0.001). Salivary flow ranged from 0.84 to 0.95 ml/min. There was increased prevalence of periodontal pockets (P = 0.022) and mean pocket depth increased to about 0.5 mm (P < 0.001). The percentage of surfaces with dental wear in dentine was significantly higher after bariatric surgery (P = 0.002), while dental wear in enamel decreased (P = 0.019).Bariatric surgery may improve systemic conditions. However, it had a negative impact on oral health conditions because of an increase in periodontal disease and dental wear.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410073","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.706059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.687488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.607236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.573737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.528691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Gingival and periodontal pocket","weight":0.513821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_and_periodontal_pocket"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.445331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.429832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.310564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.233634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"}]}
