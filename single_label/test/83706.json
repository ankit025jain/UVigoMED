{"id":83706,"title":"Nasal septal body and inferior turbinate sizes differ in subjects grouped by sex and age.","abstract":"To compare the size of the nasal septal body (SB) and inferior turbinate (IT) of subjects grouped by sex and age.We measured SB and IT areas (in cm2) bilaterally in computed tomography (CT) sections of 150 para nasal sinuses from 72 males and 78 females.The right and left SB areas were smaller in females than in males. In the s25-year-old group, the right IT (RIT) was significantly smaller in females than in males. In the 26-35 and 46-45 age groups, the right SB (RSB) was significantly smaller in females than in males.The nasal SB may play a role in nasal physiology similar to a turbinate and help support optimal airflow. The vascular and glandular structures of the SB should be investigated in detail, and minimal invasive procedures should be performed in nasal surgery to avoid damaging essential structures.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25271528","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.81067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.290737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Nasal concha","weight":0.274681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_concha"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.179322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Para (currency)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para_(currency)"},{"name":"Rajapur Saraswat Brahmins","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajapur_Saraswat_Brahmins"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Rochester Institute of Technology","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
