{"id":73163,"title":"Induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis by apigenin by inhibiting STAT3 signaling in HER2-overexpressing MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells.","abstract":"This study aimed to examine the effect of apigenin on proliferation and apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells.The antiproliferative effects of apigenin were examined by proliferation and MTT assays. The effect of apigenin on apoptotic molecules was determined by western blotting. RT-PCR was performed to measure mRNA levels of HIF-1? and VEGF. ELISA assay was performed to measure intracellular VEGF levels. Immunocytochemistry was performed to evaluate nuclear STAT3 level.Apigenin inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-453 cells. Apigenin up-regulated the levels of cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3, and induced the cleavage of PARP. Apigenin induced extrinsic apoptosis and blocked the activation (phosphorylation) of JAK2 and STAT3. Apigenin inhibited CoCl2-induced VEGF secretion and decreased the nuclear staining of STAT3.Apigenin exerts its antiproliferative activity by inhibiting STAT3 signaling. Apigenin could serve as a useful compound to prevent or treat HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922650","annotations":[{"name":"Janus kinase 2","weight":0.916376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_2"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.901657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.802668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.770479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.766704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.757491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.751733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.746087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.644409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.381229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.326507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.29827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.257175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.156188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.0579754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Apigenin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apigenin"},{"name":"Immunocytochemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocytochemistry"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
