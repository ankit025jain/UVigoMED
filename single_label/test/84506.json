{"id":84506,"title":"Genetic diversity in Scots pine populations along a radiation exposure gradient.","abstract":"Polymorphisms of antioxidant enzymes were studied in the endosperm and embryos of seeds from Scots pine populations inhabiting sites in the Bryansk region of Russia radioactively contaminated as a result of the Chernobyl accident. Chronic radiation exposure at dose rates from 0.8 ?Gy/h led to a significant increase in the rate of enzymatic loci mutations. The main parameters of genetic variability of the affected Scots pine populations had considerably higher values than those from the reference site. Changes in the genetic makeup of Scots pine populations were observed at dose rates greater than 10.4 ?Gy/h. However, the higher mutation rate had no effect on the activities of antioxidant enzymes.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087063","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.888559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Endosperm","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosperm"},{"name":"Chernobyl disaster","weight":0.841285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.684315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.615169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Mutation rate","weight":0.542751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_rate"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Radioactive contamination","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.434462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.417045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Pine","weight":0.160331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine"},{"name":"Genetic variability","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variability"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pinus sylvestris","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_sylvestris"},{"name":"Bryansk","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryansk"},{"name":"Scotland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"}]}
