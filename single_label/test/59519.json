{"id":59519,"title":"The cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17) and Treg cytokine (TGF-beta1) levels in adults with immune thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"Previous studies have indicated that autoimmune diseases might be caused by an imbalance of T helper cells (Th), cytokines, and regulatory T cells (Treg) cytokines. We measured the plasma concentrations of Th1-associated cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2), Th2 -associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), Th17-associated cytokine (IL-17) and Treg -associated cytokine (TGF-beta1) in adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and evaluated their clinical relevance. Plasma IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and TGF-beta1 concentrations of 52 ITP patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (ELISA). Concentration of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were significantly higher in ITP patients compared to controls (P < 0.05). However, concentrations of Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2), Th17 cytokine (IL-17) and Treg cytokine (TGF-beta1) were lower in ITP patients (P < 0.05). Concentration of IL-17 was significantly higher in chronic ITP patients compared to severe ITP patients (P < 0.05), and no significant difference of cytokine concentration among the other subgroups in ITP patients was found. Among the ITP patients, concentration of IFN-gamma correlated positively and significantly with PAIgG (r = 0.48, P = 0.02). A significant correlation was neither found between other cytokine levels and platelet count, nor between cytokine levels and megakaryocytes number, nor between cytokines levels and PAIgG or GPIIb/IIIa and/or GPIb/IX autoantibodies. The present study demonstrates that an imbalance of Th and Treg cytokines may mediate the pathogenesis of ITP.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272942","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.914879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.902645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.857895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.778971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.72666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.716916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.648768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.643078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.633024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Megakaryocyte","weight":0.587584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megakaryocyte"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.540061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa","weight":0.168048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein_IIb/IIIa"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
