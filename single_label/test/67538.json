{"id":67538,"title":"Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins in experimental benign prostatic hyperplasia: effects of serenoa repens, selenium and lycopene.","abstract":"The apoptosis machinery is a promising target against benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) modulate apoptosis by direct inhibition of caspases. Serenoa Repens (SeR) may be combined with other natural compounds such as Lycopene (Ly) and Selenium (Se) to maximize its therapeutic activity in BPH. We investigated the effects of SeR, Se and Ly, alone or in association, on the expression of four IAPs, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, NAIP and survivin in rats with experimental testosterone-dependent BPH. Moreover, caspase-3, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been evaluated.Rats were administered, daily, with testosterone propionate (3 mg/kg/sc) or its vehicle for 14 days. Testosterone injected animals (BPH) were randomized to receive vehicle, SeR (25 mg/kg/sc), Se (3 mg/kg/sc), Ly (1 mg/kg/sc) or the SeR-Se-Ly association for 14 days. Animals were sacrificed and prostate removed for analysis.BPH animals treated with vehicle showed unchanged expression of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 and increased expression of NAIP, survivin, caspase-3, IL-6 and PSMA levels when compared with sham animals. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the enhanced expression of NAIP and survivin with a characteristic pattern of cellular localization. SeR-Se-Ly association showed the highest efficacy in reawakening apoptosis; additionally, this therapeutic cocktail significantly reduced IL-6 and PSMA levels. The administration of SeR, Se and Ly significantly blunted prostate overweight and growth; moreover, the SeR-Se-Ly association was most effective in reducing prostate enlargement and growth by 43.3% in treated animals.The results indicate that IAPs may represent interesting targets for drug therapy of BPH.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606563","annotations":[{"name":"Lycopene","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.839829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.689373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.673938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.629308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.575423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.56631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.550423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Serenoa","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenoa"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0673439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Propanoate","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propanoate"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Prostate specific membrane antigen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_specific_membrane_antigen"},{"name":"Inhibitor of apoptosis","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitor_of_apoptosis"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"}]}
