{"id":91501,"title":"[Clinical observation of visual quality after aspherical intraocular lens implantation in traumatic cataract].","abstract":"To observe the visual quality of aspherical intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in traumatic cataract patients.Prospective clinical study.96 traumatic cataract patients (96 eyes) suffered from penetrating corneal trauma chosen from the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou university during June 2009 to June 2012. They were divided into two groups based on the different type of intraocular lens. The experimental group (48 eyes) was implanted with aspherical IOL and the control group (48 eyes) was implanted with traditional sphere IOL.Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (CS) and stereoscopic vision were observed at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. At the same time, questionnaire survey about the satisfaction of patients was also performed. The t test was used to compare the preoperative general condition, postoperative visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and stereoscopic vision of the two groups, and the rank sum test was used to compare the astigmatism and the satisfaction of patients.There was no significant difference in UCVA (t = 1.37, 1.28,0.71, P > 0.05) between the experimental group (0.56 ± 0.22, 0.68 ± 0.13,0.84 ± 0.15) and the control group (0.51 ± 0.17, 0.61 ± 0.20,0.81 ± 0.17) at three time points. There was no significant difference in BCVA (t = 0.87, 1.38, 1.39, P > 0.05) between the experimental group (0.62 ± 0.13, 0.74 ± 0.21, 0.87 ± 0.10) and the control group (0.57 ± 0.25,0.69 ± 0.22,0.84 ± 0.15) . The same result happened in stereoscopic vision at 6 months after surgery (far stereopsis:123.5 ± 7.8 vs 126. 9 ± 5.9, t = 0.64, P > 0.05;near stereopsis:90.5 ± 7.8 vs 95.2 ± 3.5; t = 1.36, P > 0.05) between experimental group and control group. The contrast sensitivity of the experimental group in every stage (3 c/d:1.52 ± 0.18, 6 c/d:1.68 ± 0.19, 12 c/d:1.29 ± 0.14, 18 c/d:1.04 ± 0.20) was superior to the control group (3 c/d:1.49 ± 0.27, 6 c/d:1.57 ± 0.21, 12 c/d:1.14 ± 0.20, 18 c/d:0.85 ± 0.14) , especially on the glare sensitivity (the experimental group:3 c/d:1.40 ± 0.15, 6 c/d:1.52 ± 0.22, 12 c/d:1.21 ± 0.18, 18 c/d:0.91 ± 0.14, the control group:3 c/d:1.13 ± 0.13, 6 c/d:1.13 ± 0.28, 12 c/d:0.92 ± 0.13, 18 c/d:0.54 ± 0.16) Compared two groups of difference have statistical significance (free from glare:3 c/d:t = 2.829, 6 c/d:t = 4.092, 12 c/d:t = 3.055, 18 c/d:t = 2.093;glare:3 c/d:t = 2.650, 6 c/d:t = 3.105, 12 c/d:t = 3.395, 18 c/d:t = 2.215;P < 0.05) .Questionnaire survey showed the experimental group (72.9%) was statistically significantly higher (t = 3.016, P < 0.05) than that in the control group (54.1%) on the satisfaction of patients.The visual quality with implantation of aspherical IOL in traumatic cataract patients is superior to traditional sphere IOL. Aspherical IOL is more appropriate for the patients with small and peripheral corneal scar.It can reduce the visual function damage to minimum caused by trauma.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499699","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.916034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.753231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.710083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.664199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.63608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.607639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Stereopsis","weight":0.596395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereopsis"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.490187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.461043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.445552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"University","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Glare (vision)","weight":0.0376828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_(vision)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Aspheric lens","weight":0.0107573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspheric_lens"}]}
