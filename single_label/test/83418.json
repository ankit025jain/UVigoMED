{"id":83418,"title":"Core decompression with bone marrow injection for the treatment of femoral head osteonecrosis.","abstract":"Core decompression has been recommended in treatment of non-traumatic femoral head necrosis in early stage. Injection with patient's own bone marrow from the iliac crest might promote bone formation in the femoral head.To evaluate the result of patients treated by this technique.Retrospective review of a series cases by the medical records and radiographic pictures.There were 34 procedures from 32 patients. Mean follow-up time was 24.6 months in stage 2 and 27.8 months in stage 3. Radiographic progression was observed in 76% and 69% of stage 2 and 3. Twenty one percent of stage 2 hips underwent other surgeries when 46% of stage 3 did at last follow-up. Pain relief was observed in all cases after the surgery.The proposed technique yielded only fair results. Probably due to most patients had steroid related pathology.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25365907","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Iliac crest","weight":0.722619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliac_crest"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.629896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.536216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.27987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.241581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.129516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Stage (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Crest (heraldry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"}]}
