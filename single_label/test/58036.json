{"id":58036,"title":"A consensus on acne management focused on specific patient features.","abstract":"Most treatment guidelines for acne are based on clinical severity. Our objective was to expand that approach to one that also comprised individualized patient features: a case-based approach.An expert panel of Canadian dermatologists was established to develop demographic and clinical features considered to be particularly important in acne treatment selection. A nominal group consensus process was used for inclusion of features and corresponding appropriate treatments.Consensus was achieved on the following statements: follicular epithelial dysfunction contributes to acne pathogenesis; inflammation from underlying disease(s) or prior treatment may impact further patient management; management focusing on specific patient features and on addressing psychosocial factors, including impact on quality of life, may improve treatment adherence and outcomes; and case-based scenarios are a practical approach to illustrate the effect of these factors. To address the latter, eight case profiles were developed.Management of acne should be based on multifactorial considerations beyond clinically determined acne severity and should include patient-reported impact, gender, skin sensitivity (including preexisting dermatoses), and phototype.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008441","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acne","weight":0.470628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.455396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.392179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.247891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.134985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.122521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0569818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0522387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.0518128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_Guidelines_from_The_Medical_Letter"},{"name":"Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_of_the_Secretary-General's_Panel_of_Experts_on_Accountability_in_Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
