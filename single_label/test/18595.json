{"id":18595,"title":"Identification of clinical yeasts by Vitek MS system compared with API ID 32 C.","abstract":"We performed a clinical evaluation of the Vitek MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system with the commercial database version 2.0 for rapid identification of medically important yeasts as compared with the conventional phenotypic method API ID 32 C. We tested 161 clinical isolates, nine isolates from culture collections and five reference strains. In case of discrepant results or no identification with one or both methods, molecular identification techniques were employed. Concordance between both methods was observed with 160/175 isolates (91.42%) and misidentifications by both systems occurred only when taxa were not included in the respective databases, i.e., one isolate of Candida etchellsii was identified as C. globosa by Vitek MS and two isolates of C. orthopsilosis were identified as C. parapsilosis by API ID 32 C. Vitek MS could not identify nine strains (5.14%) and API ID 32 C did not identify 13 (7.42%). Vitek MS was more reliable than API ID 32 C and reduced the time required for the identification of clinical isolates to only a few minutes.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782106","annotations":[{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.658814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.445262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.39279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.39194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.375617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0778537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Application programming interface","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Yosemite Decimal System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Decimal_System"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"LexisNexis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LexisNexis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Desorption","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desorption"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
