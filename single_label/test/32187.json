{"id":32187,"title":"Surgical outcomes of 380 patients with double outlet right ventricle who underwent biventricular repair.","abstract":"The study objective was to report the outcomes of biventricular repair in patients with double outlet right ventricle.Patients with double outlet right ventricle who underwent biventricular repair at Fuwai Hospital from January 2005 to December 2012 were included. Patients were excluded if double outlet right ventricle was combined with atrioventricular septal defect, heterotaxy syndrome, atrioventricular discordance, or univentricular physiology.A total of 380 consecutive patients with a mean age of 1.9 ± 2.1 years (range, 1 month to 6 years) were included. Varied types of biventricular repair were customized individually. Follow-up was 90.4% complete, and the mean follow-up time was 3.4 ± 3.9 years. There were 17 (4.5%) early deaths and 7 (2.1%) late deaths. Preoperative pulmonary hypertension was the only risk factor for early mortality. Postoperative significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was present in 9 survivors. Patients with noncommitted ventricular septal defect had a longer crossclamp time, longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, and higher incidence of postdischarge left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There were 4 reoperations, all of which were caused by subaortic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. All of the pressure gradients were decreased to less than 20 mm Hg after the modified Konno procedure with an uneventful postoperative course.Optimal results of varied types of biventricular repair for double outlet right ventricle have been acquired. Although noncommitted ventricular septal defect is technically difficult, the outcomes of patients are favorable. Late-onset left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is the main reason for reoperation but can be successfully relieved by the modified Konno procedure.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997522","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Double outlet right ventricle","weight":0.833031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_outlet_right_ventricle"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Atrioventricular septal defect","weight":0.63523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.523998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Atrioventricular node","weight":0.495518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_node"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.417797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Situs ambiguus","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situs_ambiguus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Ventricular outflow tract","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_outflow_tract"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.110579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
