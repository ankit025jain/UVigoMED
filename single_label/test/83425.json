{"id":83425,"title":"Optimisation of rheumatology indices: dactylitis and enthesitis in psoriatic arthritis.","abstract":"Outcome measures are a key part of study design and clinical assessment. Enthesitis and dactylitis are typical features of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and the spondyloarthritides but traditionally scoring systems for enthesitis have mainly been validated in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). There are many scoring systems which are not validated used for dactylitis although newer validated scores are now available. Recently there have been advances in composite scores that include enthesitis and dactylitis to assess disease activity. These are currently being validated further and have not yet been tested in routine clinical practice.
