{"id":91624,"title":"Posttraumatic superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis in a 2 years old.","abstract":"Superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis (SOVT) usually results from inflammatory, infectious, or malignant causes. This case describes a 2-year-old boy with severe prolapsing chemosis and proptosis due to thrombosis of the right superior ophthalmic vein resulting from midfacial and right orbital fractures 1 week after the initial trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging and internal carotid artery angiogram are essential in the diagnosis of SOVT. The literature on issues surrounding this case was reviewed with emphasis on the diagnostic evaluation, differential diagnoses, and management of posttraumatic SOVT.
