{"id":78389,"title":"[Phonological development in children with cochlear implant(s)].","abstract":"Normal-hearing children show signs of various phonological processes during language development. These processes represent simplifications of articulation, which are overcome at different time points. For the German language, there are currently no reliable data regarding whether these developmental stages also apply to deaf children with cochlear implants (CI).Phonological development in deaf children with CI was examined and evaluated with the PLAKSS (\"Psycholinguistischen Analyse kindlicher Sprechstörungen\"). The results of this analysis (time of test 1?= T1, n?=?33) were compared to those of a PLAKSS diagnostic evaluation performed 1 year previously (time of test 0?= T0, n?=?31).At T1, 76?% of the whole group showed a phonological development that did not correspond to their hearing age (as measured from the time of the first CI implantation). The most frequently observed phonological processes were the reduction of consonant clusters and fronting. However, 83?% of the group had fewer phonological processes inappropriate to their hearing age at T1 than they did at T0.The phonological development of children with CI is not equivalent to their hearing age and is structured differently to that of normal-hearing children.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682251","annotations":[{"name":"German language","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.640241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Phonology","weight":0.636415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.556912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.340397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Consonant","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.191098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Manner of articulation","weight":0.124642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation"},{"name":"Language development","weight":0.111981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_development"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sign language","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Phonological development","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_development"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Kolmogorov space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_space"},{"name":"Country code top-level domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain"},{"name":"Consonant cluster","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_cluster"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Constructivism (learning theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Analyse (song)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyse_(song)"}]}
