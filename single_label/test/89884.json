{"id":89884,"title":"Team training in ruptured EVAR.","abstract":"Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms are almost always a fatal condition. The incidence of ruptured aortic aneurysms (rAAA) is declining, the number of teams is increasing and there is an increased focus on patient safety resulting in limited real life training opportunities to maintain or improve the technical and human factor skills required to manage this acute aortic pathology. The availability and experience of the multidisciplinary team together with accessibility of appropriate resuscitation and efficient logistics all influence the modality of rAAA repair. A standardised patient's pathway for rAAA management and reliable multidisciplinary team are the keys to improve patient outcomes. Whole rEVAR team training using high fidelity simulation may be the one answer to allow clinicians to learn, practice, rehearse, improve and maintain team-based knowledge, technical and human factor skills and team attitudes to manage this challenging pathology.
