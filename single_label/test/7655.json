{"id":7655,"title":"Effective knock down of matrix metalloproteinase-13 by an intra-articular injection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a murine surgically-induced osteoarthritis model.","abstract":"This study investigated the effect of MMP-13 gene knock down on cartilage degradation by injecting small interfering RNA (siRNA) into knee joints in a mouse model of osteoarthritis (OA). OA was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM) surgery. Change of Mmp13 expression over time was determined by qPCR analysis from 3 days to 6 weeks after surgery. Mmp13 and control chemically modified siRNA were injected into the knee joint 1 week after surgery and expression levels were assessed in synovium by qPCR 48?h later. Cartilage degradation was histologically assessed 8 weeks after DMM surgery according to OARSI recommendations. Mmp13 expression levels were elevated 1 week after surgery and peaked at 77 fold at 2 weeks compared to expression at 3 days. A 55% decrease of Mmp13 levels in cartilage was observed 48 h after injection of Mmp13 siRNA (p = 0.05). Significant reduction in the histological score at 8 weeks after surgery was observed in the Mmp13 siRNA-treated group compared to the control siRNA group (p < 0.001). Intra-articular injection of Mmp13 siRNA at the early phase of OA development resulted in effective knock down of Mmp13 expression and delay in cartilage degradation in vivo.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848439","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.748529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.716811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.679828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.526545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Medial meniscus","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_meniscus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.341876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.265579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.171192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.169303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0891297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Meniscus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus"},{"name":"Joint injection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_injection"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
