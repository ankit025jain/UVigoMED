{"id":76226,"title":"Part I: triggers for an evidence based practice project: managing peri-operative hyperglycemia in total hip and total knee replacement surgeries.","abstract":"A descriptive study of risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) in patients receiving total knee arthroplasty discovered an infection rate higher than the benchmark. Although no risk factors were significant predictors of SSI in this population, an important finding was that, despite a patient population with comorbid diabetes, a lack of standardized practice related to the identification and management of hyperglycemia was identified. These findings identified and validated an important practice issue and led to the continued commitment to improve glucose management. In this way, a study was a trigger for improved nursing practice using evidence-based practice.
