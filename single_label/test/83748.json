{"id":83748,"title":"Show me your friends, and I shall show you who you are: the way attachment and social comparisons influence body dissatisfaction.","abstract":"Women with attachment insecurity have greater eating disorder symptoms and poorer prognosis. Socio-cultural agents, such as peers and family, are predictive of the development of body image dissatisfaction (BID). The present study examines the association of insecure attachment styles and direct and indirect social comparisons of body image to women's BID and drive to thinness. Two hundred and eighty three women aged 18-42?years completed online self-reports concerning attachment styles, body mass index (BMI), drive for thinness, body image satisfaction, the Figure Rating Scale (FRS), as well as a modified FRS comparing self to mother, to sister closest in age and to best friend. Hierarchical Linear Models reveal that anxious-ambivalent, but not avoidant attachment style, along with indirect and direct comparisons to best friend and to sister influence drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction, even after controlling for BMI and age. Of all social comparisons, feeling one's best friend is thinner than yourself is the most detrimental to body ideal.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25257536","annotations":[{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.560569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.536506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.485619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.474975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Mary Ainsworth","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ainsworth"},{"name":"Attachment disorder","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_disorder"},{"name":"Royal Society","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society"},{"name":"Attachment in adults","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"1842","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1842"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Models (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_(band)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
