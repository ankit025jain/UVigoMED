{"id":45622,"title":"Totally percutaneous rendezvous techniques for the treatment of bile strictures and leakages.","abstract":"Some challenging pathologic conditions of the biliary tract cannot be treated with endoscopy alone, and a combined approach with rendezvous techniques is frequently needed. Three different totally percutaneous rendezvous techniques were successfully applied in three cases. The rendezvous techniques were performed either with bilateral catheterization of bile ducts to treat a challenging type IV biliary stenosis and iatrogenic biliary damage or with biliary catheterization and percutaneous puncture of the anastomotic loop to treat a biliodigestive anastomosis failure with bile leakage.
