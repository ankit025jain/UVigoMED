{"id":89143,"title":"Progress towards cell-based burn wound treatments.","abstract":"Cell therapy as part of the concept of regenerative medicine represents an upcoming platform technology. Although cultured epidermal cells have been used in burn treatment for decades, new developments have renewed the interest in this type of treatment. Whereas early results were hampered by long culture times in order to produce confluent sheets of keratinocytes, undifferentiated proliferating cells can nowadays be applied on burns with different application techniques. The application of cells on carriers has improved early as well as long-term results in experimental settings. The results of several commercially available epidermal substitutes for burn wound treatment are reviewed in this article. These data clearly demonstrate a lack of randomized comparative trials and application of measurable outcome parameters. Experimental research in culture systems and animal models has demonstrated new developments and proof of concepts of further improvements in epidermal coverage. These include combinations of epidermal cells and mesenchymal stem cells, and the guidance of both material and cell interactions towards regeneration of skin appendages as well as vascular and nerve structures.
