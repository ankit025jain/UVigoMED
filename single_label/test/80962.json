{"id":80962,"title":"[Effect of environmental change in marshland after implementation of Three Gorges Reservoir Project on schistosomiasis in Jiangsu Province].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of environmental change in marshland after the implementation of the Three Gorges Reservoir Project on schistosomiasis in Jiangsu Province.The hydrologic data of Nanjing City in Jiangsu section of the Yangtze River, and the data regarding the marshlands, the snail status and schistosomiasis morbidity in areas adjacent to the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province were collected, and field snail surveys were performed in typical marshlands.Following the implementation of the Three Gorges Reservoir Project, the water level in Nanjing section of the Yangtze River appeared a year-dependent gradual decline tendency. The mean peak water level on January to March, 2012 (spring) increased by 0.41 m as compared to that before the construction of the project in 2002, while the peak water level on April to December, 2012 decreased by 0.32 m as compared to that before the construction of the project in 2002. The endemic situation of schistosomiasis showed a decline tendency in areas adjacent to the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province. The area with infected snails along the Yangtze River was 0, the positive rates of serological tests and parasitological tests of the population were 0.73% and 0.004%, respectively in 2012.Both the schistosomiasis morbidity and snail status appear a decline tendency in areas adjacent to the Yangtze River along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Jiangsu Province after the implementation of the Three Gorges Reservoir Project.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490388","annotations":[{"name":"Yangtze River","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Peak water","weight":0.706908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_water"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.638159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Hydrology","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Marsh","weight":0.428337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.418467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.391766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.344145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.266486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.222019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.217222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.206147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.19349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Spring (hydrosphere)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Water table","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_table"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Three Gorges","weight":0.0165534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
