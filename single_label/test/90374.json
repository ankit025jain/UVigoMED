Furthermore, compared with handcycling, the overall heart rate and ventilation during hybrid cycling was 11 bpm (11%) and 5.3 l/minute (18%) higher (P = 0.004 and 0.024), respectively, while the oxygen pulse was the same (P = 0.26).Hybrid cycling induces a higher metabolic rate and cardiorespiratory response at equal RPE levels than handcycling, suggesting that hybrid cycling is more suitable for fighting obesity and increasing cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals with SCI.","date":"2014-11-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621028","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Tetraplegia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraplegia"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.752008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.649401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.579322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.52604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.448154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Cycling","weight":0.289532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.287592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.218435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Gas exchange","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_exchange"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Amsterdam","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Physical medicine and rehabilitation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Handcycle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcycle"},{"name":"Joule","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
