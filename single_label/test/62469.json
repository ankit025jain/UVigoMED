{"id":62469,"title":"Towards precision medicine in childhood leukemia--insights from mutationally activated cytokine receptor pathways in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","abstract":"The successful therapy of childhood leukemia has been characterized by careful personalized adaptation of therapy by risk stratification. Yet almost all drugs are relatively non-specific. To achieve greater precision in therapy, druggable targets and specific targeting drugs are necessary. Here we review the recent discoveries of cytokine receptors and their signaling components in high risk leukemias and the potential approaches to target them.
