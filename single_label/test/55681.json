{"id":55681,"title":"Visual and anatomical outcomes following intravitreal aflibercept in eyes with recalcitrant neovascular age-related macular degeneration: 12-month results.","abstract":"To describe the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept on 12-month visual and anatomical outcomes in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) recalcitrant to prior monthly intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab.Non-comparative case series of 21 eyes of 21 AMD patients with evidence of persistent exudation (intraretinal fluid/cysts, or subretinal fluid (SRF), or both) on spectral domain OCT despite ?6 prior intravitreal 0.5?mg ranibizumab or 1.25?mg bevacizumab (mean 29.8±17.1 injections) over 31.6±17.4 months who were transitioned to aflibercept.At baseline, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.42±0.28 logarithm of minimum-angle of resolution (logMAR), central foveal thickness (CFT) was 329.38±102.67??m and macular volume (MV) was 7.71±1.32?mm(3). After 12 months of aflibercept (mean 10.2±1.2 injections), BCVA was 0.40±0.28 logMAR (P=0.5), CFT decreased to 292.71±91.35??m (P=0.038) and MV improved to 7.33±1.27?mm(3) (P=0.003). In a subset of 15 eyes with a persistent fibrovascular or serous pigment epithelial detachment (PED), mean baseline PED greatest basal diameter (GBD) was 2350.9±1067.6??m and mean maximal height (MH) was 288.7±175.9??m. At 12 months, GBD improved to 1896.3±782.3??m (P=0.028), while MH decreased to 248.27±146.2??m (P=0.002).In patients with recalcitrant AMD, aflibercept led to anatomic improvement at 12 months, reduction in proportion of eyes with SRF and reduction in PED, while preserving visual acuity.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Eye
