{"id":82005,"title":"Second Class Resolver: a retrospective analysis.","abstract":"To evaluate the use of Second Class Resolver (SCR), a new fixed orthopaedic appliance, for the treatment of skeletal Class II malocclusion in growing subjects.Design Retrospective analysis. Forty subjects were treated with Second Class Resolver (SCR). The mean age was 8 years at the beginning of treatment and 10 years at the end of treatment. Digital cephalometric superimpositions on lateral radiographs taken at start and end of treatment were assessed. The cephalometric values were statistically analysed.Cephalometric analysis of changes during treatment shows reduction of ANB angle (mean 2°); reduction of Witts Index (mean 3 mm); reduction of Maxillo-Mandibular angle (MM) (mean 1°); reduction of SNA (angle mean 3°); reduction of gonial angle (mean 1.8°); increase of the mandibular branch length (mean 5 mm); increase of mandibular body (mean 2.9°).The Second Class Resolver can be beneficially used for the treatment of Class II malocclusion.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745598","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.443581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.370274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cephalometric analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometric_analysis"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Mandibular nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_nerve"},{"name":"TV Asahi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Asahi"},{"name":"Petty Officer Second Class","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_Officer_Second_Class"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"IBM Systems Network Architecture","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Systems_Network_Architecture"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0138715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Resolver (Veruca Salt album)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolver_(Veruca_Salt_album)"}]}
