{"id":80538,"title":"Leishmania (Leishmania) martiniquensis n. sp. (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), description of the parasite responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Martinique Island (French West Indies).","abstract":"The parasite responsible for autochthonous cutaneous leishmaniasis in Martinique island (French West Indies) was first isolated in 1995; its taxonomical position was established only in 2002, but it remained unnamed. In the present paper, the authors name this parasite Leishmania (Leishmania) martiniquensis Desbois, Pratlong & Dedet n. sp. and describe the type strain of this taxon, including its biological characteristics, biochemical and molecular identification, and pathogenicity. This parasite, clearly distinct from all other Euleishmania, and placed at the base of the Leishmania phylogenetic tree, is included in the subgenus Leishmania.
