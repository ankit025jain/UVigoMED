{"id":65634,"title":"Molecular biomarkers for predicting outcomes in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.","abstract":"Molecular biomarkers are used routinely in the clinical management of several tumours such as prostate, colon, ovarian and pancreatic cancer but management decisions in bladder cancer remain dependent on clinical and pathological criteria, which are limited in their ability to predict outcomes. Molecular markers are urgently needed in detection, surveillance and prognostication of bladder cancer as well as to predict treatment response to intravesical and systemic therapies. Advances in cancer genomics and platforms for biomarker profiling have led to a plethora of biomarkers, which must now be rigorously validated in the clinical setting. Pre-clinical and clinical studies exploring the role of emerging targeted therapies to risk stratify and reduce cancer progression are also needed.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798156","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.726839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.679189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.60838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.236567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.225821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.219567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Molecular marker","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_marker"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
