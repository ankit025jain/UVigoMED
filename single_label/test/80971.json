{"id":80971,"title":"[Surveillance of intestinal nematode infections in Nanjing City from 2008 to 2012].","abstract":"To understand the intestinal nematode infection status of Nanjing City, so as to provide the evidence for formulating the preventive strategy and measures.The eggs of intestinal nematodes were detected by Kato-Katz technique in population and eggs of Enterobius vermicularis were detected in children and low-grade primary school students by the transparent adhesive tape anal swab method.The fecal specimens from 45,645 individuals were tested, and of those, 167 were found to be infected with intestinal nematodes. The total infection rate was 0.36%, and the infection rates of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura were 0.18%, 0.03%, and 0.15%, respectively. Totally 43,356 children and low-grade primary school students were surveyed for Enterobius vermicularis infection, and the infection rate was 0.31%.The prevalence of intestinal nematodes of population is low in Nanjing City. However, we still need to strengthen health education and regular monitoring.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490379","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.840498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.833244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Enterobius","weight":0.765288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobius"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.713858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Trichuris trichiura","weight":0.691256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris_trichiura"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.492493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.488884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Adhesive tape","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive_tape"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Trichinosis","weight":0.0241609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"645","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/645"},{"name":"356","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/356"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"}]}
