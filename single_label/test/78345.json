{"id":78345,"title":"Progesterone receptor expression in sinonasal leiomyoma: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Leiomyomas are benign myogenic tumors that seldom occur in the sinonasal cavity. They were commonly found in middle-aged adults with a female predominance. Clinical symptoms include nasal obstruction with discharge, nasal bleeding and pain. We describe the case of a 48 year-old woman with a leiomyoma arising from right inferior nasal turbinate. Transnasal endoscopic excision was performed with satisfied result. The tumor was found to be progesterone receptor positive on immunohistochemical analysis. The clinical findings are addressed with a review of the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the third reported case that supports the growth of the tumor may be hormone-dependent.
