{"id":43589,"title":"Extracellular matrix protein 1 is correlated to carcinogenesis and lymphatic metastasis of human gastric cancer.","abstract":"Tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis is a crucial step in malignant invasion and metastasis. Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) was recently reported to play a role in lymphangiogenesis. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the role of ECM1 in gastric cancer and examined whether aberrant expression of ECM1 increased the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of human gastric cancer.The mRNA and protein expression of ECM1 in gastric cancer specimen and the noncancerous counterparts from 77 patients were detected by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry staining. Lymphatic microvessel density (LMVD) in the corresponding serial sections was assessed by counting the lymphatic microvessels labelled by D2-40. The correlations between ECM1 expression, LMVD, and the clinicopathological parameters were examined.ECM1 protein expression was detected in 70.1% (54/77) of gastric cancer specimen, significantly higher than that in the corresponding counterparts (P<0.01). ECM1 mRNA in tumor specimen was also dramatically amplified. Elevated LMVD and ECM1 were positively correlated (P<0.01). In addition, ECM1 protein expression was also closely associated with depth of tumor invasion and TNM stage (P<0.05, respectively).ECM1 expression is aberrant elevated in tumor specimen and is closely related to the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of human gastric cancer. Thus, carrying out the protein examination may be beneficial to predict carcinogenesis and metastatic spread of human gastric cancer.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779890","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.828729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.737248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.715183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.580006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Lymphangiogenesis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphangiogenesis"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Viral matrix protein","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_matrix_protein"}]}
