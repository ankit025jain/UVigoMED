{"id":7878,"title":"Serological screening suggests presence of Schmallenberg virus in cattle, sheep and goat in the Zambezia Province, Mozambique.","abstract":"Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a novel Orthobunyavirus within the family Bunyaviridae belonging to the Simbu serogroup. Schmallenberg virus infects ruminants and has since its discovery in the autumn 2011 been detected/spread to large parts of Europe. Most bunyaviruses are arboviruses, and SBV has been detected in biting midges in different European countries, suggesting that they may play a role in the transmission of the virus. It is not known how SBV was introduced to Europe and if SBV is present in countries outside of Europe. Thus, in this study, we conducted a serological screening for SBV antibodies in cattle (no. 79), sheep (no. 145) and goat (no. 141) in the Zambezia Province in Mozambique during September 2013. The results show a high percentage of antibody-positive animals. All farms tested had seropositive animals; cattle displayed the highest prevalence with 100% positive animals. Sheep and goat also displayed high number of positive animals with a 43-97% and 72-100% within-herd seroprevalence, respectively. This initial serological screening suggests that SBV is present on the African continent. However, cross-reactivity with other members of the Simbu serogroup cannot be ruled out, and further studies are needed to identify and characterize the virus responsible for the antibody-positive results.
