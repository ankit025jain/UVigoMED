{"id":89625,"title":"Change in inflammatory markers and cognitive status in the oldest-old women from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures.","abstract":"To determine the association between interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-6 soluble receptor (sR), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNF-R1) and cognitive status in the oldest-old women.Twenty-year longitudinal cohort study.Four clinical sites in the United States.Women from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (N = 905; mean age 88.3 Â± 2.8 at cognitive status adjudication).At Year 20, cognitive status was adjudicated as normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia. Inflammatory markers were measured from blood serum at Years 10 and 16 in a random sample of women.Over 10 years, 199 (22.0%) women developed MCI and 145 (16.0%) dementia. There were no significant associations between IL-6 or sTNF-R1 and cognitive status. High IL-6-sR (? 37,401.36 pg/mL, highest tertile) at Year 16 was significantly associated with lower risk of dementia (odds ratio (OR) = 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.30-0.97) than in women with lower levels (<37,401.36 pg/mL, lower two tertiles). Women with high IL-6-sR at both time points (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.17-0.89) or who transitioned to a high level (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14-0.88) had a lower risk of dementia.In this cohort of white, high-functioning oldest-old women, a consistently high or an increasing level of IL-6-sR was associated with lower risk of dementia. Compared with other studies of younger-old adults, this suggests that the effect of inflammation on dementia may differ in younger-old and the oldest-old individuals. Understanding these differences will be crucial in interpreting results from ongoing clinical trials and in targeting therapeutic strategies to the oldest-old individuals.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697580","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.794734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.647339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.632635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.617862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.468348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.464881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.361876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.335984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.293902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.200458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Mild cognitive impairment","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Quantile","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
