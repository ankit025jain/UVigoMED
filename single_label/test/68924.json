{"id":68924,"title":"[CCAFU Recommendations 2013: Renal cancer].","abstract":"The renal sub Committee of the CCAFU established guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, evaluation and standard of care for renal cell carcinoma.2010 Guidelines were updated based on systematic literature search performed by the sub-Committee in Medline and PubMed databases to evaluate references, levels of evidence and grade of recommendation.Multiphasic CT is the standard imaging technique for renal tumors diagnosis. Percutaneous renal biopsies are increasingly important for the management of localized RCC. Partial Nephrectomy is the first option when technically feasible for cT1 tumours. Open surgery remains the standard approach for locally advanced RCCs. New drugs are available for the treatment of metastatic RCC while the role of nephrectomy needs to be established by the Carmena trial.Conservative and mini-invasive therapies are increasingly important for the management of localized RCC. Therapeutic armamentarium continues to increase in mRCC.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485292","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.92289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.730979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.66182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
