{"id":34436,"title":"Synthesis of 1,5-dideoxy-1,5-iminoribitol C-glycosides through a nitrone-olefin cycloaddition domino strategy: identification of pharmacological chaperones of mutant human lysosomal ?-galactosidase.","abstract":"We report herein a newly developed domino reaction that facilitates the synthesis of new 1,5-dideoxy-1,5-iminoribitol iminosugar C-glycosides 7a-e and 8. The key intermediate in this approach is a six-membered cyclic sugar nitrone that is generated in situ and trapped by an alkene dipolarophile via a [2 + 3] cycloaddition reaction to give the corresponding isooxazolidines 10a-e in a \"one-pot\" protocol. The iminoribitol C-glycosides 7a-e and 8 were found to be modest ?-galactosidase (bGal) inhibitors. However, compounds 7c and 7e showed \"pharmacological chaperone\" activity for mutant lysosomal bGal activity and facilitated its recovery in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts by 2-6-fold.
