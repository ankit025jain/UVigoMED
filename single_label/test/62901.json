{"id":62901,"title":"The clinical value of the quantitative detection of four cancer-testis antigen genes in multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Cancer-testis (CT) antigen genes might promote the progression of multiple myeloma (MM). CT antigens may act as diagnostic and prognostic markers in MM, but their expression levels and clinical implications in this disease are not fully understood. This study measured the expression levels of four CT antigen genes in Chinese patients with MM and explored their clinical implications.Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to quantify the expression of MAGE-C1/CT7, MAGE-A3, MAGE-C2/CT10 and SSX-2 mRNA in 256 bone marrow samples from 144 MM patients.In the newly diagnosed patients, the positive expression rates were 88.5% for MAGE-C1/CT7, 82.1% for MAGE-C2/CT10, 76.9% for MAGE-A3 and 25.6% for SSX-2. The expression levels and the number of co-expressed CT antigens correlated significantly with several clinical indicators, including the percentage of plasma cells infiltrating the bone marrow, abnormal chromosome karyotypes and the clinical course.MAGE-C1/CT7, MAGE-A3, MAGE-C2/CT10 and SSX-2 expression levels provide potentially effective clinical indicators for the auxiliary diagnosis and monitoring of treatment efficacy in MM.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499297","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.693938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.585327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.339585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.304085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"China","weight":0.282518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.279334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
