{"id":34373,"title":"Heat-transfer-based detection of SNPs in the PAH gene of PKU patients.","abstract":"Conventional neonatal diagnosis of phenylketonuria is based on the presence of abnormal levels of phenylalanine in the blood. However, for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis, direct detection of disease-correlated mutations is needed. To speed up and simplify mutation screening in genes, new technologies are developed. In this study, a heat-transfer method is evaluated as a mutation-detection technology in entire exons of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. This method is based on the change in heat-transfer resistance (R(th)) upon thermal denaturation of dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) on nanocrystalline diamond. First, ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) fragments that span the size range of the PAH exons were successfully immobilized on nanocrystalline diamond. Next, it was studied whether an R(th) change could be observed during the thermal denaturation of these DNA fragments after hybridization to their complementary counterpart. A clear R(th) shift during the denaturation of exon 5, exon 9, and exon 12 dsDNA was observed, corresponding to lengths of up to 123 bp. Finally, R(th) was shown to detect prevalent single-nucleotide polymorphisms, c.473G>A (R158Q), c.932T>C (p.L311P), and c.1222C>T (R408W), correlated with phenylketonuria, displaying an effect related to the different melting temperatures of homoduplexes and heteroduplexes.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741310","annotations":[{"name":"Phenylketonuria","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Phenylalanine","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Phenylalanine hydroxylase","weight":0.808201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Denaturation (biochemistry)","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.710373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.452922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Complementarity (molecular biology)","weight":0.190302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Next (novel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_(novel)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"SsDNA","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SsDNA"},{"name":"Diamond","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond"}]}
