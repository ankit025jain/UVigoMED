{"id":62413,"title":"Advances in the treatment of hematologic malignancies using immunoconjugates.","abstract":"Monoclonal antibody therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by significantly improving patient survival both in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Recent technological advances have increased the effectiveness of immunotherapy leading to its broader application in diverse treatment settings. Immunoconjugates (ICs) consist of a cytotoxic effector covalently linked to a monoclonal antibody that enables the targeted delivery of its therapeutic payload to tumors based on cell-surface receptor recognition. ICs are classified into 3 groups based on their effector type: immunotoxins (protein toxin), radioimmunoconjugates (radionuclide), and antibody drug conjugates (small-molecule drug). Optimization of each individual component of an IC (antibody, linker, and effector) is essential for therapeutic efficacy. Clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of ICs in hematologic malignancies both as monotherapy and in multiagent regimens in relapsed/refractory disease as well as frontline settings. These studies have yielded encouraging results particularly in lymphoma. ICs comprise an exciting group of therapeutics that promise to play an increasingly important role in the management of hematologic malignancies.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578502","annotations":[{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibody therapy","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody_therapy"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunotoxin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotoxin"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunoconjugate","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoconjugate"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.730262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.706523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.322201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Covalent bond","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.140857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
