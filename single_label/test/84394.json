{"id":84394,"title":"Novel treatment of nail psoriasis using the intense pulsed light: a one-year follow-up study.","abstract":"Pulsed dye laser has been used successfully in the treatment of nail psoriasis. Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been used in the treatment of plaque psoriasis using a 550-nm filter.To study the efficacy of IPL in the treatment of nail psoriasis.Twenty patients with finger and toe nail psoriasis were treated by IPL. Sessions were performed every 2 weeks for a maximum of 6 months. The Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score was calculated at baseline and 1 month after the last treatment session. Follow-up was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months.Patients received a mean of 8.63 Â± 3.6 IPL sessions. After treatment, there was significant improvement in the nail bed and matrix (p < .0001), and in the NAPSI (p < .0001). Nail bed showed improvement by 71.2%, whereas the nail matrix improvement was only 32.2%. The total NAPSI was 82.4%. Patient follow-up revealed relapse in 3 patients after 6 months.Intense pulsed light is a promising effective modality of treatment of nail psoriasis, which is easy to use, safe, and provide a long period of remission. This was confirmed by the elicited clinical improvement, NAPSI, and patient satisfaction.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111349","annotations":[{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.796699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.503349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Nail matrix","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_matrix"},{"name":"Dye laser","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye_laser"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.242916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Intense pulsed light","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intense_pulsed_light"},{"name":"Iran Pro League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Pro_League"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Psoriatic nails","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriatic_nails"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Grimm's Fairy Tales","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm's_Fairy_Tales"},{"name":"Filter (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(optics)"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"}]}
