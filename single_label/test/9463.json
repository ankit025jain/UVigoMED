{"id":9463,"title":"Effects of low ambient temperatures and dietary vitamin C supplement on growth performance, blood parameters, and antioxidant capacity of 21-day-old broilers.","abstract":"The study was conducted to determine the effects of low ambient temperature (LAT) and a vitamin C (VC) dietary supplement on the growth performance, blood parameters, and antioxidant capacity of 21-d-old broilers. A total of 400 one-day-old male Cobb broilers were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments as follows: 1) LAT and a basal diet; 2) LAT and a basal diet supplemented with 1,000 mg of VC/kg (LAT + VC); 3) normal ambient temperature (NAT) and a basal diet; 4) NAT and a basal diet supplemented with 1,000 mg of VC/kg (NAT + VC). All birds were fed to 21 d of age. Broilers in groups 1 and 2 were raised at 24 to 26째C during 1 to 7 d, and at 9 to 11째C during 8 to 21 d, whereas groups 3 and 4 were raised at 29 to 31째C during 1 to 7 d and at 24 to 26째C during 8 to 21 d. The LAT increased the feed conversion ratio during the whole experimental period (P < 0.01), whereas it increased heart index at 21 d (P < 0.05) and hematocrit and hemoglobin level at 14 d (P < 0.05). Supplementing the diet with VC increased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell count at 21 d (P < 0.05). At 21 d, LAT conditions decreased total antioxidant capacity in the serum, liver, and lungs (P < 0.05), and it also increased the levels of VC in the serum and liver, the amount of protein carbonylation in liver and lungs, and the malondialdehyde level in the lungs (P < 0.05). The addition of VC tended to increase the total antioxidant capacity level in serum (P < 0.1). Low ambient temperature resulted in oxidative stress for broilers that were fed from 1 to 21 d of age, whereas no significant effect was found on the antioxidant activity by dietary VC supplementation.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706967","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.60681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.599871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Room temperature","weight":0.302672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Broiler","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Carbonylation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonylation"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
