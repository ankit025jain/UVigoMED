{"id":78436,"title":"Association of IL1? and IL4 gene polymorphisms with nasal polyps in a Polish population.","abstract":"Imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines may regulate the inflammatory reaction in the nasal polyps. Polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the cytokines genes may influence their expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between an IL-1? and IL-4 promoter polymorphisms and nasal polyps. The C-511T promoter polymorphism of the IL-1? gene and C-590T promoter polymorphism of the IL-4 gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 208 Polish patients with nasal polyps and 200 healthy Polish subjects. The risk of susceptibility to NP was significantly higher in patients with NP who had -511 T/T genotype of IL1? than in controls (OR 3.07; 95Â % CI 1.18-7.99). No statistically significant differences were found between NP patients and the control group with regard to genotype distribution and allele frequencies of C/T polymorphism of IL4 gene. Our study demonstrated that the TT genotype for C-511T mutation associated with the risk of developing NP in a Polish population.
