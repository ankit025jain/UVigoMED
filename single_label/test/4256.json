{"id":4256,"title":"[Carcinogenic risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: classification and interpretation of the monitoring].","abstract":"The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread contaminants characterized by various chemical, physical and toxic properties. The characterization of occupational and environmental exposures and the use of suitable measurements protocols are very significant because their presence in mixtures and environmental persistency. In the past few years, the knowledge concerning carcinogenicity of PAHs have been reviewed, the mechanisms involved are the interaction of PAH's metabolites with DNA and oxidative damages. The main requirement for research concerns lack of knowledge on reference values and occupational exposure's assessment in particular PAHs sampling methods that can lead to combined measurements of vapor and aerosol mixtures. Aims of this study are to describe a possible occupational sources of PAHs providing also an update of mechanism involved in their carcinogenicity and risk calculation as is done in the TEF approach. The classifications provided by International Agencies and Institutions and the limit values adopted have been reviewed and taken into account.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369710","annotations":[{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.719171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Vapor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.524287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.501684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.348455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Polycyclic compound","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_compound"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
