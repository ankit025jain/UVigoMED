{"id":91293,"title":"Vitamin D deficiency in elderly people in Swedish nursing homes is associated with increased mortality.","abstract":"Institutionalised elderly people at northern latitudes may be at elevated risk for vitamin D deficiency. In addition to osteoporosis-related disorders, vitamin D deficiency may influence several medical conditions conferring an increased mortality risk. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association with mortality.The Study of Health and Drugs in the Elderly (SHADES) is a prospective cohort study among elderly people (>65 years) in 11 nursing homes in Sweden.We analysed the levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D? (25(OH)D?) at baseline. Vital status of the subjects was ascertained and hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality according to 25(OH)D? quartiles were calculated.We examined 333 study participants with a mean follow-up of 3 years. A total of 147 (44%) patients died within this period. Compared with the subjects in Q4 (25(OH)D? >48? nmol/l), HR (with 95% CI) for mortality was 2.02 (1.31-3.12) in Q1 (25(OH)D? <29 ?nmol/l) (P<0.05); 2.03 (1.32-3.14) in Q2 (25(OH)D? 30-37? nmol/l) (P<0.05) and 1.6 (1.03-2.48) in Q3 (25(OH)D? 38-47 ?nmol/l) (P<0.05). The mean 25(OH)D? concentration was 40.2? nmol/l (S.D. 16.0) and 80% had 25(OH)D? below 50? nmol/l. The vitamin D levels decreased from baseline to the second and third measurements.Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent and associated with increased mortality among the elderly in Swedish nursing homes. Strategies are needed to prevent, and maybe treat, vitamin D deficiency in the elderly in nursing homes and the benefit of vitamin D supplementation should be evaluated in randomised clinical trials.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520134","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.579468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.302835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.234115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Latitude","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Institutionalisation","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionalisation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Home run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"The Study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Study"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Q3","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q3"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
