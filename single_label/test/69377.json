{"id":69377,"title":"[Renal biopsies during the second trimester of pregnancy: report of two cases].","abstract":"Kidney biopsies were performed in two women during their 21st and 24th week of pregnancy. The first patient developed an abrupt nephrotic syndrome without hypertension or kidney failure. The pathological study disclosed diffuse podocyte alterations such as those observed in focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, which had a good response to steroidal treatment. The second patient had a progressive renal failure associated with non-nephrotic proteinuria. The biopsy disclosed a fibrillary glomerulopathy.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448866","annotations":[{"name":"Podocyte","weight":0.887813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocyte"},{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.81126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.585027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"}]}
