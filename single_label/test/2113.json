{"id":2113,"title":"The role of ultrasonography in the evaluation of diffuse liver disease.","abstract":"The use of ultrasonography (US) to detect and characterize diffuse liver disease can be challenging, but remains a useful tool for the diagnosis and management of many diffuse parenchymal liver diseases such as cirrhosis, steatosis, and malignancies. Newer techniques, such as elastography, are proving useful for earlier detection of hepatic parenchymal changes. The role of US in the assessment of possible biliary ductal obstruction is well established, and Doppler US may provide additional physiologic information regarding hepatic blood flow. US plays a central role in target selection and guidance of percutaneous liver biopsies.
