{"id":14151,"title":"Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of H2N7 avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic ducks in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, 2013.","abstract":"Two H2N7 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from domestic ducks in live poultry markets in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, 2013. All viruses were characterized by whole-genome sequencing with subsequent phylogenetic analysis and genetic comparison. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight viral genes showed that the viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage of AIVs and originated from genes reassortment among different viruses co-circulating in domestic ducks in Eastern China. The hemagglutinin cleavage site of all viruses indicated that the two strains were low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Considering the important role of the domestic ducks in the dissemination and reassortment of AIVs, continued surveillance of circulating H2 subtype AIVs in domestic ducks in live poultry markets is needed.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442671","annotations":[{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Reassortment","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassortment"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.809211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"China","weight":0.48376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.460982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.423496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.302783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.281725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Eurasia","weight":0.118068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.100079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Zhejiang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Provinces of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"}]}
