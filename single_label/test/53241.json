{"id":53241,"title":"Effects of uncomplicated vaginal delivery and epidural analgesia on fetal arterial acid-base parameters at birth in gestational diabetes.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of uncomplicated vaginal delivery and epidural analgesia on fetal acid-base parameters in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) compared with controls.A retrospective case-control study of 142 women with gestational diabetes and 284 controls. To evaluate the effect of diabetes and analgesia on acid-base status correcting for potential confounders we used ordered logistic equations including quartiles of fetal arterial acid-base parameters collected at birth as outcomes and categories of diabetes and epidural analgesia as explanatory variables.In the GDM group cord base deficit (-2.63 mmol/l, interquartile range [IQR]=4.2 to -0.65 mmol/l vs. -1.9 mmol/l, IQR=-3.3 to -0.2 mmol/l, p=0.009, odds ratio (OR)=1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-2.18) was lower and concentration of calcium higher (1.49 mmol/l, IQR=1.42-1.56 mmol/l vs. 1.47 mmol/l, IQR=1.41-1.51 mmol/l, p=0.009, OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.12-2.56) compared with controls. Epidural analgesia in the GDM group was associated with reduced cord concentration of glucose (84.0mg/dl [4.7 mmol/l], IQR=70-103.3mg/dl vs. 92.5mg/dl [5.1 mmol/l], IQR=76.5-121.8 mg/dl, p=0.004), lactate (2.65 mmol/l (IQR=1.80-4.20) vs. 3.70 mmol/l (IQR=2.90-5.55 mmol/l), p=0.002) and less pronounced base deficit (-2.05 mmol/l, IQR=-3.90 to -0.17 mmol/l vs. -2.8, IQR=-5.57 to -1.05 mmol/l, p=0.01, OR=0.7, 95% CI=0.49-0.99).In uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries, well-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus has potentially significant detrimental effects on fetal acid-base status at birth. Epidural analgesia reduces cord arterial glucose and lactates.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529563","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.93405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.743385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.578368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.522041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.518637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.424075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.355814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.318346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.264458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"804","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/804"},{"name":"284","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/284"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"GNOME Display Manager","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager"}]}
