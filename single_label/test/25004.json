{"id":25004,"title":"The cost implications of off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery at one year.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the cost implications of the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Off or On Pump Revascularization Study (CORONARY) at 1 year.Country-specific healthcare costs were obtained from public databases or local experts from each country in the CORONARY trial. Purchasing power parities were applied to these costs of consumed healthcare resources. Analyses of subgroups included in the CORONARY clinical trial were also conducted. Costs are reported in US dollars.After 1 year, the total cost per patient in the off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) arm was $9,650 ($9,216 to $10,285) compared with $9,583 ($9,239 to $9,988) for the on-pump CABG arm; that resulted in a nonsignificant increase of $68 (-$575 to $710). Similar findings were noted for various subgroups. There were also no differences due to late conversions.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261272","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.936804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.573568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.49684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.413276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.209884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Purchasing power","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"650","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/650"},{"name":"239","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/239"},{"name":"285","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/285"},{"name":"216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216"},{"name":"988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/988"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Microarray databases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray_databases"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Purchasing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing"},{"name":"Total cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost"},{"name":"Bypass (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bypass_(road)"}]}
