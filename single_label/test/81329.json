{"id":81329,"title":"Temporoparietal fascia flap in intra-oral reconstruction without split thickness skin graft cover: a case report.","abstract":"The temporoparietal fascia flap with its long rotational axis and extensive mobilisation properties, can provide vascularised tissue to repair the most distant areas in the orofacial region. The donor site morbidity is minimal with a well-concealed scar hidden in the hair-bearing scalp. However, the temporoparietal fascia flap is usually used together with a split thickness skin graft. This leads to one more donor site causing increased morbidity. In this case temporoparietal fascia flap was used for an intra-oral reconstruction in a case of oral submucous fibrosis, without a split thickness skin graft cover. The healing was excellent and the flap provided a good surface for remucosalisation.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154162","annotations":[{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.751693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.3941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.279407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.269076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.127778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Oral submucous fibrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_submucous_fibrosis"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
