{"id":43446,"title":"Evaluation of ?2-pioglitazone, an analogue of pioglitazone, on colon cancer cell survival: Evidence of drug treatment association with autophagy and activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway.","abstract":"Thiazolidinediones have been shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects against cancer cells derived from diverse tissue origins both in vivo and in vitro. We studied the anti-proliferative impact of 5-{4-(2-(5-ethyl-pyridin-2-yl)-ethoxy)-benzylidene}-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (?2-pioglitazone), an analogue of pioglitazone, which binds to the nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-? without activating it, on human adenocarcinoma-derived HT29 and HCT116 cells. In HTC116 cells, exposure to ?2-pioglitazone reduced cell growth, but HT29 cells reached the plateau phase of growth after three days. ?2-pioglitazone treatment did not trigger cells to enter apoptosis but enhanced the autophagy process. The effect of ?2-pioglitazone treatment was related to the increase of oxygen and nitric oxide-derived species production and decreased glutathione content. Moreover, pre-treatment with an antioxidant before addition of ?2-pioglitazone limited cell growth inhibition, reduced the production of reactive species and attenuated autophagy within the cells. The impact of the drug was associated with activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway as demonstrated by the increased protein content of several antioxidant enzymes, notably heme-oxygenase-1.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788124","annotations":[{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.894125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.77716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.757526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.735704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.688678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.673576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.641531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.624663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.564819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"NFE2L2","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFE2L2"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.522301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.377896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.172595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.041581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Pioglitazone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioglitazone"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Thiazolidinedione","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazolidinedione"}]}
