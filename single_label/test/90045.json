{"id":90045,"title":"Orofacial dermal fillers: foreign body reactions, histopathologic features, and spectrometric studies.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to assess the different histopathologic presentations of dermal filler materials-induced foreign body reactions by spectrometric analyses.Sixteen cases of dermal filler foreign body reactions in the orofacial region were retrieved from the 2006-2013 period. The histologic features were evaluated and categorized into 5 groups (I to V). Unstained deparaffinized sections of representative tissue from one case in each of groups I to IV were sent for spectrometric analysis, along with samples of 2 popular dermal fillers (Juv√©derm and Radiesse).With the help of spectrometric analysis, we were able to correlate the histopathologic presentations with the specific type of dermal filler used.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656730","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.101538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.0266129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Cigar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
