{"id":91636,"title":"Vertebral fractures in motor vehicle accidents - a medical and technical analysis of 33,015 injured front-seat occupants.","abstract":"Spinal injuries pose a considerable risk to life and quality of life. In spite of improvements in active and passive safety of motor vehicles, car accidents are regarded as a major cause for vertebral fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current incidence of vertebral fractures among front-seat occupants in motor vehicle accidents, and to identify specific risk factors for sustaining vertebral fractures in motor vehicle accidents. Data from an accident research unit were accessed to collect collision details, preclinical data, and clinical data. We included all data on front-seat occupants. Hospital records were retrieved, and radiological images were evaluated. We analysed 33,015 front-seat occupants involved in motor vehicle accidents over a 24-year period. We identified 126 subjects (0.38%) with cervical spine fractures, 78 (0.24%) with thoracic fractures, and 99 (0.30%) with lumbar fractures. The mean relative collision speeds were 48, 39, and 40 kph in subjects with cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine fractures, respectively, while it was 17.3 kph in the whole cohort. Contrary to the overall cohort, these patients typically sustained multiple hits rather than simple front collisions. Occupants with vertebral fractures frequently showed numerous concomitant injuries; for example, additional vertebral fractures. The incidence of vertebral fractures corresponded with collision speed. Safety belts were highly effective in the prevention of vertebral fractures. Apart from high speed, complex injury mechanisms as multiple collisions or rollovers were associated with vertebral fractures. Additional preventive measures should focus on these collision mechanisms.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486770","annotations":[{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Motor vehicle","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.612207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.59798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.586964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.540243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.470606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.42732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.382138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Collision","weight":0.377717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.362924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Automobile safety","weight":0.351739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_safety"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.272673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.204947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.189897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.0732274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Technical analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Hit (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)"},{"name":"Geology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology"},{"name":"High-speed rail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Modern portfolio theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
