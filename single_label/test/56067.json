{"id":56067,"title":"Timolol 0.1% gel versus timolol 0.5% eyedrops in the prophylaxis of ocular hypertension after phacoemulsification surgery.","abstract":"To determine the efficacy of timolol 0.1% gel in preventing increased intraocular pressure (IOP) after uncomplicated cataract surgery.In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized study were enrolled 70 patients who underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. After cataract surgery, 25 patients received a single instillation of timolol 0.1% gel (group A); 20 a single instillation of timolol 0.5% eyedrops (group B); and 25 no treatment (group C). The IOP was measured before surgery (T0) and 5 minutes (T1), 2 hours ± 30 minutes (T2), 4 hours ± 30 minutes (T3), and 24 hours ± 180 minutes after surgery (T4).The patients in groups A and B had lower mean IOP values than those in group C at T2, T3, and T4; IOP was higher at T2 and T3 than at T1 in the control group. The IOP spikes in group C were higher than those observed in groups A and B: at T2, they were observed in 40% of the patients in group A, 30% in group B, and 76% in group C; and at T3, in respectively 20%, 10%, and 68%; and at T4, in respectively 4%, 0%, and 28%.Timolol 0.1% gel is as effective as timolol 0.5% eyedrops in reducing IOP and in limiting the occurrence of IOP spikes for up to 24 hours after phacoemulsification.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760603","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.800885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.786947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.779024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.661256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.476266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Timolol","weight":0.452697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timolol"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.362008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Ocular hypertension","weight":0.345962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_hypertension"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Kolmogorov space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_space"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Instillation abortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instillation_abortion"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 20","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_20"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"T4 (Channel 4)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T4_(Channel_4)"}]}
