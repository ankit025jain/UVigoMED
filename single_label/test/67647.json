{"id":67647,"title":"The impact of 5-alpha reductase inhibitor vs. alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists on course of prostate premalignant conditions.","abstract":"Prostate intraepithelial neoplasm and atypical small acinar proliferation are considered prostate premalignant conditions. Such a diagnosis impacts further follow-up significantly as early detection of prostate cancer is of utmost importance. alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (i.e. doxazosiunum) and inhibitors of 5-alpha reductase (Finasteride) showed some efficacy in prevention of prostate cancer development.To assess the impact of both above mentioned drugs on prostate premalignant conditions.From January 2008 till September 2012, 213 patients with one of the above mentioned premalignant condition were retrospectively evaluated. after diagnosis they were assigned to group 1 (n-126)- treated with Finasteride or to group 2 (n-87)-treated with doxazosinum. every 6-7 months rebiopsies were conducted in each patient. Rate of remission and progression was assessed.In comparison between group 1 and 2 the rate of remission was 35.7% (n-45) vs. 18.4% (n-16) (p = 0.005). In terms of progression, the difference between 1st and 2nd group of patients was 7.1% (n-9) vs. 5.7% (n-5) (p = 0.68).Remission of prostate premalignant condition is efficacious with Finasteride and not with doxazosinum. However, in terms of progression there were no differences among both drugs.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596007","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Finasteride","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finasteride"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.763603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.642679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.541721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.215792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Acinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinus"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Nd (digraph)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nd_(digraph)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"}]}
