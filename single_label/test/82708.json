{"id":82708,"title":"Postendodontic restoration: a survey among dentists in Switzerland.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the present opinions and the knowledge of Swiss general dentists about current strategies to restore endodontically treated teeth. Between 2009 and 2011, a 17-item questionnaire was given to 95 general dentists at the beginning of continuing education courses related to this topic. The majority of dentists indicated that they restore more than 30 endodontically treated teeth per year. The decision for placing an intracanal post was mainly based on the amount of remaining tooth substance and the type of tooth (anterior tooth, premolar, molar, or abutment for fixed dental prostheses). Most respondents strove for a retention depth of at least two-thirds of the root length and a form-congruent fit between post and post space preparation. In terms of post type, metallic posts were predominantely used, while an increasing application of glass-fiber posts was registered. Regardless of the type of post, composite cements were the most commonly used luting materials. The prevailing strategies for the restoration of endodontically treated teeth are in part in accordance with the current literature. Disagreements with the literature are related to the post length, the desired post fit and the fact that metal screw posts are apparently still in use.
