{"id":1264,"title":"[Studying of sclerosing action of the foam form of polidokanol in experiment in vivo].","abstract":"The results of investigation on impact of the foam form of sclerosant in experiment on 80 mongrel white rats, were presented. Sclerosing action of 0.5%, 2%, 3% solution of polydocanol in a microfoam form was studied after its infusion into lateral caudal vein of the rat. Quantity of preparation 0,5 cm3 was determined in accordance to the vein volume. Clinical and macroscopic estimation of the preparation action on internal organs and caudal rat's vein was conducted on the 10th min, every day during 1 week and on the 30th day. When the foam form of sclerosant is introduced intravenously there was not observed thrombotic complications of posterior vena cava and specific macroscopic changes in internal organs, not depending from its concentration, what witnesses security of the method, and selection of the sclerosant solution concentration must depend on the vessel diameter.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417296","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.637209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.191487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.165441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Microfoam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfoam"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Caudal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudal"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"},{"name":"Fancy rat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_rat"},{"name":"Foam","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"}]}
