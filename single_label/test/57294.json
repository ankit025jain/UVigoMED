{"id":57294,"title":"Correlation between women's sub-health and reproductive diseases with pregnancies and labors.","abstract":"To investigate whether female sub-health conditions and reproductive diseases are associated with pregnancies and labors.A cross-sectional survey was performed by using a structured questionnaire. A total of 1343 women aged 35 years or younger in six urban areas of Chengdu were included in the study. According to the Screening Criteria of sub-health conditions, these women were categorized into three groups: postpartum healthy group, sub-healthy group, and reproductive disease group. Data were double-entered using EpiData and then analyzed by SPSS.Pregnancy and labor were correlated with postpartum sub-health conditions. The number of pregnancies was negatively correlated with women's postnatal health but was positively correlated with the incidence of postpartum reproductive diseases.The number of pregnancies and labors is probably an important factor leading to sub-health conditions and the occurrence of reproductive diseases in women. Avoiding or reducing unwanted pregnancies and labors, enhancing the awareness of health among childbearing-age women are effective measures for preventing sub-health conditions.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25185366","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.679028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.62135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Teenage pregnancy","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chengdu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"1343","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1343"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
