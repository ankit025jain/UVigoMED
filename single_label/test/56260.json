{"id":56260,"title":"[Long-term follow-up after deep sclerectomy].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of deep sclerectomy (DS) with a follow-up of up to 8 years.All patients who underwent a deep sclerectomy between February 2004 and October 2005 and who attended a follow-up visit between August 2009 and October 2011 were included in this study.This study evaluated 74 eyes of 65 patients with a mean postoperative follow-up of 76.28 ± 10.6 (53.65-92.02) months. Preoperative IOP was 18.37 ± 6.36 mmHg, postoperative IOP at the last follow-up was 12.85 ± 3.5 mmHg, corresponding a 30 % reduction. The number of IOP-lowering eye drops was reduced from 2.36 ± 1.24 to 1.66 ± 1.21 after more than 6 years (p < 0.05). The visual fields showed a mean deviation of - 9.16 ± 8.48 dB initially and - 9.43 ± 8.07 dB at the last follow-up (p > 0.05). Complete success (IOP ? 15 mmHg without eye drops or additional surgery) was achieved in 5 % of patients. Qualified success (IOP ? 15 mmHg with eye drops or additional surgery) was achieved in 81 %. 53 % (n = 39) underwent cyclophotocoagulation and 20 % (n = 15) needed revision surgery during the follow-up period.DS is an effective long-term IOP-lowering procedure leading to visual field stabilisation.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715409","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.240802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.194327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.146504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0768393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Absolute deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_deviation"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Nintendo DS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Bihar Legislative Assembly election, October 2005","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_October_2005"}]}
