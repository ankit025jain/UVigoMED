{"id":55520,"title":"[Life expectancy of patients with primary glaucoma, residents of a large industrial city of Siberia].","abstract":"To investigate life expectancy and the structure of causes of death in patients with primary glaucoma, residents of a large industrial city of Siberia.The database of the Novokuznetsk Public Health Department information analysis center on registration forms 025 (outpatients) and 066 (inpatients) for 2004-2011 was analyzed.A total of 5424 primary glaucoma patients were registered during 2004-2011, of whom 441 (8.1%) subsequently died. Age at death of patients with primary glaucoma was 69.0 +/- 7.2 years. The difference between age at death and at diagnosis of glaucoma was 2.6 +/- 1.8 years.The correlation suggests that primary glaucoma is a predicting factor for vascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. The authors assume that topical administration of beta blockers without consulting a physician and/or a cardiologist may lead to ischemic stroke.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864497","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.736569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.705938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.632235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.550426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.426629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Siberia","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.33047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.257271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.150838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.135704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Beta decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Beta blocker","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"},{"name":"Health department","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department"}]}
