{"id":17549,"title":"[Actual diagnosis, treatment and prevention of human granulocytic anaplasmosis].","abstract":"Ixodes ricinus tick is widely known as a reservoir and vector for many dangerous pathogens. One of them is gram-negative bacteria called Anaplasma phagocytophilum, that may cause human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly called granulocytic ehrlichiosis). Development of modem diagnostics, which allows the implementation of effective pharmacotherapy, caused that this disease can be effectively detected only for last couple years. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis in most cases is not a severe ailment, but in some patients, especially improperly diagnosed and treated, it can lead to serious complications or even death. Due to non-specific clinical symptoms and a small number of laboratories proceeding specialized tests, human granulocytic anaplasmosis constitutes clinical and diagnostic problem. A significant increase in tick-borne diseases needs to increase public and physicians awareness of these issues.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868903","annotations":[{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.763008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.709729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.627802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.596471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.57921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Tick-borne disease","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Anaplasma phagocytophilum","weight":0.0961346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasma_phagocytophilum"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Ixodes ricinus","weight":0.0561906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_ricinus"},{"name":"Ehrlichiosis","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrlichiosis"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Ixodes","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes"},{"name":"Anaplasmosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasmosis"},{"name":"Anaplasma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasma"},{"name":"Human granulocytic anaplasmosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_granulocytic_anaplasmosis"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
