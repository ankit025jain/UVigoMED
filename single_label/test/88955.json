{"id":88955,"title":"Correction of aftereffects of ionizing radiation by exposure to low-intensity light.","abstract":"Specific features of free radical oxidation were studied after experimental exposure to ionizing radiation. A decrease in the level of products of oxidative modification of proteins and LPO was observed after exposure of irradiated zone to low-intensity incoherent red light. It was suggested that low-intensity radiation of this spectrum produces a radioprotective effect and can be used for the correction of ionizing radiation-induced disturbances.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770753","annotations":[{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.877245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.847151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.658002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"London Philharmonic Orchestra","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra"},{"name":"H-alpha","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"}]}
