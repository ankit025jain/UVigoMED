{"id":28731,"title":"Meconium indicators of maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy and association with patient characteristics.","abstract":"Identification of women with moderate alcohol abuse during pregnancy is difficult. We correlated self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy and patient characteristics with objective alcohol indicators measured in fetal meconium.A total of 557 women singleton births and available psychological tests, obstetric data and meconium samples were included in statistical analysis. Alcohol metabolites (fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG)), were determined from meconium and correlated with patient characteristics.We found that 21.2% of the 557 participants admitted low-to-moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Of the parameters analyzed from meconium, only EtG showed an association with alcohol history (P < 0.01). This association was inverse in cases with EtG value above 120?ng/g. These values indicate women with most severe alcohol consumption, who obviously denied having consumed alcohol during pregnancy. No other associations between socioeconomic or psychological characteristics and the drinking status (via meconium alcohol metabolites) could be found.Women who drink higher doses of ethanol during pregnancy, according to metabolite measures in meconium, might be less likely to admit alcohol consumption. No profile of socioeconomic or psychological characteristics of those women positively tested via meconium could be established.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800249","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.828404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.508867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.473715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Meconium","weight":0.261645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meconium"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Glucuronide","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.105721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Ethyl group","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_group"},{"name":"Long-term effects of alcohol","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
