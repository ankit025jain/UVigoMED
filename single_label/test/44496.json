{"id":44496,"title":"Clinicopathologic significance of nuclear factor-?B and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in advanced gastric cancer patients.","abstract":"Nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are involved in cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The principal objective of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of NF-?B and VEGF expression in gastric cancer.Tumor tissues of 154 patients with gastric cancer, all of whom underwent potentially curative resection, were immunohistochemically evaluated using monoclonal antibodies against NF-?B and VEGF.The positivity rates of NF-?B and VEGF staining were 44.2% and 39.6%, respectively. NF-?B expression in tumor tissues was significantly correlated with VEGF expression (p < 0.001). VEGF expression was related to Lauren's classification (p = 0.002), differentiation (p = 0.043), depth of invasion (p = 0.005), carcinoembryonic antigen expression (p = 0.032), and stage (p = 0.026). Univariate analysis demonstrated that NF-?B expression was significantly related to both the 5-year disease-free survival (65.2% vs. 46.4%, p = 0.007) and the 5-year overall survival (60.0% vs. 42.5%, p = 0.014). Multivariate analysis verified that NF-?B was independently associated with disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 2.082, p = 0.005) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.841, p = 0.008).NF-?B expression in tumor tissue is associated with poor survival in gastric cancer patients.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732642","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.736829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.679368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.620407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.605656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
