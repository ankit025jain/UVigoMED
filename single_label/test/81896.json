{"id":81896,"title":"Tai Chi exercise increases SOD activity and total antioxidant status in saliva and is linked to an improvement of periodontal disease in the elderly.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Tai Chi on biological markers of oxidative stress in saliva and its relationship with periodontal disease (PD) in older adults. We carried out a quasi-experimental study with a sample of 71 sedentary volunteers with PD who were divided into a control group of 34 subjects and an experimental group of 37 subjects who performed Tai Chi 5 days a week for a period of 6 months. PD status was characterized using the Periodontal Disease Index (PDI). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant status (TAS), and TBARS levels of both groups were measured by spectrophotometric methods. In addition, inflammation markers (TNF-?, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) were measured by flow cytometry. We found a statistically significant increase in SOD activity (P < 0.001) and TAS concentration (P < 0.05), whereas levels of IL-1? were significantly lower (P < 0.01). Likewise, a statistically significant decrease in the PDI (P < 0.05) was observed in subjects who performed Tai Chi during a period of 6 months. Our findings suggest that the practice of Tai Chi has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that are linked to the improvement of PD in older adults.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24790703","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.63229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.618999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.543164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.449282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.423525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Tai chi chuan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi_chuan"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
