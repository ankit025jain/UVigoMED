{"id":11592,"title":"Pten loss induces autocrine FGF signaling to promote skin tumorigenesis.","abstract":"Inactivation of the Pten tumor suppressor negatively regulates the PI3K-mTOR pathway. In a model of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we demonstrate that deletion of Pten strongly elevates Fgf10 protein levels without increasing Fgf10 transcription in vitro and in vivo. The translational activation of Fgf10 by Pten deletion is reversed by genetic disruption of the mTORC1 complex, which also prevents skin tumorigenesis in Pten mutants. We further show that ectopic expression of Fgf10 causes skin papillomas, whereas Pten deletion-induced skin tumors are inhibited by epidermal deletion of Fgfr2. Collectively, our data identify autocrine activation of FGF signaling as an essential mechanism in promoting Pten-deficient skin tumors.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582960","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Autocrine signalling","weight":0.863479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.625251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.620087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.580135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.557442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.53219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.417218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Ectopic expression","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_expression"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.331047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.251096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.213135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
