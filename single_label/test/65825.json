{"id":65825,"title":"[Positional changes of the magistral blood flow of the left kidney in men with varicocele and infertility].","abstract":"This paper proves the correlation between characteristics of blood flow rate in the renal veins and resistance indices of the renal arteries. As a result of polypositional assessment of venous blood flow, it was found that the violations of magistral venous blood flow in the left kidney can affect the formation and progression of varicocele, and the severity of disorders of spermatogenesis. The necessity of assessment of testicular veins and the pressure in left renal vein not only in clin- and orthostasis or Valsalva maneuver, but in the six static positions is discussed; this can allow to register the violations of magistral renal blood flow at the early stages important for fertility disorders, improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of patients with varicocele.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772771","annotations":[{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.886777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Orthostatic hypotension","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension"},{"name":"Spermatogenesis","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogenesis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal vein","weight":0.666708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_vein"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.380405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Renal blood flow","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_blood_flow"}]}
