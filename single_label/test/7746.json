{"id":7746,"title":"In vivo rat model to study horizontal tumor progression.","abstract":"Most cancer deaths are due to metastases. Metastasis is an extraordinarily complex process by which cancer cells complete a sequential series of steps before they transform into a clinically detectable lesion. These steps typically include separation from the primary tumor, invasion through surrounding tissues and basement membranes, entry and survival in the circulation, lymphatic or peritoneal space, and arrest in a distant target organ and the formation of secondary tumors in distant organs.While proposed or accepted models and mechanisms of metastatic progression, have been demonstrated in experimental systems, none of them sufficiently explain all of the complexities associated with this process. These models can broadly be classified into two types, those occurring by vertical gene transfer (Darwinian) and those involving horizontal or lateral DNA transfer. Here, we describe an experimental system to study the metastatic process involving the horizontal transfer of circulating DNA.
