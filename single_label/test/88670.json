{"id":88670,"title":"Pseudarthrosis of the clavicle.","abstract":"A 21-year-old active duty soldier presented with right shoulder pain and prominence over his right clavicle, with no history of trauma. He recalled that the deformity had been present for a long time, but only recently became painful. The onset of shoulder pain coincided with the beginning of his military service and the requirement to wear over-the-shoulder equipment such as back packs and load-bearing equipment. Physical examination revealed a prominence over the right midshaft clavicle with tenderness to palpation, full active range of motion of the shoulder, and that he was neurovascularly intact.
