{"id":76881,"title":"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: a transient ischaemic attack mimic.","abstract":"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a commonly occurring condition that is not familiar to most clinicians. A common presenting feature may be transient focal neurological symptoms leading to the potential for clinical misdiagnosis as transient ischaemic attack. This may result in the inappropriate use of anti-platelets and anticoagulants or radiological misdiagnosis. It is also being increasingly recognised as an important cause of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage and cognitive impairment in the elderly. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can be diagnosed based on clinical and radiological findings, but clinicians need a high index of suspicion to ensure appropriate investigations are requested. In this article we aim to cover the pathophysiology, clinical findings, radiological appearances and approach to management of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
