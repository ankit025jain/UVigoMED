{"id":571,"title":"Engaging minorities in researching sensitive health topics by using a participatory approach.","abstract":"To report the use of a community participatory approach (PA) in a project investigating tuberculosis (TB) in UK Somali migrants.It is crucial to address health inequalities and persistent health problems, particularly in groups who are often excluded or seem hard to reach. TB is an illness stigmatised in the Somali population, making it a difficult topic for research. In this study, a community PA was used to investigate TB and members of the Somali community were recruited as co-researchers.Four community researchers (CRs), eight focus groups (n=48), interviews with members of the community (n=24), people with TB and ex-TB patients (n=14), and healthcare practitioners (n=18).This is an informative paper. Discussion The paper describes the approach used in the recruitment of community researchers and how engaging early with community leaders using oral communication made it possible to research TB in the Somali community.The PA led to capacity building, trust and a longer sustainable partnership with members of the Somali community. The success of the approach in the study suggests that there are valuable lessons for those researching similar topics with minority groups.Involving people in health research topics with a stigma is possible. This paper highlights how this could be achieved using a community PA and the recruitment of community members as co-researchers. However, the PA is time-consuming and will depend on the skills of academic researchers in knowing and engaging with the community.","date":"2014-11-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25423942","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.672517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.591077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.56142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.515743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.497399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Capacity building","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_building"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"Somali people","weight":0.100451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_people"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Trust law","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Participation (decision making)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_(decision_making)"}]}
