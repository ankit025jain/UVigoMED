{"id":68539,"title":"Diagnostic and prognostic scoring system for prostate cancer using urine and plasma biomarkers.","abstract":"To avoid relying solely on serum prostate-specific antigen (sPSA) in screening for prostate cancer (PCa), we developed a scoring system for detecting PCa and the prediction of aggressiveness. We analyzed urine and plasma specimens from 121 patients with PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for the levels of UAP1, PDLIM5, IMPDH2, HSPD1, PCA3, PSA, TMPRSS2, ERG, GAPDH, and B2M genes. Patient age, sPSA level, and polymerase chain reaction data were entered through multiple algorithms to determine models most useful for the detection of cancer and predicting aggressiveness.In the first algorithm, we distinguished PCa from BPH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] of 0.78). Another algorithm distinguished patients with the Gleason score (GS) of ?7 from GS of <7 cancer or BPH (AUROC of 0.88). By incorporating the two algorithms into a scoring system, 75% of the analyzed samples showed concordance between the two models (99% specificity and 68% sensitivity for predicting GS ?7 in this group).A scoring system incorporating two algorithms using urine and plasma biomarkers highly predicts the presence of GS ?7 PCa in 75% of patients. Our algorithms may assist with both biopsy indication and patient prognosis.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512523","annotations":[{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.882393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"TMPRSS2","weight":0.695802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPRSS2"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.543164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.459522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.246731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"ERG (gene)","weight":0.0471159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERG_(gene)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
