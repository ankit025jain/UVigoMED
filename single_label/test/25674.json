{"id":25674,"title":"Fourier analysis of peripheral blood pressure and flow in intraoperative assessment of infrainguinal arterial reconstructions.","abstract":"To assess infrainguinal arterial reconstructions by intraoperative flowmetry under the distal anastomosis using a fast Fourier transformation; calculate and compare the amplitude ratios of peripheral arterial blood pressure and volume flow before and after drug-induced vasodilation of occluded bypass grafts and bypass grafts that have been patent at least for 1 year. To find what magnitude of the change of these ratios indicate a long-term patency of the bypass grafting.We compared the results of the intraoperative flowmetry tests of 97 patients with infrainguinal arterial reconstructions. The patients were divided into two groups based on the graft status: the grafts in 49 patients were patent for at least a year, and 48 patients had failed bypass. We used a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the pressure and blood flow waves and compared the ratios of their amplitudes before and after administration of a vasodilator drug into the graft. Comparing the ratios obtained before and those after administration of the drug we quantified their change in each group and analysed them.After a drug-induced vasodilation, the blood pressure and flow amplitude ratios for the group with compromised reconstructions were less than 1.9 times smaller than those before drug infusion, while for the group with bypass grafts that had been functional for at least 12 months the ratios declined by more than 1.9 approximately 2 times.The magnitude of the change of amplitude ratios of the peripheral pressure and volume flow after drug-induced vasodilation can be used to make an assessment of the bypass graft and the distal arterial segment.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181847","annotations":[{"name":"Fourier analysis","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Fourier transform","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.418934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.417908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.4089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Fast Fourier transform","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.314041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.307549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.110465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Joseph Fourier","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Integral transform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Magnitude (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)"},{"name":"S-matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-matrix"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Bypass (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bypass_(road)"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0137002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"}]}
