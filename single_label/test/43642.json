{"id":43642,"title":"Combination of radiofrequency ablation with transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: an up-to-date meta-analysis.","abstract":"The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effectiveness of combination of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with that of RFA alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Randomized controlled trials comparing RFA plus TACE with RFA alone for HCC were included into this meta-analysis, and the search strategy followed the requirement of the Cochrane Library Handbook. Overall survival rate and recurrence-free survival rate were analyzed and compared by using Review Manager (version 5). We identified 7 randomized controlled trials comprising 571 patients who were treated by RFA plus TACE versus RFA alone for HCC. Meta-analyses showed that the combination of RFA and TACE was associated with a significantly higher overall survival rates (OR1 year?=?2.39, 95 % CI, 1.35-4.21, P?=?0.003; OR3 years?=?1.85, 95 %CI 1.26-2.71, P?=?0.002), and recurrence-free survival rate (OR1 year?=?2.00, 95 % CI 1.26-3.18, P?=?0.003; OR3 years?=?2.13, 95 %CI 1.41-3.20, P?<?0.001). Additionally, the quality of the evidence was high for the 1- and 3-year survival rate; no evidence of publication bias was observed. The combination of RFA with TACE can improve the overall survival rate and the recurrence-free survival rate for patients with HCC.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777334","annotations":[{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.591387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.559469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.537704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.425758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.285553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.233534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0261065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"354","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/354"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Royal Fleet Auxiliary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Fleet_Auxiliary"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
