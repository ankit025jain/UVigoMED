{"id":90925,"title":"Designer adiponectin receptor agonist stabilizes metabolic function and prevents brain injury caused by HIV protease inhibitors.","abstract":"HIV protease inhibitors (PI) are fundamental to combination antiretroviral therapy, which has revolutionized HIV clinical care and produced significant reductions in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. However, PI administration is frequently associated with severe metabolic impairment, including lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance; all of which can contribute to cardiovascular and neurologic co-morbidities. Experimental and epidemiological data support a potentially important role for the adipokine adiponectin in both metabolic and neurologic physiology. This study examined if ADP355, a novel, peptide-based adiponectin receptor agonist, could neutralize the detrimental effects of PI treatment in experimental animal models. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a clinically relevant, 4-week regimen of lopinavir/ritonavir, with daily injections of ADP355 administered only during the final 2 weeks of PI exposure. Comprehensive metabolic, neurobehavioral, and biochemical analyses revealed that ADP355 administration partially reversed PI-induced loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, attenuated PI-induced hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypoadiponectinemia, and prevented PI-induced cognitive impairment and brain injury. Collectively, these data reinforce the link between metabolic co-morbidities and cognitive impairment and suggest that pharmacological reactivation of adiponectin pathways could remediate key aspects of PI-induced metabolic syndrome in clinical settings. Furthermore, therapeutic targeting of adiponectin receptors could show utility in reducing the prevalence and/or severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562631","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic
