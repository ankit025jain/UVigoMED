{"id":45935,"title":"Outcomes of transcatheter arterial embolization for acute hemorrhage originating from gastric adenocarcinoma.","abstract":"To evaluate the indications, complications, and clinical outcomes of transcatheter embolization for acute hemorrhage associated with gastric adenocarcinoma.Ten patients underwent catheter-directed arterial embolization at two institutions for acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage related to pathology-proven gastric adenocarcinoma from March 2002 to March 2012. The electronic medical record for each patient was reviewed for clinical presentation, endoscopy history, procedural complications, and long-term follow-up results.Between March 2002 and March 2012, 10 patients (eight men; mean age, 61.1 y Â± 15.3) underwent transcatheter arterial embolization for gastrointestinal hemorrhage caused by gastric adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic therapy had failed in all patients before embolization. Embolization involving branches of the left gastric artery was performed in all patients. No deaths or complications related to the procedure were identified. Mean survival was 301 days, but with a wide range, from 1 day to 1,852 days and counting. Those with unresectable disease (n = 7; 70%) had a median survival time of 9 days, significantly worse (P < .01) than those with resectable disease (n = 3; 30%), who had a median survival of 792 days. Six patients, all with unresectable disease, did not live beyond 30 days. Two of the three patients with resectable disease had subsequent curative resection.Transcatheter arterial embolization can be considered for cases of acute hemorrhagic gastric adenocarcinoma, with improved outcomes in patients with localized disease compared with nonresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657087","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.805691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.746993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.706565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.634842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.632495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.521298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.467669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
