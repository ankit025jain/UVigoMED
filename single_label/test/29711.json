{"id":29711,"title":"Large-scale brain network coupling predicts acute nicotine abstinence effects on craving and cognitive function.","abstract":"Interactions of large-scale brain networks may underlie cognitive dysfunctions in psychiatric and addictive disorders.To test the hypothesis that the strength of coupling among 3 large-scale brain networks--salience, executive control, and default mode--will reflect the state of nicotine withdrawal (vs smoking satiety) and will predict abstinence-induced craving and cognitive deficits and to develop a resource allocation index (RAI) that reflects the combined strength of interactions among the 3 large-scale networks.A within-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging study in an academic medical center compared resting-state functional connectivity coherence strength after 24 hours of abstinence and after smoking satiety. We examined the relationship of abstinence-induced changes in the RAI with alterations in subjective, behavioral, and neural functions. We included 37 healthy smoking volunteers, aged 19 to 61 years, for analyses.Twenty-four hours of abstinence vs smoking satiety.Inter-network connectivity strength (primary) and the relationship with subjective, behavioral, and neural measures of nicotine withdrawal during abstinence vs smoking satiety states (secondary).The RAI was significantly lower in the abstinent compared with the smoking satiety states (left RAI, P?=?.002; right RAI, P?=?.04), suggesting weaker inhibition between the default mode and salience networks. Weaker inter-network connectivity (reduced RAI) predicted abstinence-induced cravings to smoke (r?=?-0.59; P?=?.007) and less suppression of default mode activity during performance of a subsequent working memory task (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, r?=?-0.66, P?=?.003; posterior cingulate cortex, r?=?-0.65, P?=?.001).Alterations in coupling of the salience and default mode networks and the inability to disengage from the default mode network may be critical in cognitive/affective alterations that underlie nicotine dependence.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced
