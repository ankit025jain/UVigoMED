{"id":81066,"title":"Population pharmacokinetics of azithromycin and chloroquine in healthy adults and paediatric malaria subjects following oral administration of fixed-dose azithromycin and chloroquine combination tablets.","abstract":"Population pharmacokinetics (PK) of azithromycin (AZ) and chloroquine (CQ) following administration of fixed-dose combination tablet formulations of AZ and CQ (AZCQ) was evaluated using data from two studies: 1) in children with symptomatic uncomplicated falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Africa; and 2) in healthy adults in the United States.Study 1 included paediatric subjects randomized to either AZCQ or artemether-lumefantrine treatment in Cohort 1 (age 5-12 years) and Cohort 2 (age 6-59 months). Dosing of AZCQ was approximately 30 mg/kg AZ and 10 mg/kg CQ once daily for 3 days (for ?20 kg weight: AZ/CQ 300/100 mg per tablet; 5 to <20 kg weight: AZ/CQ 150/50 mg per tablet). Study 2 included adults randomized to receive either two AZCQ tablets (AZ/CQ 250/155 mg per tablet) or individual commercial tablets of AZ 500 mg and CQ 300 mg. Serum AZ and plasma CQ concentrations from both studies were pooled. Population PK models were constructed using standard approaches to evaluate the concentration-time data for AZ and CQ and to identify any covariates predictive of PK behaviour.A three-compartment PK model with linear clearance and absorption adequately described AZ data, while a two-compartment model with linear clearance and absorption and an absorption lag adequately described CQ data. No overall bias or substantial model misspecification was evident using diagnostic plots and visual predictive checks. Body weight as an allometric function was the only covariate in the final AZ and CQ PK models. There were significantly lower AZ (0.488 vs 0.745 [mg•h/L]/[mg/kg], p?<?0.00001) and CQ (0.836 vs 1.27 [mg•h/L]/[mg/kg], p?<?0.00001) exposures (AUCinf) normalized by dose (mg/kg) in children compared with the adults.The PK of AZ and CQ following administration of AZCQ was well described using a three- and two-compartment model, respectively. AZ and CQ exhibited linear absorption and clearance; the model for CQ included an absorption lag. Weight was predictive of exposure for both AZ and CQ. Assuming equivalent dosing (mg/kg), AZ and CQ exposure in children would be expected to be lower than that in adults, suggesting that children may require a higher dose (mg/kg) than adults to achieve the same AZ and CQ exposure.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Parasitic
