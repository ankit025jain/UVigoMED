{"id":90749,"title":"Posttraumatic arthritis from gunshot injuries to the hip requiring a primary THA.","abstract":"Gunshot injuries to the hip can be devastating, leading to posttraumatic arthritis and presenting a surgical challenge at the time of total hip arthroplasty (THA) due to the presence of metallic fragments and damaged soft tissues. However, there are few reports of gunshot-related posttraumatic arthritis. The purpose of this study was to describe the features and report the early outcomes of THA in 4 patients who developed posttraumatic arthritis from gunshot injuries to their hips 2, 10, 18, and 26 years after their initial injury, respectively. All 4 patients underwent successful THA without complications. None of the patients had undergone a revision procedure at a mean 26-month (range, 12-48 months) follow-up. The authors believe that primary THA is a safe and effective procedure to reduce pain and improve function for gunshot-related posttraumatic arthritis in patients in whom nonoperative management failed.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579229","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.495937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.486612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.334482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.227124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.200243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.176395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Ballistic trauma","weight":0.165736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trauma"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"1248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1248"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Gunshot","weight":0.0150458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot"},{"name":"Historical revisionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
