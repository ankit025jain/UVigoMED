{"id":38529,"title":"Hip resurfacing arthroplasty at a non-specialist centre.","abstract":"Few studies have reported the outcome of hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) with respect to implant characteristics from non-specialist centres. We report the survival, clinical and radiological outcomes of a single surgeon series of HRA with an average follow-up duration of five years.All consecutive HRAs performed by a single surgeon between 2003 and 2011 at a district general hospital were retrospectively examined clinically and radiologically.A total of 85 patients underwent 109 HRAs (58 male [53.2%] and 51 female patients [46.8%]) with a mean follow-up period of 62 months (range: 12-102 months). The median age was 57 years (range: 25-75 years). The mean acetabular and femoral head component sizes were 54 mm (range: 48-64 mm) and 48 mm (range: 42-58 mm) respectively with a mean acetabular inclination angle of 42.9° (range: 20-75°). The survival rate was 95% with five revisions due to aseptic loosening (n=3) and fracture (n=2): these were predominantly for female patients (n=4), with significantly smaller mean acetabular (51 mm, p=0.04) and femoral (44 mm, p=0.02) implant sizes. Furthermore, they had a higher mean acetabular inclination angle of 48.1° (p=0.74). The mean Oxford hip score was 43.8 (range: 25-48) and the mean University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score was 6.8 (range: 3-10). Radiological findings included heterotopic ossification in 13 (11.9%), radiolucent lines in 6 (5.5%), femoral neck thinning in 2 (1.8%) and femoral neck notching in 5 patients (4.6%).We have shown that HRA at a non-specialist centre has short to medium-term outcomes comparable with those at specialist centres. HRA therefore remains a viable option although vigilance is required in case selection and follow-up according to national guidance.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and
