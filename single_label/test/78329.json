{"id":78329,"title":"Clinical features, presenting symptoms, and surgical results of congenital cholesteatoma based on Potsic's staging system.","abstract":"Potsic's staging system is a clinically useful procedure for evaluating the extent of congenital cholesteatoma (CC).We investigated the clinical features, presenting symptoms, and surgical results of CC according to Potsic's staging system.A total of 71 patients who had undergone surgery at our hospital were retrospectively analyzed for presenting symptoms, the location of cholesteatoma, and surgical results according to Potsic's staging system.Of the 71 patients, 21 were classified as Potsic stage I, 9 as stage II, 31 as stage III, and 10 as stage IV. More than half of the patients with early-stage CC (stages I and II) were diagnosed asymptomatically by a chance visit to a clinic or on ear screening. Others were diagnosed following a complaint of hearing loss, acute otitis media, or otitis media with effusion. The location of CC varied somewhat by stage. In stage I CC, the most frequent location was behind the anterior-superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane; however, in stage III CC, it was behind the posterior-superior quadrant. All patients were treated surgically. Recurrence was detected in 2 of the 71 patients (2.8%); both had stage II CC. Recurrent lesions were removed during revision surgery.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702226","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.726325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.621664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.539853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.307358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.268056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0762492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0757289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Tensor tympani muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Complaint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
