{"id":9369,"title":"Optimized nested polymerase chain reaction for antemortem detection of Mycobacteria in Amazon parrots (Amazona aestiva) and orange-winged Amazons (Amazona amazonica).","abstract":"The objectives of this study were to optimize nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and apply them on samples from parrots. Results were negative for the presence of these Mycobacterium in the samples, and nested PCR was specific, faster, and more sensitive than other tests, thereby justifying its use in antemortem diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712177","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.88416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.693741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.646329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Mycobacterium avium complex","weight":0.633716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_avium_complex"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Amazons","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_complex"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Amazon parrot","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_parrot"},{"name":"Blue-fronted Amazon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-fronted_Amazon"},{"name":"Orange-winged Amazon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange-winged_Amazon"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Amazon River","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River"},{"name":"Parrot","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot"}]}
