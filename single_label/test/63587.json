{"id":63587,"title":"Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (cocoon bowel) presenting after laparotomy for splenic abscess.","abstract":"Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis, previously referred to as cocoon bowel, is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction that often results in obstruction due to the development of a fibrous enhancing membrane that encases multiple small bowel loops. We present a case of a patient who presented to our institution with abdominal distension and guarding. Computed tomography was obtained which revealed findings concerning for sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Sonographic imaging was also obtained and provides correlative imaging.
