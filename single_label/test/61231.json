{"id":61231,"title":"Use of CD137 ligand expression in the detection of small B-cell lymphomas involving the bone marrow.","abstract":"Staging for small B-cell lymphomas is important for prognostic and therapeutic decision making; however, the detection of lymphoid infiltrates in the bone marrow is often hampered by the lack of specific diagnostic markers. We recently described the hematopoietic tissue distribution patterns of CD137 and CD137 ligand (CD137L), which have shown promise as immunotherapeutic targets. CD137 expression was primarily confined to cells in the microenvironment, whereas CD137L was expressed in neoplastic cells in most B-cell lymphomas. Here we evaluate the use of CD137L in the detection of small B-cell lymphomas involving the bone marrow. To test the potential efficacy of CD137L in detecting bone marrow lymphoid infiltrates, 166 small B-cell lymphomas were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and double-immunofluorescence labeling on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsies. CD137L was highly expressed in bone marrows involved by small B-cell lymphomas and included hairy cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, B-lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, a small subset of marginal zone lymphoma and most of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma showed staining. Normal bone marrow cells including myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors, and reactive lymphoid aggregates lacked staining. Our findings show that immunohistochemistry for CD137L is capable of reliably distinguishing small B-cell lymphomas from reactive lymphoid aggregates. These data also suggest that CD137L is useful in providing staging information for clinical diagnosis and is likely to furnish a potential target for minimal residual disease assessment as well as immunotherapy in patients with stage 4 disease.
