{"id":52472,"title":"Serum inhibin A and inhibin B levels in epithelial ovarian cancer patients.","abstract":"of our study was to examine serum inhibin A and inhibin B concentrations in ovarian cancer patients in relation to clinicopathological features and 5-year survival.We enrolled 90 epithelial ovarian cancer patients in our study, aged 45-81 years, who underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery. In all patients, serum inhibin A and inhibin B concentrations were measured using a two-step sandwich type enzyme immunoassay before surgery.In the group of patients with ovarian cancer median serum concentration of inhibin A was 3.87 pg/mL (0.96-10.09) and inhibin B was 13.9 pg/mL (5.1-45.0). Median concentrations of inhibin A and B in relation to FIGO stage and histological subtype did not differ significantly. Inhibin A levels were significantly higher in patients with lower grading (G1 and G2) in comparison to those with higher grade G3 (p=0.001). There were no differences in inhibin B concentrations in relation to grading. The Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated no differences in survival rate in relation to inhibin A levels, while there was a stepwise impairment of 5-years survival with increased inhibin B level. In the group of patients with inhibin B levels higher than 20 pg/ml the survival rate was lower (p=0,00625, log-rank test).1. Higher inhibin A serum levels were found in patients with highly differentiated ovarian carcinoma compared to the group of patients with a poorly differentiated cancer, which may confirm the influence of inhibin A on cell proliferation processes. 2. A significant importance of inhibin B was demonstrated in the prediction of death within less than a five year period. The probability of survival in patients featuring high inhibin B levels was lower with statistical significance. This may indicate the need for further studies on how to block the inhibin B activation pathway in the ovarian carcinoma therapy.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599287","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.814343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.79758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.687357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.661366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.613322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.591951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Activin and inhibin","weight":0.354468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activin_and_inhibin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.256931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.208501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"GCE Advanced Level","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
