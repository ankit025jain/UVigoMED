{"id":84284,"title":"Group visits for chronic illness management: implementation challenges and recommendations.","abstract":"The group visit approach to improve chronic illness self-management appears promising in terms of selected outcomes, but little information is available about best ways to organize and implement group visits. This literature review of 84 articles identified group visit implementation challenges, including lack of a group visit billing code, inadequate administrative support and resources, difficult participant recruitment and retention, and logistical issues such as space and scheduling. Recommendations for future implementation initiatives were also abstracted from the literature. Patients and providers can benefit from well-planned and well-conducted group visits. These benefits include greater patient and provider satisfaction, reduced overall utilization, improved clinical outcomes, and greater provider efficiency and productivity.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137809","annotations":[{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.527604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.321976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Tariff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Source code","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"}]}
