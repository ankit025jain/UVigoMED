{"id":77417,"title":"[Post-occupational medical follow-up: stakes, terms, obstacles].","abstract":"The number of new cancers attributable to occupational exposure each year in France is estimated to be 20000, and about 25% of retired men have been occupationally exposed to asbestos, and 8% to wood dust. Since 1995, a post-occupational medical follow-up exists for people, inactive, unemployed or (pre-) retired, who during their employment were exposed to some pneumoconiosis-causing agents and/or carcinogens occupational. This system is little known and underused. The obstacles to this follow-up are multiple and complex. The main is the lack of information of the various participants in the process (employees, former employees, physicians, employers) but the outlook is optimistic. Strengthening ties between generalist practitioners and occupational physicians are needed to improve the efficiency of post-occupational medical follow-up.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851374","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.658923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.514344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.50986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"France","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Asbestos","weight":0.489707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.489074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Wood","weight":0.417603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.187786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Optimism","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Gambling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"}]}
