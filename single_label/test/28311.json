{"id":28311,"title":"Discrimination and substance use disorders among Latinos: the role of gender, nativity, and ethnicity.","abstract":"We examined the relationship between discrimination and substance use disorders among a diverse sample of Latinos. We also investigated whether the relationship between discrimination and substance use disorders varied by gender, nativity, and ethnicity.Our analyses focused on 6294 Latinos who participated in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions from 2004 to 2005. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine the association between discrimination and substance use disorders.Discrimination was significantly associated with increased odds of alcohol and drug use disorders among Latinos. However, the relationship between discrimination and substance use disorders varied by gender, nativity, and ethnicity. Discrimination was associated with increased odds of alcohol and drug use disorders for certain groups, such as women, US-born Latinos, and Mexicans, but this relationship did not follow the same pattern for other subgroups.It is important to determine which subgroups among Latinos may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of discrimination to address their needs.","date":"2014-07-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922159","annotations":[{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.678432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.543623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.265635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Hispanic and Latino Americans","weight":0.239253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.228847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Nativity of Jesus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativity_of_Jesus"},{"name":"Igbo people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Multinomial distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution"},{"name":"Related","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
