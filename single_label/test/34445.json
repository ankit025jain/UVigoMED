{"id":34445,"title":"Screening for deep vein thrombosis after periacetabular osteotomy in adult patients: is it necessary?","abstract":"The periacetabular osteotomy has become a common procedure for treating symptomatic acetabular dysplasia. Like other major hip procedures, there is concern regarding the risk of associated venous thromboembolic disease. Nevertheless, there is limited information regarding the need for screening, and optimal prophylactic measures have not been established.We sought to determine the frequency of thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and symptomatic pulmonary embolism [PE]) associated with the periacetabular osteotomy in in patients receiving aspirin and mechanical compression prophylaxis.We performed a retrospective review of 134 adult patients (149 hips) treated with the periacetabular osteotomy during an 8-year period. During this period, 136 (91%) of the hips treated with a periacetabular osteotomy were screened within 1 week for DVT, whereas 13 (9%) could not be evaluated for various reasons. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 30 years (range, 18-60 years), and no patients were lost to followup during the 4 to 6 months after surgery. The same thromboembolic prophylactic regimen was used for all patients. This consisted of 325 mg aspirin twice a day and compression stockings for 6 weeks and lower extremity pneumatic compression devices while hospitalized. Screening bilateral lower extremity ultrasonography was performed within 1 week (mean, 4 days) of the procedure to detect asymptomatic DVTs.Of the 134 patients, two patients (two hips) with negative postoperative screening ultrasounds presented at 14 and 38 days postoperatively with clinical symptoms of DVT. Repeat ultrasound confirmed this diagnosis in both cases. There were no symptoms of PE. Screening venous ultrasonography did not identify any DVTs during the early postoperative period before discharge. These two patients were treated with 3 to 6 months of warfarin anticoagulation. Neither patient had persistent symptoms related to the DVT.These data indicate that the risk of symptomatic DVT associated with periacetabular osteotomy is low (1%) with use of aspirin and mechanical compression prophylaxis. Furthermore, routine postoperative screening did not detect any patients with an asymptomatic DVT.Level IV, therapeutic study.
