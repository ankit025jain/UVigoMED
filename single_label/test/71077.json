{"id":71077,"title":"General health status and late effects among adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer in Japan.","abstract":"We sought to investigate general health status and late effects among adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer.We conducted a cross-sectional survey, using self-rated questionnaires on current and past health problems. Questionnaires were provided to childhood cancer survivors, a comparison group of siblings and a general population control group that was recruited online. ?(2) tests were used to compare responses to the 72 survey items.The final sample included 185 childhood cancer survivors (72% response rate), 72 siblings and 1000 general population controls. In the childhood cancer survivors group, the median age of diagnosis was 8 years and the median age at survey was 23 years. According to the physicians' reports, 56% of the childhood cancer survivors experienced at least one late effect. In descending order of prevalence, the current symptoms in the childhood cancer survivors group were (i) impaired visual acuity (45%), (ii) dizziness (36%) and (iii) any allergy (34%). The three most common symptoms had similar prevalence rates in each of the groups. As compared with the control group, the following physical symptoms were significantly more common in the childhood cancer survivors group: mental retardation (odds ratio: 48.6, P < 0.01); cataract (odds ratio: 29.7); suspected infertility (odds ratio: 25.1); delayed puberty (odds ratio 24.9); growth hormone deficiency (odds ratio: 23.0); and other audiovisual, urinary, endocrine, infertility, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, spinal, extremity and neuromuscular problems.Many adolescent/young adult childhood cancer survivors could be suffering from ongoing late effects that stem from cancer and its treatment. Overall health monitoring for childhood cancer survivors can provide indispensable benefits.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108030","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Growth
