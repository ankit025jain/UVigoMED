{"id":85748,"title":"Emergency endovascular management of pulmonary artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms for the treatment of massive haemoptysis.","abstract":"In this study we report the results of endovascular techniques for the management of pulmonary artery aneurysms (PAA) and pseudoaneurysms (PAPS).Cases with massive haemoptysis due to PAA and/or PAPS that were managed by endovascular means were included in the study. Clinical history and procedure details were analysed. Primary endpoints were immediate technical success and re-intervention rate; secondary endpoints were survival rate and relapse of bleeding.Among the 72 patients with massive haemoptysis who were treated in our department during an 8-year period, 6 patients with 6 lesions (2 PAA, 4 PAPS) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The mean age was 46.5 years; mean lesion diameter was 12.7 mm (range 4-22 mm); underlying pathologies were vasculitis (n=2), erosion by necrotic tumour (n=1), previous lung surgery (n=1) and infectious disease (n=2). Four lesions were treated with coils, 1 with coils and a bare stent, and 1 with a covered stent. The technical success was 100%. Mean follow-up was 20.4 months. The re-intervention rate was 50%, but in only 16.6% was it related to the treated lesions. Survival rate was 66.6%. There were no major or minor complications.Endovascular management offers a safe and effective solution for the emergency treatment of massive haemoptysis due to PAA and PAPS. A variety of endovascular devices may be used, according to the size and the anatomical location of the lesion.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862612","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.844919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.727826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
