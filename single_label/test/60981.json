{"id":60981,"title":"[Successful double-lumen tube insertion using Pentax-AWS Airwayscope with an infant-sized intlock in a rheumatoid arthritis patient with restricted mouth opening and head tilting].","abstract":"Successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tube was achieved using Pentax-AWS Airwayscope (AWS) with an infant-size Intlock in a patient with restricted mouth opening and head tilting. A 78-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was scheduled for extended thymectomy under general anesthesia, with anticipated difficult airway. Sufficient mask ventilation with the jaw-thrust maneuver was achieved. The laryngoscopic view was defined as grade III (Cormack & Lehane's classification)with Macintosh laryngoscope. The AWS with an infant-size Intlock facilitated visualization of the glottis, leading to a successful placement of a 32-Fr double-lumen tube under the guidance of the AWS image. Double-lumen tube insertion assisted by the AWS with an infant-size Intlock may be useful for difficult airway management in patients with restricted mouth opening and head tilting.","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783604","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.905912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.77631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Airway management","weight":0.774857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_management"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.722519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.638424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.614802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.50925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.232721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Thymectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymectomy"},{"name":"Macintosh","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Tympanostomy tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanostomy_tube"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tilting train","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilting_train"},{"name":"Cormack, Newfoundland and Labrador","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormack,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador"}]}
