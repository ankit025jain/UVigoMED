{"id":2755,"title":"Differential expression and function of survivin during the progress of pterygium.","abstract":"To investigate the expression pattern and function of survivin in the development of pterygium.Primary pterygia at quiescent or advanced clinical stage and normal human conjunctival tissues were used in this study. Pterygium epithelial cells (PECs) were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free defined medium and harvested at different growth stages. Tissue sections and cultured cells were detected with survivin, phosphorylated survivin (Thr43), p63, p57, and p21 on protein, and/or mRNA level. Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay was performed to measure proliferation status of primary cultured PECs. Small interfering (si) RNA specific for survivin was transfected on PECs at subconfluence stage.Survivin was highly expressed in all pterygium tissues, but not in normal human conjunctiva, at mRNA and protein levels. It was mainly present in the epithelial cytoplasm of pterygium at quiescent stage, while present in the nucleus of pterygium at advanced stage. Phosphorylated survivin was upregulated in pterygium at advanced stage. Pterygium epithelial cells cultured under subconfluence stage showed higher expression of survivin and p63, but lower expression of p57 and p21, compared with PECs reached confluence. Both total and phosphorylated survivin was mainly expressed in the nuclei of PECs under subconfluence, and there was cytoplasmic translocation of survivin when PECs reached confluence. The knockdown of survivin by siRNA inhibited proliferation of PECs, accompanied by downregulation of p63, and upregulation of p57 and p21.Higher subcellular expression and phosphorylation of survivin may play roles in the development of pterygium. Survivin could be targeted for the treatment of pterygium.","date":"2014-12-30","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25468890","annotations":[{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.737043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.716565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.589967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.549819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.443158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.440061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C","weight":0.429552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase_inhibitor_1C"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.301356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.244691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"G0 phase","weight":0.215536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0_phase"},{"name":"Ontogeny","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
