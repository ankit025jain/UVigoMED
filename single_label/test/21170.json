{"id":21170,"title":"GSK3? and the control of infectious bacterial diseases.","abstract":"Glycogen synthase kinase 3? (GSK3?) has been shown to be a crucial mediator of the intensity and direction of the innate immune system response to bacterial stimuli. This review focuses on: (i) the central role of GSK3? in the regulation of pathogen-induced inflammatory responses through the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, (ii) the extensive ongoing efforts to exploit GSK3? for its therapeutic potential in the control of infectious diseases, and (iii) the increasing evidence that specific pathogens target GSK3?-related pathways for immune evasion. A better understanding of complex bacteria-GSK3? interactions is likely to lead to more effective anti-inflammatory interventions and novel targets to circumvent pathogen colonization and survival.
