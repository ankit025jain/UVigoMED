{"id":83801,"title":"A novel wheat-Dasypyrum breviaristatum substitution line with stripe rust resistance.","abstract":"The introduction of genetic variation from wild and cultivated Triticeae species has been a long-standing approach for wheat improvement. Dasypyrum breviaristatum species harbor novel and agronomically important genes for resistance against multi-fungal diseases. The development of new wheat-D. breviaristatum introgression lines offers chances for the identification of stripe rust resistance gene(s). A wheat line, D11-5, was selected from a cross between wheat line MY11 and wheat-D. breviaristatum partial amphiploid TDH-2. It was characterized by FISH and PCR-based molecular markers. Chromosome counting revealed that the D11-5 line shows a hexaploid set of 2n = 6x = 42 chromosomes. FISH analysis using the Dasypyrum repetitive sequence pDb12H as a probe demonstrated that D11-5 contained a pair of D. breviaristatum chromosomes, while FISH with wheat D-genomic repetitive sequences revealed that the chromosome 2D was absent in D11-5. The functional molecular markers confirmed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosomes belong to the homoeologous group 2, indicating that D11-5 was a 2V(b) (2D) disomic substitution line. Field resistance showed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosomes 2V(b) were responsible for the stripe rust resistance at the adult plant stage. FISH, C-banding, and PCR-based molecular marker analysis indicated that the chromosome 2V(b) of D. breviaristatum was completely different from the chromosome 2V of D. villosum. The identified wheat-D. breviaristatum chromosome substitution line D11-5 may be applied to produce agronomically desirable stripe rust resistance germplasm.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247402","annotations":[{"name":"Introgression","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introgression"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.686781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.635623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Repeated sequence (DNA)","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_sequence_(DNA)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chromosome 2 (human)","weight":0.59066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_2_(human)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Ploidy","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"},{"name":"Molecular marker","weight":0.527063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_marker"},{"name":"Germplasm","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germplasm"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.282513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.268501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Rust (fungus)","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus)"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Plant disease resistance","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_disease_resistance"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Triticeae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triticeae"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Harbor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}]}
