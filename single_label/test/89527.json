{"id":89527,"title":"Structural biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid within 24?h after a traumatic spinal cord injury: a descriptive analysis of 16 subjects.","abstract":"Prospective cohort study.To characterize the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron specific enolase (NSE), S-100?, tau and neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) within 24?h of an acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), and to correlate these concentrations with the baseline severity of neurologic impairment as graded by the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale (AIS).A lumbar puncture was performed to obtain CSF from 16 acute traumatic SCI patients within 24?h post injury. Neurological examinations were performed within 24?h of injury and again at 6 or 12 months post injury. The correlations between the CSF concentrations and initial AIS were calculated by using Pearson correlation coefficients. In addition, an independent Student's t-test was used to test for differences in CSF concentrations between patients of different AIS grades.The CSF NSE concentrations were significantly correlated with the baseline neurologic impairment being either 'motor complete' (AIS A, B) or 'motor incomplete' (AIS C, D) (r=0.520, P<0.05). The mean S-100? concentration in motor complete patients was significantly higher compared with motor incomplete patients; 377.2??g?l(-1) (s.d.±523??g?l(-1)) vs 57.1??g?l(-1) (s.d.±56??g?l(-1)) (P<0.05), respectively. Lastly, the mean NFH concentration in motor complete patients was significantly higher compared with motor incomplete patient, 11?813?ng?l(-1) (s.d.±16?195?ng?l(-1)) vs 1446.8?ng?l(-1) (s.d.±1533?ng?l(-1)), (P<0.05), respectively.In this study we identified differences in the structural CSF biomarkers NSE, S-100? and NFH between motor complete and motor incomplete SCI patients. Our data showed no clear differences in any of the protein concentrations between the different AIS grades.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Wounds and
