{"id":81208,"title":"Platform switching and abutment emergence profile modification on peri-implant soft tissue.","abstract":"Although the peri-implant hard tissue advantages of platform switching abutments have been well documented by many authors, the peri-implant soft tissue advantages of platform switching abutments has had limited mention. This article illustrates how the amount of peri-implant soft tissue volume is influenced by the dimensional extent of platform switching and the degree that an abutment's sulcular emergence profile has been modified. This article also introduces the term \"abutment sulcular emergence profile enhancement\" (ASEPE) to describe the combined effect of platform switching and abutment emergence profile modification. Three unrecognized clinical advantages of ASEPE are described by different clinical cases. First, elimination of excessive abutment impingement on gingival tissue adjacent to implants is achieved. Second, allowance for sufficient interproximal space between implant and adjacent tooth/implant for the entry of interproximal toothbrush is made possible. Third, excessive soft tissue blanching during abutment seating at prosthesis delivery is eliminated. Together, the combined application of platform switching and abutment emergence profile modification represents the opening of a new realm for managing soft tissue around implants to resolve dimensional problems.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269220","annotations":[{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.813785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.447025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0952762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mod (video gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Diplomatic recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Realm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realm"},{"name":"Blanching (cooking)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanching_(cooking)"},{"name":"Sulcular epithelium","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcular_epithelium"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"}]}
