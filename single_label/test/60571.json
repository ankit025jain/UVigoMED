{"id":60571,"title":"Feasibility of optical coherence tomography in children with Kawasaki disease and pediatric heart transplant recipients.","abstract":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution intravascular imaging technique used in adults. We tested the hypothesis that OCT could identify coronary abnormalities not seen by angiography in children with a history of Kawasaki disease (KD) and pediatric heart transplant (TX) recipients.Patients with KD and TX recipients were evaluated between December 2012 and October 2013 with angiography and OCT (Ilumien System, LightLabs, St Jude Medical, Westford, MA). Modifications were made to the adult OCT protocol to adapt this technique for children. Serial cross-sectional area measurements of the lumen, intima, and media were made. Entire imaging data were analyzed for the presence of qualitative changes. Seventeen children were evaluated (5 patients with KD; 12 TX recipients). In patients with KD, angiography was normal. However, OCT imaging revealed that significant vessel wall abnormalities were present in all children including intimal thickening (intima/lumen cross-sectional area ratio>0.4), loss of the normal layered structure of the vessel wall, white thrombus, calcification, and neovascularization. There was extensive destruction of the internal elastic lamina. In TX recipients, angiography was normal; however, intimal thickening (intima/media cross-sectional area ratio>1) was seen in 9 of 12 patients. The median intima/media cross-sectional area ratio was 1.18.In this initial experience with OCT in children, we have identified significant coronary abnormalities with OCT that are angiographically silent in children with a history of coronary aneurysms because of KD and in pediatric TX recipients.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
