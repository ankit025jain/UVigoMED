There were 10 males and 2 females, aged from 25 to 48 years old (means 35 years old). According to Sanders classifi- cation system, there were 7 feet with type II, 6 feet with type III. The Böhler angle and Gissane angle were compared before and after operation. The clinical results were evaluated with the Maryland foot score system.All 12 cases were followed up from 6 to 14 months (means 10 months). There were no incision complications. Fracture healing time was from 3 to 6 months (means 4 months). The Böhler angle increased from preoperative (11.19 +/- 5.69) degrees to postoperative (30.13 +/- 7.52) degrees; The Gissane angle increased from preoperative (108.31 +/- 10.35) degrees to postoperative (118.99 +/- 8.94) degrees. According to Maryland foot score system, 8 feet got an excellent result, 3 good, 2 fair.Open reduction by sinus tarsi approach and external fixation with calcaneal locking plates is an effective method for treatment of Sanders II, III calcaneal fracture. It can obtain good reduction and stable fixation with minimal invasion and lower complications.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605736","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.706967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.517126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.305318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.272491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.170898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.170212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Calcaneus","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"},{"name":"Maryland","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Cation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation"},{"name":"Good reduction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_reduction"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
