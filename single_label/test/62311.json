{"id":62311,"title":"The impact of R-VACOP-B and interim FDG-PET/CT on outcome in primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma.","abstract":"The choice of a rituximab-based regimen and the prognostic significance of interim 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) are debatable. We evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of 95 consecutive patients with PMBCL who were treated between 1985 and 2009. Forty-three patients received rituximab-based chemotherapy, R-VACOP-B (N = 30) or R-CHOP21 (N = 13), whereas 52 patients were treated with VACOP-B (N = 47) or CHOP21 (N = 5). Radiotherapy was not given. Patients who received rituximab had a 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 79 % and overall survival (OS) of 97 % compared with 58 % (p = 0.06) and 88 % (p = 0.2), respectively, without rituximab. Five-year PFS in patients treated with R-VACOP-B, R-CHOP21, VACOP-B, and CHOP21 were 83, 69, 62, and 20 %, respectively (p = 0.039). However, direct comparison showed that the difference between PFS rates in patients receiving R-VACOP-B compared to R-CHOP21 was not statistically significant (p = 0.3). None of the standard clinical risk factors predicted for PFS and OS in patients receiving rituximab (R)-chemotherapy. Mid-interim FDG-PET/CT scans were performed in 30/43 patients who received R-chemotherapy. The negative predictive values of mid-PET activity were high (100 % for R-VACOP-B and 86 % for R-CHOP21) while the positive predictive values (PPV) were relatively low (30 and 75 %, respectively). Despite the low PPV, the 5-year PFS for mid-PET-negative patients (N = 16) was significantly higher (94 %) than that for mid-PET-positive (N = 14) patients (57 %, p = 0.015). This retrospective analysis demonstrates that the superiority of VACOP-B over CHOP21 for treatment of PMBCL disappeared once rituximab was added. The potential benefit of using interim PET activity as a guide for continuing therapy in patients with PMBCL remains unclear due to the relatively low PPV.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595734","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.830425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.698854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.642332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.611786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.215541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
