{"id":20077,"title":"Incidence of infection after Mohs micrographic and dermatologic surgery before and after implementation of new sterilization guidelines.","abstract":"Clinical guidelines regarding surgical instrument sterilization established by accrediting organizations should be based on peer-reviewed scientific literature. Few data exist in the scientific literature to support the changes in sterilization protocols imposed by accrediting organizations.We sought to determine whether recently established guidelines for the sterilization of surgical instruments have had any clinical impact on postsurgical infection rates.Infections rates after excisional and Mohs micrographic surgery before and after implementation of new Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations sterilization guidelines were examined retrospectively. All surgeries were performed at an academic outpatient office.In all, 1415 patients underwent a total of 1688 surgeries. No significant differences were observed in mean patient age (P = .113), mean number of Mohs micrographic surgical levels (P = .067), final defect size (P = .305), patient gender (P = .072), repair type (P = .691), or infection rate (P = .453). No major differences in predisposing factors were identified in patients who developed postsurgical infections.This was a retrospective study conducted at a single academic institution.In our practice, recent changes in surgical instrument sterilization protocols have had no impact on postsurgical infection rates. The implementation of such guidelines places an additional burden on the health care system without providing any improvement in patient outcomes.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680104","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Joint Commission","weight":0.499661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Commission"},{"name":"Surgical instrument","weight":0.454069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_instrument"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.415845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.302985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.248379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.060221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Accreditation","weight":0.0451805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accreditation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mohs surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_surgery"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mohs scale of mineral hardness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness"},{"name":"1688","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1688"},{"name":"305","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/305"},{"name":"1415","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1415"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Micrographia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrographia"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Academic institution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_institution"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Minuscule 453","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_453"},{"name":"Educational accreditation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_accreditation"}]}
