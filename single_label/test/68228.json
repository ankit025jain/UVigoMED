{"id":68228,"title":"Metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease in a Southern Chinese population.","abstract":"To explore the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MS) and risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a Southern Chinese population.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1724 community-based Southern Chinese participants from June to October 2012. The prevalence of MS (as defined by the International Diabetes Federation) and CKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and/or albuminuria) was determined. The association between MS and CKD was then analyzed using STATA software.Metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with CKD (P < 0.001) in the unadjusted analyses as well as after adjustment for potential confounders. The unadjusted odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for MS were 3.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62 to 4.75, P < 0.001) and 2.52 (95% CI 1.84 to 3.54, P < 0.001). When further adjusted for diabetes and hypertension, the association of MS and CKD was significant (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32, P = 0.006). After adjustment for potential confounders, three components and four/five components were associated with CKD. The OR for three components and four/five components were 2.90 (95% CI 1.70 to 4.96, P < 0.001) and 3.64(95% CI 1.95 to 6.80, P < 0.001), when compared with those without components. High blood pressure, high serum triglyceride level, elevated fasting glucose level and central obesity were associated with CKD (P < 0.05). The odds ratios for elevated blood pressure, elevated serum triglyceride levels, elevated fasting glucose and central obesity were 1.80 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), 1.56 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.14, P = 0.006), 2.54 (95% CI 1.82 to 3.57, P < 0.001), and 1.50 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.07, P = 0.01), respectively.These findings suggest that MS is associated with CKD in Southern Chinese population, which may provide important information for the overall control of these diseases.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548104","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.93643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.873003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.688416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.354746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"International Diabetes Federation","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Diabetes_Federation"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"China","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
