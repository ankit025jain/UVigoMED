{"id":91694,"title":"Anterior medial meniscal root avulsions due to malposition of the tibial tunnel during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: two case reports.","abstract":"The meniscal roots are essential for preserving the native biomechanical and structural properties of the tibiofemoral joint. Meniscus root avulsions, which disrupt the normal meniscus anchoring points, have been reported to result in deleterious biomechanics and clinical outcomes. In this series, two cases of iatrogenic medial meniscus anterior root avulsions after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are reported. Iatrogenic medial meniscus anterior root avulsions after malpositioning of the tibial tunnels during ACL reconstruction have not been previously reported in the literature and may account for poor long-term outcomes seen in some patients after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, careful attention must be paid to correct tibial tunnel placement during ACL reconstruction.Case series, Level IV.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482217","annotations":[{"name":"Knee","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.755703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.710022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.456423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Medial meniscus","weight":0.350268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_meniscus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.223047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Meniscus","weight":0.0804089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.0501171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Anchoring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Avulsion (river)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_(river)"},{"name":"Anterior root of spinal nerve","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_root_of_spinal_nerve"},{"name":"Native plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
