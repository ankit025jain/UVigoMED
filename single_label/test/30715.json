{"id":30715,"title":"[Selected data of acute poisonings with ethylene glycol and methanol in Poland in the year 2010].","abstract":"There are no reliable studies in Poland evaluating the scale of acute intoxications with different type of xenobiotics. The aim of the study was to evaluate selected problems referring to the patients intoxicated with ethylene glycol and methanol, who were given the medical treatment in all Toxicological (TUs) and Intensive Care Units (ICUs), having contract with Polish National Fund of Health, in the year 2010. All cases of acute intoxications treated in polish hospitals in 2010 and reported to the Polish National Fund of Health were included to the analysis. To further analysis were chosen only those patients, whose main diagnosis or co-morbidities were coded as T 51.1 or T 52.3, according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision and, according to the state of health, patients were treated in TUs and ICUs. All the cases, in which intoxication was not the main health problem were excluded.There were 85 230 acute poisonings in Poland in 2010, 503 of them referred to ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings. 220 patients were treated in TUs and ICUs. The most common methods of therapy in those units were extracorporeal toxin removal (53.22% in TUs and 52.08% in ICUs) and conservative treatment (46.78% in TUs and 47.92% in ICUs). The mortality rate in ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings in TUs and ICUs were 20.97% and 48.96% respectively. In the conservatively treated group the mortality rates in TUs and ICUs were 15.52% and 54.35% respectively, while in extracorporeal toxin removal group the mortality rates in TUs and ICUs were 25.76% and 44.00% respectively. The authors also observed one region (Mak√≥w Mazowiecki), in which the amount of ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings was much higher than in the rest part of the country.1. All the cases of acute intoxications of glycol and methanol should be consulted with Polish Poison Control Centers. 2. It is necessary to establish diagnostic and treatment protocols for intoxicated patients in Poland. 3. There is a strong need for popularization of the modern methods of glycol and methanol poisonings therapy and increasing the availability of modern antidotes. 4. It is necessary to continue monitoring and evaluation of different ways of treatment glycol and methanol intoxications. 5. The cases of abnormally high rate of glycol and methanol intoxications in some hospitals should be investigated.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466678","annotations":[{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.876779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.632809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.545074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.543805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.393353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.338155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.28711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.280531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.268607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Ethylene glycol","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Poison control center","weight":0.113089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_control_center"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Ethylene","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Xenobiotic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
