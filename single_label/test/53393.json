{"id":53393,"title":"T cell-derived IL-22 amplifies IL-1?-driven inflammation in human adipose tissue: relevance to obesity and type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Proinflammatory cytokines are critically involved in the alteration of adipose tissue biology leading to deterioration of glucose homeostasis in obesity. Here we show a pronounced proinflammatory signature of adipose tissue macrophages in type 2 diabetic obese patients, mainly driven by increased NLRP3-dependent interleukin (IL)-1? production. IL-1? release increased with glycemic deterioration and decreased after gastric bypass surgery. A specific enrichment of IL-17- and IL-22-producing CD4(+) T cells was found in adipose tissue of type 2 diabetic obese patients. Coculture experiments identified the effect of macrophage-derived IL-1? to promote IL-22 and IL-17 production by human adipose tissue CD4(+) T cells. Reciprocally, adipose tissue macrophages express IL-17 and IL-22 receptors, making them sensitive to IL-17 and IL-22. IL-22 increased IL-1? release by inducing pro-IL-1? transcription through activation of C-Jun pathways in macrophages. In sum, these human data identified IL-1? and the T-cell cytokine IL-22 as key players of a paracrine inflammatory pathway previously unidentified in adipose tissue, with a pathological relevance to obesity-induced type 2 diabetes. These results provide an additional rationale for targeting IL-1? in obesity-linked type 2 diabetes and may have important implications for the conception of novel combined anti-IL-1? and anti-IL-22 immunotherapy in human obesity.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520123","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.902673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Paracrine signalling","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracrine_signalling"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.657598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.641092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.577319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.359372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.172966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"}]}
