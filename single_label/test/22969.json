{"id":22969,"title":"Associated factors with surgical site infections after hepatectomy: predictions and countermeasures by a retrospective cohort study.","abstract":"To clarify the factors associated with post-hepatectomy surgical site infections (SSIs), the clinicopathological data of 526 patients who underwent hepatectomy was retrospectively examined as a retrospectively cohort study.Patient demographics, liver functions, histological findings, surgical records and post-hepatectomy morbidity were compared between non-SSI and SSI groups; the SSI group included superficial and deep SSIs.The prevalence of SSIs (5-8%) has not changed over an 18-year period. Deep SSIs were significantly more increased in male patients with lower performance statuses and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores (p < 0.05). SSIs tended to be less prevalent, although not significant (p = 0.10), in patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomies compared to those who underwent laparotomies. For patients in whom hemostatic devices were used, the prevalence of superficial SSIs was significantly lower than those in whom the devices were not used (p < 0.05). Blood loss and transfusion were significantly more frequent in the deep SSI group compared to other groups (p < 0.01). Hospital stay in the deep SSI group was significantly longer compared to other groups. The incidence of morbidity was more frequent in the SSI groups compared with the non-SSI group (p < 0.001). A multivariate analysis showed that not using a vessel sealing device was significantly associated with superficial SSIs; male gender, hepatic failure and bile leakage were significantly associated with deep SSIs (p < 0.05).SSIs were important indicators of patient outcomes after hepatectomies, and preventing SSI development after surgical procedures is an important step in improving the overall prevalence of SSIs.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
