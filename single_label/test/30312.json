{"id":30312,"title":"Randomized clinical trial of topiramate for levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"The antiepileptic drug topiramate reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesia without exacerbating parkinsonism in animal models. We report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in patients with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia.Fifteen patients with Parkinson's disease and stable levodopa-induced dyskinesia were enrolled into the study, of whom 13 were randomized to topiramate or placebo. The study medication was titrated to 100 mg/day over four weeks, and assessments were carried out after a further two weeks. Dyskinesia severity assessed by a blinded rater from video recordings was the primary outcome measure.Seven patients (mean age 58.9 ± 12.8 years) completed the study. Patients taking topiramate vs. placebo showed a significant increase in dyskinesia severity compared to baseline (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.043). Five patients withdrew from the study whilst taking topiramate due to adverse effects.Topiramate tended to worsen dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease, and was poorly tolerated.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521874","annotations":[{"name":"Topiramate","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiramate"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.319121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Chromosomal crossover","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover"}]}
