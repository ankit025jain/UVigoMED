{"id":90862,"title":"Basal cell carcinoma of the axilla: review of the world literature.","abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the axilla is rare; indeed, 70 axillary BCCs have been described in 69 patients. Using the PubMed database, an extensive literature search was performed on BCC, axilla, and axillary. Relevant papers were reviewed and the characteristics of individuals with BCC of the axilla were summarized. The calculated prevalence of axillary BCC was 0.17%. They occurred predominantly in Caucasians. The majority of patients had no obvious BCC-associated risk factors. They were observed 1.2 times more often in men than in women and twice as often in the right axilla than the left axilla. They frequently presented as an asymptomatic nodule; however, associated features have included elongation of the tumor along the axillary skin lines, ulceration, and pigmentation. The axillary tumor was typically associated with either the superficial or the nodular histologic subtype of BCC. The prognosis for these patients was usually excellent following complete removal or destruction of the tumor. In conclusion, axillary BCC is a rare clinical variant of this type of skin cancer that usually presents as an asymptomatic nodule in an individual who does not have any traditional risk factors for this malignancy. The cancer was typically associated with a non-aggressive histologic subtype. Recurrence or metastasis was uncommon following treatment of the primary tumor.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567258","annotations":[{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Basal-cell carcinoma","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.711753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.498671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.298706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.200316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
