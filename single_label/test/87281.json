{"id":87281,"title":"Operative management of acute pavement burns: a case series.","abstract":"Acute burns suffered from contact with environmentally heated roadways and walkways are a rare entity. The aim of this report is to assess the information gained from the treatment of a series of patients.A retrospective review of a consecutive series of cases, where operative treatment was necessary, that occurred during July 2010 in southern Arizona.Seven patients were included, with an average total body surface area burn of 10.2%. Direct fascial excision and tangential excision were carried out on three and four patients, respectively. Although tangential excision was carried out to normal endpoints, there was commonly a need for repetitive debridement. The total hospital costs were over $4,400,000 (Â£2,730,000).Burns suffered from contact with roadways/walkways are often deeper than suggested by their appearance. Direct fascial excision minimises the number of debridement sessions. We hypothesise that the failure to offload pressure on these wounds may be a causative factor in their observed deepening.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375404","annotations":[{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.487397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Arizona","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.14962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area"},{"name":"Total body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_body_surface_area"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Tangent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent"},{"name":"730","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/730"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Sidewalk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Road surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_surface"},{"name":"Causative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causative"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Marion True","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_True"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"},{"name":"Southern Arizona","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Arizona"}]}
