{"id":92670,"title":"The safe delivery of fractional ablative carbon dioxide laser treatment for acne scars in Asian patients receiving oral isotretinoin.","abstract":"Because acne scarring is associated with substantially reduced quality of life, early initiation of effective treatment is desirable. In previous reports, isotretinoin treatment was associated with increased scarring after cosmetic procedures, such as laser treatment, dermabrasion, and chemical peeling.To evaluate wound healing after ablative carbon dioxide (CO2) fractional resurfacing for acne scarring conducted during and/or within 1 to 3 months of oral isotretinoin treatment.The records of 20 patients with facial acne scars were included in this retrospective study. All patients were receiving isotretinoin treatment or had completed it within the previous 1 to 3 months. All patients received full-face fractional ablative CO2 laser treatment. Follow-up was for at least 6 months to evaluate side effects.All patients showed normal reepithelialization and were satisfied with the results of the laser treatments. All adverse events were minor, and there were no hypertrophic scars or keloids.Ablative CO2 fractional laser treatment for acne scarring seems to be safe regardless of isotretinoin use (10-60 mg/d). The authors' findings contribute to the discussion of whether oral isotretinoin treatment impairs wound healing after ablative laser treatment.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25361201","annotations":[{"name":"Dermabrasion","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermabrasion"},{"name":"Acne vulgaris","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_vulgaris"},{"name":"Acne","weight":0.851207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide laser","weight":0.80179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Isotretinoin","weight":0.711652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotretinoin"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.681145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.484962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"},{"name":"Hypertrophic scar","weight":0.432155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_scar"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.360818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.344936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.322908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.269652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Cosmetic surgery","weight":0.118849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetic_surgery"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Photorejuvenation","weight":0.0173036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorejuvenation"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
