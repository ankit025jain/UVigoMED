{"id":71662,"title":"Cancer in a 29-county area in eastern North Carolina: an opportunity to reduce health inequities.","abstract":"Cancer mortality rates are higher in a 29-county area of Eastern North Carolina than in the state's other 71 counties combined; within this 29-county subregion, African Americans have higher cancer mortality rates than whites. Better integration of health promotion and structural changes that improve health care access and delivery are needed to reduce these disparities.
