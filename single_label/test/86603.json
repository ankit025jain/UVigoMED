DP??????????????????????????????2???????????VP???DP?????????????NSCLC?Platinum plus a third-generation agent doublet chemotherapy is the standard regimen and first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus platinum (DP) compared with vinorelbine plus platinum (VP) regimens in patients with advanced NSCLC.We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, VIP, and WanFang databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in which DP regimen was compared with VP regimen. A quality assessment of qualified RCTs was performed according to Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0, and Stata 12.0 was used to perform meta-analysis.Seven RCTs involving 2,318 patients were included. Meta-analysis results indicated that the DP regimen increased the two-year survival rate (HR=0.887, 95%CI: 0.810-0.972, P=0.010), response rate (RR=1.276, 95%CI: 1.107 -1.450, P=0.001), and diarrhea rate (RR=3.134, 95%CI: 1.918-5.121, P<0.001) compared with the VP regimen. Anemia rate was also reduced (RR=0.386, 95%CI: 0.311-0.478, P<0.001). No statistical differences were observed between DP and VP regimens in terms of one-year survival rate, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.DP regimen reduced the rate of anemia and increased the rate of diarrhea, two-year survival rate, and response rate. Therefore, DP regimen may be a more effective option as a first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC compared with VP regimen.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758908","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Vinorelbine","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinorelbine"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.193068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.121401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0961829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"}]}
