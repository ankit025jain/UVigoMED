{"id":21439,"title":"Frequency of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing and non-KPC-producing Klebsiella species contamination of healthcare workers and the environment.","abstract":"We examined contamination of healthcare worker (HCW) gown and gloves after caring for patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing and non-KPC-producing Klebsiella as a proxy for horizontal transmission. The rate of contamination with Klebsiella species is similar to that of contamination with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, with 31 (14%) of 220 of HCW-patient interactions resulting in contamination of gloves and gowns.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602950","annotations":[{"name":"Species","weight":0.537637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Horizontal transmission","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_transmission"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Glove","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Proxy war","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war"},{"name":"Gown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gown"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"}]}
