{"id":91156,"title":"First-aid treatments of crush injuries after earthquake: 2 special cases.","abstract":"Hyperkalemia and acute renal failure are the life-threatening complications of crush injuries. Vigilant prehospital emergency care is vital to reduce the complications. We report and discuss 2 cases diagnosed as crush syndrome after earthquake, in order to illustrate the value of prehospital application of tourniquets to prevent hyperkalemia accompanying extremity crush injuries. The victim in case 1 died of hyperkalemia shortly after extrication without tourniquet. The prehospital tourniquet had been used to avoid uncontrollable hemorrhage and release of toxic metabolites into the circulation in case 2. Providers need to be fully aware of the risk of hyperkalemia in the field for patients with crush syndrome. Tourniquet application is strongly recommended in the prehospital setting for severe crush injuries.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534195","annotations":[{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.510971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Tourniquet","weight":0.47261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourniquet"},{"name":"Hyperkalemia","weight":0.388223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkalemia"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Crush syndrome","weight":0.237801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_syndrome"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Vehicle extrication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_extrication"},{"name":"Providers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providers"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
