{"id":82597,"title":"Evaluation of three different caries removal techniques in children: a comparative clinical study.","abstract":"To evaluate and compare the efficacy of chemo mechanical (carie care) caries removal method with rotary and hand excavation by assessing the amount of time taken, the pain response experienced by the children and the amount of residual caries left out.Twenty patients between the age groups of 5-7 years were selected and caries removal was done by airotor hand instruments and cariecare gel. The efficacy, time taken and pain threshold was evaluated during caries removal.significant results were obtained when inter group comparison were made.it was concluded that cariecare was efficient in caries removal and can be used as an alternative for the airotor in management of dental caries especially in children.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579278","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.711904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.63225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.609956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.491766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.48904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.375243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Threshold of pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Excavation (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excavation_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency"}]}
