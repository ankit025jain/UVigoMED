{"id":9501,"title":"Preventive effects of hyaluronan from deterioration of gait parameters in surgically induced mice osteoarthritic knee model.","abstract":"Osteoarthritis (OA) leads to pain and loss of function in affected joints. Gait disturbance results from these symptoms of OA, and gait analysis can be important to evaluate the progression of OA. The purpose of this study was to analyze gait pattern in a rodent model of OA and to assess the effects of intra-articular injection of hyaluronan (IAI-HA) by gait analysis, along with histological evaluation.OA was induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) of C57BL/6 mice. IAI-HA started 3 weeks after DMM surgery. Mice were allocated to three groups and were given either 800-kDa HA (800-HA), 6000-kDa HA (6000-HA) or saline. We compared these three groups with a sham group by gait analysis using CatWalk. Histological evaluation was performed to assess articular cartilage changes in the knee joints.Mice injected with 800-HA or 6000-HA showed gait patterns similar to that of the sham mice, while the saline-injected group showed gait disturbances 12 and 16 weeks after DMM surgery. Histological changes in articular cartilage were similar among the 800-HA, 6000-HA and saline-treated groups, demonstrating OA progression throughout the experimental time points. Positive gait-related effects of IAI-HA might occur by its pain relieving effect and/or by preventing contracture.IAI-HA prevented gait disturbances in the DMM model, but did not prevent histological changes associated with OA progression.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704496","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.782049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.692071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.490351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Medial meniscus","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_meniscus"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Gait analysis","weight":0.430089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_analysis"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.418952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Meniscus","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.265704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Gait abnormality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_abnormality"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"}]}
