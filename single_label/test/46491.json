{"id":46491,"title":"Is primary tumor resection associated with a longer survival in colon cancer and unresectable synchronous metastases? A 4-year multicentre experience.","abstract":"To explore the survival impact of primary tumor resection (PTR) in patients with metastatic colon cancer (mCC) and unresectable metastases.We retrospectively studied a multicenter cohort of consecutive mCC patients with unresectable metastases receiving first-line chemotherapy. A weighted Cox proportional regression model was used to balance for clinical variables associated with the probability of undergoing PTR, using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on a propensity score.Ninety-six patients were included. PTR was performed in 69 (72%). The rates of secondary resection of metastases (p = 0.02) and bevacizumab administration (p = 0.02) were higher in the PTR group. Raw median overall survival (OS) was 23.1 months (95%CI[14.6-27.8]) in the PTR group and 22.1 months (95%CI[12.3-23.7]) in the non-PTR group (p = 0.11). After adjustment on IPTW, OS was 23.1 months (95%CI[17.0-28.7]) in the PTR group and 17.2 months (95%CI[13.5-22.2]) in the non-PTR group (HR 0.68; 95%CI[0.50-0.93]; p = 0.016). This result remained significant on multivariate analysis (HR 0.71; 95%CI[0.50-1.00]; p = 0.05).In mCC patients with unresectable metastases receiving chemotherapy, up-front PTR was independently associated with prolonged OS. Patients eligible for secondary metastases resection and/or bevacizumab may benefit the most from PTR. Randomized controlled trials are mandatory.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630774","annotations":[{"name":"Probability","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Inverse probability","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_probability"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.561357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.445403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.432338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.371375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.275084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.239934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.227159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.119994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.112281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0589687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"David Cox (statistician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cox_(statistician)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Pool Test Reactor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_Test_Reactor"},{"name":"Upfront","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upfront"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 4","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_4"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"WWE Raw","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw"}]}
