{"id":45455,"title":"Development, production, and postmarketing surveillance of hepatitis A vaccines in China.","abstract":"China has long experience using live attenuated and inactivated vaccines against hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. We summarize this experience and provide recent data on adverse events after immunization (AEFIs) with hepatitis A vaccines in China. We reviewed the published literature (in Chinese and English) and the published Chinese regulatory documents on hepatitis A vaccine development, production, and postmarketing surveillance of AEFI. We described the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of hepatitis A vaccines and horizontal transmission of live HAV vaccine in China. In clinical trials, live HAV vaccine was associated with fever (0.4%-5% of vaccinees), rash (0%-1.1%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (0.015%). Inactivated HAV vaccine was associated with fever (1%-8%), but no serious AEFIs were reported. Live HAV vaccine had seroconversion rates of 83% to 91%, while inactivated HAV vaccine had seroconversion rates of 95% to 100%. Community trials showed efficacy rates of 90% to 95% for live HAV and 95% to 100% for inactivated HAV vaccine. Postmarketing surveillance showed that HAV vaccination resulted in an AEFI incidence rate of 34 per million vaccinees, which accounted for 0.7% of adverse events reported to the China AEFI monitoring system. There was no difference in AEFI rates between live and inactivated HAV vaccines. Live and inactivated HAV vaccines manufactured in China were immunogenic, effective, and safe. Live HAV vaccine had substantial horizontal transmission due to vaccine virus shedding; thus, further monitoring of the safety of virus shedding is warranted.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681843","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis A vaccine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A_vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.769619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.734941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Horizontal transmission","weight":0.585334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_transmission"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.562623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Viral shedding","weight":0.275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.0956607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}]}
