{"id":87146,"title":"Health insurance coverage for persons in HIV care, 2006-2012.","abstract":"We examined trends in health insurance coverage among 36,999 HIV-infected adults in care at 11 US HIV clinics between 2006 and 2012. Aggregate health insurance coverage was stable during this time. The proportions of patient-years with private, Medicaid, Medicare, and no insurance during this period were 15.9%, 35.7%, 20.1%, and 28.4%, respectively. Medicaid coverage was more prevalent among women than men, blacks, and Hispanics than whites, and individuals with injection drug use risk compared with other transmission risk factors. Hispanics and younger age groups were more likely to be uninsured than other racial/ethnic and older age groups, respectively.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977377","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Medicaid","weight":0.744551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.689504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.437146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.385244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.358398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Health insurance coverage in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"United States presidential election, 2012","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012"}]}
