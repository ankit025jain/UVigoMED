{"id":6102,"title":"Adipose-derived stem cells versus bone marrow-derived stem cells for vocal fold regeneration.","abstract":"Vocal fold scarring presents therapeutic challenges. Recently, cell therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells has become a promising approach. The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic potential of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) with bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSC) for vocal fold regeneration.Prospective animal experiments with controls.The vocal folds of Sprague-Dawley rats were unilaterally injured. Two months after injury, rats were treated with a local injection of ASC (ASC group), BMSC (BMSC group), or saline (sham-treated group). The GFP-labeled ASC and BMSC were extracted from CAG-EGFP rats. Larynges were harvested for histological and immunohistochemical examinations 1 and 3 months posttransplantation and for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1 month posttransplantation.After 1 month, no surviving cells from the transplant were detected. Histological examination showed significantly increased hyaluronic acid (HA) and decreased dense collagen deposition in both ASC and BMSC groups compared to shams 1 and 3 months after treatment. Real-time PCR revealed that hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1) and Has2 were upregulated in only the ASC group compared with the sham-treated group. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (basic) (Fgf2), hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf) and Has3 were upregulated in both cell transplantation groups. ASC seemed to upregulate Hgf more than did BMSC.The regenerative effects of ASC and BMSC transplantation were found to be similar for the restoration. It is suggested that ASC might have more potential because of better recovery of HA, a superior antifibrotic effect, and the upregulation of Hgf.N/A.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Animal
