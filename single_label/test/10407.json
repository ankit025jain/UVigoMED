{"id":10407,"title":"Study on anti-atherosclerotic effect of Suxiao Jiuxin Pill and its mechanism.","abstract":"Suxiao Jiuxin Pill is composed of Ligusticum wallichii, Borneolum Syntheticum and other drugs; it has qi promoting and blood circulation activating, meridian dredging and pain relieving efficacies. The objective of this paper is to study the effect of Suxiao Jiuxin Pill (quick-acting heart reliever), in atherosclerosis (AS) rat model and explore the mechanism for its prevention and treatment of AS.AS rat model was established by high cholesterol diet and single intra-peritoneal injection of increased dose of vitamin D3.Compared with the model group, Suxiao Jiuxin Pill medium-and high-dose groups and atorvastatin group can effectively regulate lipid metabolism.We conclude that Suxiao Jiuxin Pill has a good hypo-lipidemic effect, and can inhibit the occurrence and development of AS.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653560","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Atorvastatin","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.74408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Hypolipidemic agent","weight":0.716493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypolipidemic_agent"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.715967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.314495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Pill (pharmacy)","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
