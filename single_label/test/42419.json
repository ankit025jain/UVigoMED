{"id":42419,"title":"The increasing incidence of remote metastasis: a case report of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma to the rectosigmoid.","abstract":"As the fifth most common malignancy worldwide, survival rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have only slightly improved over the years due to early-stage detection. HCC is well known to metastasize to the lung, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal regions; however, only 0.5% to 6% of HCCs metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract. In the case described here, a CT scan and subsequent colonoscopy of a 51-year-old Asian male with a history of hepatitis B and HCC revealed a mass lesion of metastatic HCC 12 cm from the anal verge. Because metastatic HCC to the lower gastrointestinal tract has only recently been reported, it is speculated that the prolonged survival of patients is also increasing the incidence of extrahepatic metastasis, giving the disease greater opportunity to spread to more distant regions of the body. This case may be the farthest metastasis within the gastrointestinal tract to date.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852872","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.800517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.638615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.399803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.310248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
