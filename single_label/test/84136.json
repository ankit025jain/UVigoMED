{"id":84136,"title":"[Laparoscopy-assisted subtotal colectomy with transanal specimen extraction for slow transit constipation].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical application of laparoscopy-assisted subtotal colectomy with transanal specimen extraction for slow transit constipation(STC).Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 8 cases with STC undergoing the procedure mentioned above from February to November 2013. Pre-and post-operative constipation was assessed using Wexner Constipation and Incontinence Scales, and quality of life was assessed using Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index.All the operations were completely successful without postoperative complications, such as intestinal fistula, pelvic infection, anastomotic stricture, intestinal obstruction. The Operative time was (287.6 ± 21.5) min, blood loss was (109.7 ± 41.1) ml, time to first flatus was (2.5 ± 0.9) d. The proportion of postoperative constipation symptom index improvement was(77.6 ± 8.3)%. Postoperative quality of life score was 97.3 ± 15.7, significantly higher than that before operation(P<0.05). Postoperative Wexner constipation score was 8.8 ± 3.7, significantly lower than that before operation.Laparoscopy-assisted subtotal colectomy with transanal specimen extraction in the treatment of STC has good short-term efficacy with obvious improvement in quality of life.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164897","annotations":[{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Flatulence","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Wexner Center for the Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wexner_Center_for_the_Arts"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Endometritis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometritis"},{"name":"List of Firefly characters","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefly_characters"},{"name":"Life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
