{"id":61781,"title":"[Effect of Qinghuang Powder combined Chinese herbs for Pi-strengthening and Shen-reinforcing on HIF-1alpha in bone marrow mononuclear cells of myelodysplastic syndrome patients: an experimental research].","abstract":"To study the effect of Qinghuang Powder (QHP) combined Chinese herbs for Pi-strengthening and Shen-reinforcing (CHPSSR) on hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in bone marrow mononuclear cells of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.Changes of HIF-1alpha in bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS patients were detected in 25 MDS patients treated by QHP combined CHPSSR using flow cytometry. Meanwhile, 13 healthy subjects were recruited as the control group. Changes HIF-1alpha levels in various serial bone marrow mononuclear cells were detected.(1) Among the 25 patients in the treatment group, there were 19 patients effective and 6 patients ineffective, with the total effective rate being 76%. (2) Compared with before treatment, levels of peripheral blood WBC, Hb, PLT, and ANC significantly increased in the treatment group after treatment, showing statistical difference (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). (3) Compared with before treatment, the HIF-1alpha mean fluorescence intensity was enhanced in bone marrow lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and nucleated red blood cells of the treatment group after treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, the HIF-1alpha mean fluorescence intensity was weakened in bone marrow lymphocytes, monocytes, and nucleated red blood cells of the treatment group before treatment; while it was obviously enhanced in granulocytes (P < 0.01). But after treatment the HIF-1alpha mean fluorescence intensity increased more in the granulocytes of the treatment group than in those of the control group (P < 0.01), but there was no statistical difference in bone marrow lymphocytes, monocytes, or nucleated red blood cells.QHP combined CHPSSR could improve HIF-1alpha levels in bone marrow lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and nucleated red blood cells of MDS patients, thus improving Hb levels of MDS patients, and improving their anemia and correlated symptoms.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672941","annotations":[{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.728395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.720725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.666402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.665585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.59418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.526043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.320456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.309215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.263746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"China","weight":0.205101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
