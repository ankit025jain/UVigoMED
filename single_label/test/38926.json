{"id":38926,"title":"[Role of psychological correction in the combination treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficiency of psychotherapeutic methods on the clinical course of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), quality of life (QL), esophagogastroduodenoscopic findings and 24-hour pH monitoring readings in patients with this condition.Sixty patients with GERD were divided into equal groups according to performed therapy: standard drug treatment or its combination with psychotherapeutic methods. The investigators estimated the degree of esophageal mucosal damage by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal acidity by 24-hour pH monitoring, and the magnitude of clinical manifestations by the Likert scale and assessed QL by the SF-36 questionnaire. The psychoemotional health component was analyzed using the clinical questionnaire for the identification and evaluation of neurotic states (CQIENS), the Leonhard-Shmichek characterological questionnaire, and the individual typological questionnaire.The patients with GERD were found to have individual personal traits and a definite psychological response. Incorporation of psychotherapeutic methods into the combination therapy was ascertained to have an additional therapeutic effect against the clinical manifestations of GERD, psychological responses in the patients, and QL indicators. There was a direct relationship between the psychological component of QL and the data of the CQIENS questionnaire. The most significant correlation was found between the CQIENS anxiety scores and the psychological component of QL (r = 0.73; p = 0.00004). Correlation analysis in the patients with GERD showed a relationship between the CQIENS anxiety scores and the clinical index (r = -0.68; p = 0.0001).The use of psychotherapeutic methods in addition to standard drug therapy improves both the physical and psychological states in patients with GERD and has some impact on a reduction in the magnitude of clinical symptomatology. This may contribute to the prompter recovery of patients and create prerequisites for improving their QL.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306743","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.685678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.422509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.405328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.294978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Neurosis","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.215315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.16565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.154122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0530024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0168556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
