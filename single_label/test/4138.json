{"id":4138,"title":"Is the combined use of insulin resistance indices, including adipokines, more reliable in metabolic syndrome?","abstract":"To determine the levels of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin) and the indices of insulin sensitivity/ resistance, and to examine the relationship among them in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).The study groups included 45 subjects with MetS (31 women/14 men), and 45 sex- and age-matched non-MetS healthy volunteers (31 women/14 men). The levels of adipokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The levels of leptin and visfatin were significantly higher in the MetS than in the non-MetS subjects (P < 0.01). There was no difference in adiponectin levels in subjects with and without MetS (P = 0.052). Similarly, resistin did not show any statistically significant difference. A statistically significant positive correlation ofleptin with insulin levels was observed, while negative correlations of visfatin levels with age, and resistin levels with the ratio of adiponectin to leptin, were found in the MetS (P <0.05). The combination of adipokines, insulin resistance-sensitivity parameters, and MetS criteria parameters gave more significant differences than a single parameter.Since the parameters mentioned above might affect, interact with, and/or interfere with each other, the combinations of these parameters might give more reliable results to evaluate the insulin resistance/sensitivity in MetS patients.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552156","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.656832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Resistin","weight":0.104468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_phosphoribosyltransferase"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
