{"id":92520,"title":"Short bone-conserving stems in cementless hip arthroplasty.","abstract":"? Short bone-conserving femoral stems in total hip arthroplasty were designed to preserve proximal bone stock.? Given the distinct fixation principles and location of loading among these bone-conserving stems, a classification system is essential to compare clinical outcomes.? Due to the low quality of currently available evidence, only a weak recommendation can be provided for clinical usage of certain stem designs, while some other designs cannot be recommended at this time.? A high prevalence of stem malalignment, incorrect sizing, subsidence, and intraoperative fractures has been reported in a subset of these short stem designs.? Stronger evidence, including prospective multicenter randomized trials comparing standard stems with these newer designs, is necessary before widespread use can be recommended.
