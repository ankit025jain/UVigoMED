{"id":23154,"title":"[The influence of genetic factors on the effectiveness of eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori infection in children].","abstract":"Efficacy of sequential eradication therapy for H. pylori was studied in 176 adolescents (mean age 14.3 years) with different PPI metabolism types. Group I consisted from the patients received omeprazole as PPI in combined treatment with amoxycilline, clarithromycine and tinidazole, Group II--patients treated with rabeprazole in the combination with the same antibacterial drugs. In all the patients, CYP2C19 genotype was identified as a control rate of PPI metabolism (extensive, intermediate and poor metabolizers). Sequential therapy in the children with intermediate and poor metabolic activity demonstrated a high eradication rate irrespective of PPI type (> 80%). In the patients with extensive metabolism taking omeprazole, eradication standard turned out to be lower (63.4%) than in the rabeprazole group (82.3%) (p = 0.026). Results of our survey confirmed a potential advantage of rabeprazole-based treatment compared with omeprazole-containing regimen in the sequential treatment of H. pylori infection in childhood.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501942","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.825349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"CYP2C19","weight":0.804199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C19"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.799138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Omeprazole","weight":0.728682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.668446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.226489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.134235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rabeprazole","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabeprazole"},{"name":"Tinidazole","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinidazole"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
