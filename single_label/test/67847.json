{"id":67847,"title":"Percutaneous microwave ablation of renal tumors using a gas-cooled 2.4-GHz probe: technique and initial results.","abstract":"The feasibility, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of renal tumors using a high-powered, carbon dioxide-cooled probe were evaluated. There were 15 tumors treated in 14 patients. Computed tomography was performed immediately after MWA, and follow-up imaging was performed to evaluate for recurrence. Immediate technical effectiveness was 100%. One complication involved the formation of a renal artery pseudoaneurysm. At follow-up (mean interval, 12.5 wk) evaluation, 14 of 15 (93.3%) tumors demonstrated complete necrosis. MWA is a safe, effective treatment modality; larger studies are warranted to demonstrate long-term oncologic outcomes.
