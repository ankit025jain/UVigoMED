{"id":36352,"title":"CT and MRI of pulmonary valvular abnormalities.","abstract":"Pulmonary valve disease constitutes a wide spectrum of conditions. Traditionally, echocardiography has been the technique of choice for the evaluation of pulmonary and other valvular disease. However, with advances in technology, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are playing increasingly important roles in the evaluation of these disorders. In this article, we review the normal appearance of the pulmonary valve and then illustrate various variants and pathological entities of the pulmonary valve.
