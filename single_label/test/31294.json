{"id":31294,"title":"[Behavioural studies during the gestational-lactation period in morphine treated rats].","abstract":"Opioids impair the maternal behaviour of experimental animals. The effect of morphine on maternal behaviour in rat dams treated chronically with morphine during the whole pregnancy and lactation has not been yet analysed systematically.The aim of our work was to investigate the behavioural effects of moderate dose morphine administered constantly in the whole perinatal period in rats.Nulliparous female rats were treated with 10 mg/kg morphine s.c. once daily, from the day of mating. Maternal behaviour was observed, the effects of acute morphine treatment on the maternal behaviour and whether this effect could be antagonised by naloxone were also investigated. Physical and other behavioural (anxiety-like signals in elevated plus maze, changes in locomotor activity) withdrawal signs precipitated by naloxone were registered. After weaning sensitivity to the rewarding effect of morphine was measured by conditioned place preference and to the aversive effect of naloxone by conditioned place aversion tests. Antinociceptive test on tail-flick apparatus was performed to investigate the changes in morphine antinociceptive effects due to chronic morphine treatment.Maternal behaviour was significantly impaired in morphine-treated dams. This effect of morphine lasted c.a. 2-3 hours a day, it showed dose-dependency and was enhanced in MO-treated group (sensitisation). Only weak physical and no other behavioural (anxiety-like behaviour or hypolocomotion) withdrawal signs were precipitated by naloxone. The positive reinforcing effect of morphine and aversive effect of naloxone were markedly increased on conditioned place paradigm. Significant antinociceptive tolerance was not seen.Although human drug abuse can be hardly modelling under experimental circumstances, our constant, relatively moderate dose morphine treatment administered once daily during the whole pregnancy and lactation resulted in several subtle behavioural changes in dams. In perinatally opioid-exposed offspring short- and long-term behavioural disturbances can be detected which is well-known from literature. Besides direct pharmacological effects of morphine impaired maternal responsiveness and pup care could play a role in these disturbances.","date":"2014-01-01","categories":"Chemically-Induced
