{"id":86827,"title":"[Genetic characterization of the Syr-Darya valley fever virus (SDVFV) (Picornaviridae, Cardiovirus) isolated from the blood of the patients and ticks Hyalomma as. asiaticum (Hyalomminae), Dermacentor daghestanicus (Rhipicephalinae) (Ixodidae) and Ornithod","abstract":"The Syr-Darya valley fever virus (SDVFV) was originally isolated from the blood of the patient with fever in the Kyzylorda province, Kazakhstan, in July 1973 and was classified to the Cardiovirus genus (fam. Picornaviridae). Later, SDVFV was isolated from the ticks Hyalomma as. asiaticum Schulze et Schlottke, 1929 (Hyalomminae) (1 strain) and Dermacentor daghestanicus Olenev, 1929 (Rhipicephalinae) (7 strains), collected in the floodplains of the Syr-Darya river and the Ili river. In this paper, complet genome of the SDVFV (strain LEIV-Tur2833) was sequenced using the next-generation sequencing approach (GenBank ID: KJ191558). It was demonstrated that, phylogenetically, the SDVFV is closely related closest to the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and Vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus (VMEV). The similarity of the SDVFV with VHEV and TMEV based on P1 region of the polyprotein-precursor (structural proteins VP1-VP4), reaches 75% and 91% for nucleotide sequences and 80% and 93% for putative amino acid sequences, respectively. For nonstructural proteins regions P2 (2A-2C) and P3 (3A-3D) similarity of SDVFV with TMEV and VHEV is 96%-98%.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549463","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.755917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.728404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.727416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.502951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Picornavirus","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picornavirus"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Coccidioidomycosis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidioidomycosis"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.355117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Kazakhstan","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.299985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"River","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dermacentor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermacentor"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"Joule","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule"},{"name":"Valley","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley"},{"name":"1973","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973"},{"name":"Floodplain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floodplain"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Biosafety level","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level"},{"name":"Encephalomyelitis","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalomyelitis"}]}
