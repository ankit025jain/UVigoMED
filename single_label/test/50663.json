{"id":50663,"title":"Incidence of multiglandular disease in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism.","abstract":"Multiple, minimally invasive surgical techniques have been developed over the last few decades for the management of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHTP). However, in cases with multiglandular disease, bilateral cervical exploration remains the gold standard. Therefore, it is important to have an accurate estimation of the incidence of multiglandular disease in sporadic PHTP.698 patients were treated for PHTP between 1993 and 2010 at the University Hospitals Leuven, using the bilateral cervical exploration method. After excluding cases of multiple endocrine carcinoma syndrome, the incidences of double adenoma and multiple gland hyperplasia were investigated in these patients. Age, gender, imaging results, serum calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations were analyzed and compared to the data of 50 randomly-selected, PHTP patients with solitary adenomas.6.6% and 2.4% of the patients with sporadic PHTP had double adenomas and multiple gland hyperplasia, respectively. The female/male ratio was 4.8 (38/8) and 1.8 (11/6), and the average age was 63 and 52 yrs for patients with double adenomas and multiple gland hyperplasia, respectively. The patients with solitary adenomas had a female/male ratio of 3.5, and an average age of 60 yrs. There were no significant differences in serum calcium or parathyroid hormone concentrations between patients with multiglandular disease and those with solitary adenomas.Multiglandular disease occurs in 9% of patients with sporadic PHTP, and cannot be excluded before surgery. This incidence must be considered when using minimally invasive techniques for treatment of sporadic PHTP. In cases of multiglandular disease, bilateral cervical exploration is indicated.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765822","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.737012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.397909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.288552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.214415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.198926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Primary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
