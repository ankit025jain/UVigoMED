{"id":68919,"title":"Seminal-sparing cystectomy: technical evolution and results over a 20-year period.","abstract":"To demonstrate the oncologic and functional results of seminal-sparing cystectomy (SSC) in patients with bladder cancer (BC) and to describe the evolution of our surgical technique over a 20-year period.From 1990 to 2009 we performed SSC in 88 patients with non-muscle-invasive BC and in 10 patients with muscle-invasive BC away from the bladder neck. Sixty-one of the 98 patients (1990-2002) underwent cystoadenomectomy with ileocapsuloplasty (ICP), consisting of the anastomosis between the Camey II ileal reservoir and the upper edge of the prostatic capsule. This technique was affected by a relevant percentage of anastomotic stricture (11%). From 2003 to 2009, we performed the endocapsular ileourethral anastomosis (EIUA) in 30 patients, on the basis of the direct anastomosis between the ileal reservoir and the urethral stump inside the prostatic apex. Seven patients were lost to follow-up.After a mean follow-up of 102 months, 81 patients (89%) were alive, and 10 patients (11%) had died (8 of disease progression). Early and late complication rates were 25% and 24%, respectively. Complete daytime continence was obtained in 87 patients (95.6%), and nighttime continence was achieved in 34 patients (37%). In the ICP group, stricture of the prostatic fossa affected 7 patients (11%), whereas no neobladder-urethral anastomosis stricture was noticed in the EIUA group. Normal erectile function was preserved in 87 patients (95.6%).SSC offers good oncologic and functional results in carefully selected patients. EIUA represents an evolution from ICP because EIUA reduces the risk of stenosis.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485363","annotations":[{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.881947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.771894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.734551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.582446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.579805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.438723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.390489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.123825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.039755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Erectile tissue","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_tissue"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Neck of urinary bladder","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_of_urinary_bladder"}]}
