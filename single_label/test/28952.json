{"id":28952,"title":"Risk factors associated with tobacco habits among adolescents: a cross-sectional school-based study.","abstract":"The increase in tobacco use among adolescents in India is fraught with serious public health implications. The knowledge of factors which influence this habit could assist in tackling this problem. Hence, we aimed to determine factors associated with tobacco use among school students.The increase in tobacco use among adolescents in India is fraught with serious public health implications. The knowledge of factors which influence this habit could assist in tackling this problem. Hence, we aimed to determine factors associated with tobacco use among school students.Of the 4786 students, 'current tobacco use' was reported by 197 (4.1%) students; 107 (2.2%) were exclusive smokers, 49 (1%) were exclusive tobacco chewers and 41 (0.9%) used both forms of tobacco. Tobacco use was less frequent among children of white collar than blue collar fathers (p<0.05) and also among children of more educated than less educated mothers (p<0.05). Tobacco use of father, mother, siblings and friends had a significant association with the student's tobacco use. The habits were 10.6-, 6.4-, 3.1- fold higher among students if they bought tobacco for teachers, brothers, father/relatives, respectively. Among tobacco users, 31.5% adopted these habits to refresh themselves, 45.9% preferred smoking outside home and 61% were influenced by actors smoking in films.Socioeconomic status, family and peer influence play an important role in students using tobacco.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758441","annotations":[{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.813027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Peer pressure","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.616275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"India","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Blue-collar worker","weight":0.43631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker"},{"name":"School","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"White-collar worker","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.218354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.189018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Tackle (football move)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"Memory refresh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_refresh"},{"name":"Collar (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_(clothing)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
