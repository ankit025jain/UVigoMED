{"id":35154,"title":"Treadmill training for a child with spina bifida without functional ambulation.","abstract":"To describe and report the effect of an 8-week individualized, progressive, treadmill training program on the ambulatory ability of a 4-year-old child with myelomeningocele without functional ambulation.Heart rate and speed on the 2-minute walk test (2MWT) were used to individualize training. Ambulatory outcome measures taken at baseline, postintervention, and 6 weeks postintervention included the 2MWT and the Timed \"Up and Go\" (TUG). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Index was used to measure functional mobility. Improvements were noted in ambulatory ability after training (2MWT, 64.10%; TUG, 34.66%) and at the 6-week follow-up (2MWT, 58.97%; TUG, 34.24%). The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Index showed no significant difference.Use of an individualized treadmill training program may have improved the ambulatory skills of a preschooler with myelomeningocele. More rigorous studies are needed to determine the effects of treadmill training with the spina bifida population and identify optimal training parameters.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675133","annotations":[{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.16068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.129647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Spina bifida","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Go (game)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Spina (Roman circus)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_(Roman_circus)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Treadmill","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill"}]}
