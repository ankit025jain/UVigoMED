{"id":35153,"title":"Combined orthognathic distraction procedure: Le Fort I maxillary osteotomy and mandibular curvilinear distraction osteogenesis. A new technique for craniofacial management.","abstract":"Dentofacial deformities are traditionally treated by maxillary and mandibular osteotomies conducted separately or simultaneously. Recently, distraction osteogenesis has become an irreplaceable part of the surgical armamentarium, for its ability to induce new bone formation between the surfaces of bone segments that are gradually separated by incremental traction, along with a simultaneous expansion of the surrounding soft-tissue envelope. The aim of this article is to describe a combined surgical technique consisting of simultaneous maxillary Le Fort I advancement and mandibular surgical repositioning by means of bilateral sagittal split osteotomy with a curvilinear distractor based on a preliminary computerized presurgical prediction.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675190","annotations":[{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.782628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.561919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Distraction osteogenesis","weight":0.515674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction_osteogenesis"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.353232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Envelope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Distraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction"},{"name":"Curvilinear coordinates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates"}]}
