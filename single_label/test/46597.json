{"id":46597,"title":"Small bowel obstruction and perforation secondary to primary enterolithiasis in a patient with jejunal diverticulosis.","abstract":"We describe a rare case of small bowel obstruction and perforation secondary to a primary enterolith in an 84-year-old female patient with jejunal diverticulosis. She underwent an emergency laparotomy, small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. Multiple jejunal diverticula and a large stone were identified at the time of operation. Analysis of the stone demonstrated mainly faecal material consistent with a true primary enterolith. A literature search of Medline and PubMed revealed three cases similar to the one described. The pathogenesis and management of enterolithiasis in jejunal diverticular disease is considered.
