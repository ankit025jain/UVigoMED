{"id":34866,"title":"[Use of intracranial translucency measurement in first trimester, beyond spina bifida].","abstract":"The intracranial translucency (IT) is described as echolucid space located in the fetal central nervous system corresponding to the fourth ventricle. Alteration in the first trimester is associated with neural tube defects (NTDs).Describe the technique and normal values of translucency and everything that makes this resourse a useful option in the detection of defects and abnormalities.We conducted an electronic search of the literature registered in: PubMed, Ovid, and ProQuest, between September 2009 and January 2013.It describes technical and normal values, factors affecting measurement, intra and inter-observer variability, regarding the screening and diagnosis of NTDs.The IT should be included in the checklist of valuable structures on 11 to 13 ultrasound; its alteration should be related not just o NTDs but posterior fossa anomalies.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701857","annotations":[{"name":"Spina bifida","weight":0.903253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida"},{"name":"Neural tube","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Neural tube defect","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.54266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Fourth ventricle","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_ventricle"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.136513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"First trimester","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_trimester"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0808391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Ovid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid"},{"name":"ProQuest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProQuest"},{"name":"Posterior cranial fossa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cranial_fossa"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Smoke detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector"},{"name":"Checklist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Alteration (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alteration_(album)"},{"name":"Spina (Roman circus)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_(Roman_circus)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
