{"id":77498,"title":"Sleep and circadian rhythm regulation in early Parkinson disease.","abstract":"Sleep disturbances are recognized as a common nonmotor complaint in Parkinson disease but their etiology is poorly understood.To define the sleep and circadian phenotype of patients with early-stage Parkinson disease.Initial assessment of sleep characteristics in a large population-representative incident Parkinson disease cohort (N=239) at the University of Cambridge, England, followed by further comprehensive case-control sleep assessments in a subgroup of these patients (n=30) and matched controls (n=15).Sleep diagnoses and sleep architecture based on polysomnography studies, actigraphy assessment, and 24-hour analyses of serum cortisol, melatonin, and peripheral clock gene expression (Bmal1, Per2, and Rev-Erb?).Subjective sleep complaints were present in almost half of newly diagnosed patients and correlated significantly with poorer quality of life. Patients with Parkinson disease exhibited increased sleep latency (P?=?.04), reduced sleep efficiency (P?=?.008), and reduced rapid eye movement sleep (P?=?.02). In addition, there was a sustained elevation of serum cortisol levels, reduced circulating melatonin levels, and altered Bmal1 expression in patients with Parkinson disease compared with controls.Sleep dysfunction seen in early Parkinson disease may reflect a more fundamental pathology in the molecular clock underlying circadian rhythms.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687146","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.555926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.533002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Actigraphy","weight":0.434897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actigraphy"},{"name":"University of Cambridge","weight":0.420936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.363159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Molecular clock","weight":0.275845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock"},{"name":"Sleep architecture","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_architecture"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"England","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sleep onset latency","weight":0.173353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_onset_latency"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Eye movement (sensory)","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_(sensory)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"ARNTL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARNTL"},{"name":"PER2","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PER2"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Cambridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
