{"id":76494,"title":"Chinese prescription Kangen-karyu and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix improve age-related oxidative stress and inflammatory response through the PI3K/Akt or MAPK pathways.","abstract":"This study examined whether Kangen-karyu and its crude drug, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix, have a reno-protective effect on the age-related oxidative stress and inflammatory response through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in aged rats. Kangen-karyu or Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix (20 mg/kg body weight/day) was administered orally to old groups of rats for 16 days, and their effects were compared with the vehicle-treated old and young rats. The administration of Kangen-karyu caused a slight decrease in the serum glucose level and a significant decrease in the serum insulin level in the old rats. The increased levels of serum renal functional parameter (urea-nitrogen) and oxidative parameter were significantly reduced by both Kangen-karyu and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix. The old rats exhibited a dysregulation of the protein expression related to insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the kidneys, but Kangen-karyu administration significantly reduced the expression of the inflammatory proteins through the PI3K/Akt pathway. On the other hand, the Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix-treated old rats showed a decrease in the inflammatory cytokines through the MAPK pathway. These results provide important evidence that Kangen-karyu and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix have a pleiotropic effect on the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, showing renoprotective effects against the development of inflammation in old rats. This study provides scientific evidence that Kangen-karyu and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix improve the inflammatory responses via the PI3K/Akt or MAPK pathways in the kidney of old rats.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004887","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Pleiotropy","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.801223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.779432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.52345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.327561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.277966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.25878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
