{"id":62970,"title":"A novel frameshift mutation in exon 4 causing a deficiency of high-molecular-weight kininogen in a patient with splenic infarction.","abstract":"High-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) deficiency is a very rare hereditary disorder. We herein report a case of HMWK deficiency with splenic infarction. The HMWK activity of the proband was markedly decreased (0.9%). Direct sequencing of his HMWK gene showed a homozygous \"TC\" insertion at c523-524 in exon 4. This insertion led to an amino acid substitution, Ser175Ser, resulting in a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon in amino acid 183. Furthermore, the HMWK activity was also reduced in the patient's three children, who exhibited the heterozygous \"TC\" insertion at c523-524 in exon 4. This is the first report of this gene alteration in a patient with HMWK deficiency.
