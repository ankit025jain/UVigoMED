{"id":73028,"title":"Regulation of cell proliferation and migration by p62 through stabilization of Twist1.","abstract":"The selective autophagy substrate p62 serves as a molecular link between autophagy and cancer. Suppression of autophagy causes p62 accumulation and thereby contributes to tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that autophagy deficiency promotes cell proliferation and migration through p62-dependent stabilization of the oncogenic transcription factor Twist1. p62 binds to Twist1 and inhibits degradation of Twist1. In mice, p62 up-regulation promotes tumor cell growth and metastasis in a Twist1-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate that Twist1 is a key downstream effector of p62 in regulation of cell proliferation and migration and suggest that targeting p62-mediated Twist1 stabilization is a promising therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of cancer.
