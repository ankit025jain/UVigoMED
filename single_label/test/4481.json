{"id":4481,"title":"[Programmed cell death: is it only apoptosis?].","abstract":"Recent reports prove the necessity to modify the classical definitions of cell death. The canonical distinction between apoptosis (defined as programed cell death--PCD) and necrosis (gene independent) in no longer scientifically valid. Furthermore, more than one process mediated by intracellular genetic program has been documented, for example programmed necrosis. Diversity in definitions leads to confusion, particularly regarding specific terminology. Here we present the new unified criteria for the evaluation of cell death mechanisms as proposed by the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death in recommendations from 2009 and 2012.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518573","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.694133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.418984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.230914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Nomenclature","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.0224886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Canon (fiction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Zombies in popular culture","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombies_in_popular_culture"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
