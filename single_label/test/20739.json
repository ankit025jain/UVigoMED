{"id":20739,"title":"Lack of efficacy with 1064-nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser for the treatment of onychomycosis: a randomized, controlled trial.","abstract":"Laser therapies have been Food and Drug Administration approved for temporary nail plate clearance; however, there is minimal evidence of their long-term efficacy.We sought to evaluate the clinical and mycological clearance of toenails treated with 1064-nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser versus no treatment.This was a randomized, controlled, single-center trial comparing 2 treatments with 1064-nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser (fluence of 5 J/cm(2), rate of 6 Hz) spaced 2 weeks apart versus no treatment in 27 patients (N = 125 affected nails) with clinical and mycological diagnosis of onychomycosis. At 3 months, patients were assessed with mycological cultures and proximal nail plate measurements. Patients treated with laser were also assessed with proximal nail plate measurements at 12 months.At 3 months, 33% of patients treated with laser achieved a negative mycological culture compared with 20% of the control group (P = .49), and had more proximal nail plate clearance compared with control subjects (0.44 vs 0.15 mm, P = .18), which was not statistically significant. At 12 months, there was no difference in nail plate clearance between laser versus control subjects (0.24 vs 0.15 mm, P = .59).Our study was limited by the small sample size and number of treatments.There was no significant mycological culture or clinical nail plate clearance with 1064-nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser compared with control.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641985","annotations":[{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.82983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.439672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.434368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.254944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.210938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.203229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.128662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Neodymium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium"},{"name":"Onychomycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychomycosis"},{"name":"Fluence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluence"},{"name":"Nail plate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_plate"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1064","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1064"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Engineering tolerance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance"},{"name":"Mycology","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycology"}]}
