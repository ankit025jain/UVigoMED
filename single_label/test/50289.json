{"id":50289,"title":"The production of nitric oxide, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in palmitate-stimulated PBMNCs is enhanced through hyperglycemia in diabetes.","abstract":"We examined nitric oxide (NO), IL-6, and TNF-? secretion from cultured palmitate-stimulated PBMNCs or in the plasma from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2MD) patients or nondiabetic (ND) controls. Free fatty acids (FFA) have been suggested to induce chronic low-grade inflammation, activate the innate immune system, and cause deleterious effects on vascular cells and other tissues through inflammatory processes. The levels of NO, IL-6, TNF-?, and MDA were higher in supernatant of palmitate stimulated blood cells (PBMNC) or from plasma from patients. The results obtained in the present study demonstrated that hyperglycemia in diabetes exacerbates in vitro inflammatory responses in PBMNCs stimulated with high levels of SFA (palmitate). These results suggest that hyperglycemia primes PBMNCs for NO, IL-6, and TNF-alpha secretion under in vitro FFA stimulation are associated with the secretion of inflammatory biomarkers in diabetes. A combined therapy targeting signaling pathways activated by hyperglycemia in conjunction with simultaneous control of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia would be suggested for controlling the progress of diabetic complications.
