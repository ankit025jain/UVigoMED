{"id":36953,"title":"Expression of Eya1 and Six1 is decreased in distal airways of rats with experimental pulmonary hypoplasia.","abstract":"Pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) represents one of the major challenges in neonatal intensive care. Eyes absent 1 (Eya1) and sine oculis homebox 1 (Six1) have been identified as essential components of the gene network that regulates foetal lung development. Eya1 and Six1 are expressed in distal epithelial tips of branching airways as well as in surrounding mesenchymal cells, highlighting their important role during branching morphogenesis. Lungs of Eya1(-/-) and Six1(-/-) knockouts display PH with reduced epithelial branching, appearing to be arrested in the pseudoglandular stage. We hypothesized that Eya1 and Six1 expression is decreased in branching airways of nitrofen-induced PH.Time-mated rats received either nitrofen or vehicle on E9.5. Foetal lungs were dissected on E15.5 and divided into control and nitrofen groups, whereas lungs harvested on E18.5 were divided into controls, PH without CDH [PH(-)], and PH with CDH [PH(+)]. Pulmonary gene expression levels of Eya1 and Six1 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to investigate Eya1 and Six1 protein expression and localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).Relative mRNA expression of Eya1 and Six1 was significantly decreased in PH(-) and PH(+) on E18.5 compared to controls. CLSM confirmed markedly diminished immunofluorescence of Eya1 and Six1 in distal airway epithelium as well as in surrounding mesenchymal cells of nitrofen-induced PH on E18.5 compared to controls.Downregulation of Eya1 and Six1 gene expression in nitrofen-induced PH suggests that decreased Eya1 and Six1 expression during the late pseudoglandular stage may interfere with epithelial branching and distal airway maturation, thus resulting in PH.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
