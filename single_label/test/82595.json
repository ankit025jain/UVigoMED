{"id":82595,"title":"Effectiveness of CRT at measuring the salivary level of bacteria in caries prone children with probiotic therapy.","abstract":"This IRB approved clinical trial was to determine the effect of \"over the counter\" probiotic supplements on the Caries Risk Test- CRT- (Ivoclar) results of the oral microflora in high caries risk children.Sixty subjects 6 to 12 years old with a caries risk assessment (CAMBRA) of moderate to high (caries prone) were evaluated by an analysis of the difference in the salivary levels of pathogenic bacteria (mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli). The subjects were randomly selected by randomizing software and assigned to two diferent Groups. Group A used PerioBalance (Lactobacilli reuteri-CFU of 200 million) lozenges for 28 days. Group B used the EvoraKids (Streptococcus uberis KJ2, Streptococcus oralis KJ3, Streptococcus rattus JH1 45, > or = 100 million) probiotics chewable tablets for 30 days. Salivary samples were collected then incubated for 48 hours for colony counting and ranking. Follow up testing with the CRT was performed after 60 days at a follow up visit.There was a statistically significant diference in the CRT results between the pre and post use of the probiotics. PerioBalance; SM results t= -6. 78, p< .0001, Lactobacilli results t= -5.762, p< .0001, EvoraKids SMresults t= -7.33, p< .0001, Lactobacilli results t= -2.952, p= .0068.The CRT values obtained with caries prone children may be significantly affected by probiotic use. Based on this study's results the following conclusions can be made: Both EvoraKids and PerioBalance affected the CRT results by significantly decreasing the number of S. mutans and lactobacilli present in the salivary samples.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic
