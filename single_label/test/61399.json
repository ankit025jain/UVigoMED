{"id":61399,"title":"Combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin and megestrol acetate for the management of advanced stage or recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium: a phase II study.","abstract":"To determine overall survival (OS), progression-free interval (PFI), and toxicity in patients with advanced stage or recurrent endometrial cancer (EMCA) treated with combination paclitaxel, carboplatin and megestrol acetate.Patients with stage III/IV or recurrent EMCA were enrolled between October 2004 and April 2008 and received paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 6) every 21 days for 6 cycles and megestrol acetate 40 mg orally 4 times daily for up to 5 years. Dose reductions were based on grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity. Survival was calculated from time of study enrollment.A total of 28 patients were evaluable: 21 (75%) patients with stage III/IV disease and 7 (25%) with recurrent disease. Three patients with recurrence received prior radiation. Mean PFI was 40.2 months (29.7-50.6). Mean OS was 50.1 months (41.5-58.7). After a median 40.4 months (range, 5.6-68.4) of follow-up, 13 patients (46%) had no evidence of disease, 4 were alive with disease, and 10 were dead of disease. One patient died without evidence of disease. Twenty-three patients (82%) completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Ten patients experienced a dose reduction. Myelosuppression was common, with 22 patients (78%) experiencing grade 3/4 neutropenia and 6 patients (21%) experiencing grade 3/4 anemia. Three patients had a deep vein thrombosis. One patient experienced a pulmonary thromboembolus.Combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin and megestrol acetate demonstrates activity. Myelosuppression is common but can be managed with colony-stimulating factors. The addition of hormonal therapy to cytotoxic chemotherapy may improve survival.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724218","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Carboplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboplatin"},{"name":"Megestrol","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megestrol"},{"name":"Bone marrow suppression","weight":0.903768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_suppression"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.823615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.674188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.644358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.499888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.476917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.46518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
