{"id":61038,"title":"[Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia - 20-year treatment results at TYKS].","abstract":"Approximately 30 cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) emerge in Finland yearly. In literature 35 to 40% of those under the age of 60 are reported to recover from their illness. Of the 67 adult ALL patients treated at the Turku University Hospital from 1990 to 2010, 96% achieved remission. The five-year survival rate was 53%. After remission, an allogeneic stem cell transplant was performed for 22 patients (37%), with 38 patients (63%) continuing on cytotoxic drugs. There was no difference in survival between modes of treatment or risk groups.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772789","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.75392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.753322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.729747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.589692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.49771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.489611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Turku","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turku"},{"name":"TYKS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYKS"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
