{"id":60431,"title":"Gastrointestinal Erdheim-Chester disease.","abstract":"We report a rare case of Erdheim-Chester Disease, a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A 60-year old female presented with a seven-month history of vague abdominal symptoms. A large retroperitoneal mass was detected on computed tomography (CT), but multiple CT-guided biopsy samples were inconclusive. Laparoscopy revealed a mass in the distal ileum, which was resected. Histology and immuno-histochemistry supported a diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester Disease.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908861","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.742055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.648987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.248388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Histiocytosis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocytosis"}]}
