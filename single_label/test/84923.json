{"id":84923,"title":"Blunted exercise-induced mobilization of monocytes in somatization syndromes and major depression.","abstract":"Previous research indicates that physical activity may alter the number of immune cells. We examined whether increasing or decreasing the level of physical activity affects circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts in patients with somatization syndromes and patients with major depression.Thirty-eight participants with major depression, 26 participants with somatization syndromes and 47 healthy controls participated in the study. Using an experimental within-subject design, participants were involved in 1 week of increased physical activity (daily exercise sessions) and 1 week of reduced physical activity. Counts of total lymphocytes, lymphocyte subsets and monocytes were determined before and after each trial. Linear mixed models adjusted for sex, body mass index, age, fitness status and the order of trials were used for longitudinal data analysis.One week of exercise increases the number of monocytes in healthy controls (p<.05), but not in patients with somatization syndromes or patients with major depression. In addition, after 1 week of exercise, depressive symptoms were reduced in patients with major depression (p<.05) while somatoform symptoms were reduced (p<.05) in both clinical groups. Baseline comparisons and mixed models indicated reduced T helper cell counts in patients with somatization syndromes.Relatively small sample size. The time of physical activity was relatively short and restricted to low-graded exercise.This study demonstrates a blunted mobilization of monocytes by exercise in both patients with somatization syndromes and patients with major depression. In addition, even one week of exercise reduces somatoform and depressive symptoms.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012425","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.895726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.86647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.566474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.547072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.440443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.417786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Somatization","weight":0.381279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.355971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Somatoform disorder","weight":0.292779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatoform_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.201829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0251131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
