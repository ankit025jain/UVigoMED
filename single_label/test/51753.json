{"id":51753,"title":"Successful treatment of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults with traditional Chinese medicine: a case report.","abstract":"Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is regarded as one of the Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that progress slowly. It gradually became understood since 1970s. The onset usually appears in adulthood, the islet autoantibodies are positive and the function of beta cell is declined rapidly.The treatment is insulin injection.The case reported followed is a 37-year-old male patient who was newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He abandoned oral hypoglycemic agents since they caused stomach indisposed. Before visiting, his islet autoantibodies were detected positive and he had never injected insulin before. We treated him with traditional Chinese herbals under the guidance of Traditional Chinese Medicine and differentiation, and achieved fine efficacy.Because the initial presentation of LADA is similar to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and examination is not in common use, misdiagnosis is not rare. Once LADA is diagnosed, the therapy must be adjusted. This case report indicated that Traditional Chinese Medicine might be an alternative treatment for LADA.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660609","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Beta cell","weight":0.713983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_cell"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.609335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"China","weight":0.434076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.284399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Latent autoimmune diabetes","weight":0.278282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.196702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
