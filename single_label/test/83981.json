{"id":83981,"title":"[Discrepancy in the length of smoking cessation between surgeon's and anesthesiologist's records in relation to hypoxia during one-lung ventilation].","abstract":"Smoking cessation before pulmonary surgery is essential for preventing respiratory complications associated with operation and anesthesia. We compared patients' smoking habits and length of smoking cessation based on respiratory surgeon's and anesthesiologist's records.We retrospectively surveyed 68 patients who underwent elective operation under one-lung ventilation (OLV) with respect to the Brinkmann index, smoking cessation period, and incidence of hypoxia during OLV.Of the 68 patients, 38 had a history of smoking, with no difference in the Brinkmann index according to respiratory surgeons and anesthesiologists. Of the 38 patients, 6 had inconsistent records regarding the length of smoking cessation. The smoking cessation period was significantly longer according to respiratory surgeons (17.5 days (median)) compared to that according to anesthesiologists [2.0 days (median), P < 0.05). The incidence of hypoxia (SP(O2) < 90%) was significantly higher in these patients (4 of 6), relative to those with no discrepancy (2 of 32, P < 0.05).Accurate information regarding the length of smoking cessation before surgery is difficult to obtain. The incidence of hypoxia during OLV was significantly higher in patients with a discrepancy regarding the length of smoking cessation between respiratory surgeon's and anesthesiologist's records.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199337","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.833135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.619125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.588323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.352681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Brinkmann","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkmann"},{"name":"Serbian Renewal Movement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Renewal_Movement"},{"name":"Philippine National Police","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_National_Police"}]}
