{"id":70516,"title":"[Metabolic tailoring in radiotherapy for head and neck cancer].","abstract":"Radiotherapy based on functional imaging consists to deliver a heterogeneity dose based on biological proprieties. This approach is termed biologically conformal radiotherapy or dose painting with biological target volume inside the gross tumor volume. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI can also be used to define a specific biological target volume. Three main tracers are used: ((18)F)-fluorodeoxyglucose to target the hypermetabolism, ((18)F)-fluoromizonidazole and ((18)F)- fluoroazomycin arabinoside to target areas of hypoxia. In this review, we give a practical approach to achieving a treatment-guided radiotherapy molecular and the main issues raised by this imaging technique. Despite the provision of all the technological tools to the radiotherapist, this new therapeutic approach is still evaluated in clinical studies to demonstrate a real clinical benefit compared to radiotherapy based on anatomic imaging.
