{"id":89796,"title":"Arthroscopic Bankart repair using knot-tying versus knotless suture anchors: is there a difference?","abstract":"To compare the clinical outcome between the use of knotless sutures versus knot-tying sutures in arthroscopic Bankart repairs.Between January 2007 and January 2011, 87 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with the use of knot-tying suture anchors or knotless suture anchors were evaluated, with 45 patients in the knot-tying suture group and 42 patients in the knotless group. Patients were assigned to either group, with odd-numbered patients going to the knot-tying suture arm and even-numbered patients assigned to the knotless arm. Outcomes included the Constant score, the visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, and range of motion in forward flexion and external rotation with the arm in adduction. Redislocations or subluxations with the 2 techniques was also studied.Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and Constant scores. In the knot-tying suture group, the VAS score improved from 2.5 ± 2.3 to 0.7 ± 0.5 (P < .05) and the Constant score improved from 64 ± 7 to 92 ± 10 (P < .05). In the knotless group, the VAS score improved from 2.8 ± 2.5 to 0.9 ± 0.6 (P < .05), and the Constant score improved from 62 ± 6 to 89 ± 9 (P < .05). The patient satisfaction scores were 6.9 and 7.1 for the knot tying and knotless groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups. The change in the range of forward flexion and external rotation was also similar in the 2 groups. There was also no difference in recurrence or redislocation rates.Both the knot-tying and knotless suture anchors groups showed statistically significant and similar improvement in VAS and Constant scores. Both anchors provided reasonable outcomes. The knotless suture anchor is a good alternative to knot-tying suture anchors so that arthroscopic Bankart repairs can be performed without knot tying.Level II, prospective comparative study.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680302","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.332137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.209202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.205812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.148761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0861791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Knot tying","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_tying"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
