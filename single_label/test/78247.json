{"id":78247,"title":"Changing trends of speech outcomes after total laryngectomy in the 21st century: a single-center study.","abstract":"To describe the speech rehabilitation outcomes of patients undergoing total laryngectomy (TL) in the 21st century.Retrospective chart review.Tertiary academic centerRetrospective review of 167 patients who underwent TL from June 2000 to February 2012. Demographics, disease variables, and surgical factors were reviewed. Primary alaryngeal speech modality, speech outcome, and tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) complication rates were assessed.Overall TEP speech success rate (primary or secondary) was 72%. Overall TEP speech success rate was 76% for those with primary TEP and was 68% for those with secondary TEP. TEP speech success rates at first, second, and beyond second year were 75%, 72%, and 70%, respectively. Success rates for primary TL, salvage TL, primary TL with pharyngeal reconstruction, or salvage TL with pharyngeal reconstruction groups were 71%, 72%, 73%, and 71%, respectively. TEP-related complications occurred in 43% of patients, with no difference in complication rates between primary versus salvage TL or primary versus secondary TEP. For those with complications, TEP success rate was 65%.This study showed TEP speech-outcome success rates lower than what has been historically reported. There was no significant difference in TEP speech outcome between primary versus salvage TL or primary versus secondary TEP. Patients with TEP-related complications had TEP speech-outcome success rates comparable to those without any complication. TEP may continue to be a superior option as a mode of speech in patients with TL, including those undergoing salvage TL.4.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729127","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.338155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Historical martial arts reconstruction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_martial_arts_reconstruction"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Tracheo-oesophageal puncture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheo-oesophageal_puncture"},{"name":"Alaryngeal speech","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaryngeal_speech"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Real options valuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_options_valuation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"TV and FM DX","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_and_FM_DX"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"21st century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century"},{"name":"Fish measurement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_measurement"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
