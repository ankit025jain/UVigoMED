{"id":53380,"title":"Association of GCK -30G> a polymorphism with gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk: a meta-analysis involving 18 case-control studies.","abstract":"Several studies have examined the association between the GCK -30G>A polymorphism and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, inferences from these studies are hindered by their limited statistical power and conflicting results. The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide a relatively comprehensive picture of the association of the GCK -30G>A polymorphism with GDM and T2DM risk.A literature search for eligible studies published before August 15, 2013, was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure). Pooled odds ratios with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the strength of the association under a fixed- or random-effect model according to heterogeneity test results. All analyses were performed using Stata software, version 12.0.Eighteen case-control studies from 17 published reports were included in this meta-analysis with a total of 2011 patients with GDM, 11,057 with T2DM, and 26,102 healthy controls. For GDM, the combined results showed that the risk allele of the -30G>A polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of GDM. Stratified analyses showed that the magnitude of the effect was especially significant among whites, indicating ethnicity differences for GDM susceptibility. For T2DM, the pooled ORs were not significant in the overall population, although all the ORs >1 suggested an increased risk of T2DM for carriers of the A allele. However, whites seem to be significantly more susceptible to T2DM than Asians.This meta-analysis indicated that the risk allele of the GCK -30G>A polymorphism may increase GDM and T2DM risk in whites, whereas additional studies are needed to confirm the effect of this polymorphism on both diseases in Asians and Africans.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System
