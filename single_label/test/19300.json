{"id":19300,"title":"Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of a Schiff base derived from cephalexin and sulphathiazole and its transition metal complexes.","abstract":"Metal(II) coordination compounds of a cephalexin Schiff base (HL) derived from the condensation of cephalexin antibiotic with sulphathiazole were synthesized. The Schiff base ligand, mononuclear [ML(OAc)(H2O)2] (M(II)=Mn, Co, Ni, Zn) complexes and magnetically diluted trinuclear copper(II) complex [Cu3L(OH)5] were characterized by several techniques, including elemental and thermal analysis, molar conductance and magnetic susceptibility measurements, electronic, FT-IR, EPR and (1)H NMR spectral studies. The analytical and molar conductance values indicated that the acetate ions coordinate to the metal ions. The Schiff base ligand HL behaves as a monoanionic tridentate NNO and tetradentate NNOO chelating agent in the mono and trinuclear complexes respectively.
