{"id":55174,"title":"Visual impairment and blindness due to macular diseases globally: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"To estimate the number of people visually impaired or blind due to macular diseases except those caused by diabetic maculopathy.Meta-analysis.Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 and ongoing literature research, we examined how many people were affected by vision impairment (presenting visual acuity <6/18, ?3/60) and blindness (presenting visual acuity <3/60) due to macular diseases, with diabetic maculopathy excluded.In 2010, of 32.4 million blind people and 191 million vision-impaired people, 2.1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.9, 2.7) people were blind, and 6.0 million (95% UI: 5.2, 8.1) million were visually impaired due to macular diseases. In 2010, macular diseases caused 6.6% (95% UI: 6.0, 7.9) of all blindness and 3.1% (95% UI: 2.7, 4.0) of all vision impairment, worldwide. These figures were lower in regions with young populations than in high-income regions. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people who were blind or visually impaired due to macular diseases increased by 36%, or 0.6 million people (95% UI: 0.5, 0.8) and by 81%, or 2.7 million (95% UI: 2.6, 3.9) people, respectively, whereas the global population increased by 30%. Age-standardized global prevalence of macula-related blindness and vision impairment in adults 50 years of age and older decreased from 0.2% (95% UI: 0.2, 0.2) in 1990 to 0.1% (95% UI: 0.1, 0.2) in 2010 and remained unchanged from 0.4% (95% UI: 0.3, 0.5) to 0.4% (95% UI: 0.4, 0.6), respectively.In 2010, 2.1 million people were blind and 6.0 million people were visually impaired due to macular diseases, except those caused by diabetic maculopathy. Of every 15 blind people, 1 was blind due to macular disease, and of every 32 visually impaired people, 1 was visually impaired due to macular disease.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973605","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.734693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.726851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.375355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.290279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"618","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/618"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"2010 Winter Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics"},{"name":"Global burden of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_burden_of_disease"},{"name":"Xbox 360","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Burden, Kansas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden,_Kansas"},{"name":"Maculopathy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopathy"}]}
