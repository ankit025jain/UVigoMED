{"id":83777,"title":"Efficacy of desvenlafaxine succinate for menopausal hot flashes.","abstract":"The concern for the development of breast cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease and deep venous thrombosis with the use of hormonal therapy has led to the development of alternative nonhormonal forms of therapy like desvenlafaxine for the management of hot flashes.This review is based upon a PubMed search and clinical trials. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of desvenlafaxine are reviewed. This review outlines the effects of desvenlafaxine in management of severity and frequency of vasomotor symptoms, sleep quality and quality of life in postmenopausal women. The potential adverse effects of desvenlafaxine are summarized.Based on the evidence from randomized clinical trials, desvenlafaxine is an alternate viable option for reducing the frequency and severity of hot flashes when other treatments fail. In clinical trials, it has been shown that desvenlafaxine reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 55 - 69%. In the trials so far it appears to have good safety and tolerability profile when the drug is initiated in titrating doses. The optimum dose is 100 mg/day and is to be started at 50 mg/day for 3 days and titrated to 100 mg/day. The most common adverse events reported were nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, constipation, diarrhea and somnolence.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252697","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.880265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.877613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Hot flash","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_flash"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.772987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.716365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.699639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.68777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.665606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.558272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.545523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.531276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Desvenlafaxine","weight":0.379167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desvenlafaxine"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.22493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Vasomotor","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasomotor"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
