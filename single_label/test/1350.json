{"id":1350,"title":"[Impact of isolated diastolic hypertension on new-onset cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular diseases].","abstract":"To explore the impact of isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) on new-onset cardio-cerebral vascular diseases (CVD).This cohort study involved 101 510 participants who were employees of the Kailuan Group-a state-run coal mining company, in 2006 and 2007. Among them, 6 780 subjects were diagnosed with IDH, 35 448 subjects were diagnosed with high-normal blood pressure and 19 460 subjects were diagnosed with normal tension. However, none of them had the history of either cardio-cerebral vascular disease or malignant cancer. Cardio-cerebral vascular events including cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction were recorded every 6 months during the follow-up (47.1 Â± 4.8) period. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the risk factors of first-ever CVD events.1) There were 675 CVD events occurred during the follow-up period. The incidence rates of CVD events (1.7% vs. 0.9%), cerebral infarction (1.0% vs. 0.6%) and cerebral hemorrhage (0.4% vs. 0.1%) were significantly higher in IDH group than that in the normal tension group (all P < 0.05). 2) After adjustment for other established CVD risk factors, the hazards ratios became 1.67 (95% CI: 1.28-2.17) for total CVD events and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.12-2.27) for cerebral infarction and 2.67 (95% CI: 1.54-4.65) for cerebral hemorrhage in the IDH group. 3). In stratified analysis on age, after adjustment for other established CVD risk factors, the hazards ratio was 2.22 (95% CI: 1.41-3.50) for cerebral infarction in lower 60 years old group, while the it was 7.27 (95% CI: 2.58-20.42) for cerebral hemorrhage in groups older than 60 years of age.IDH was the independent risk factor for the total cardio-cerebral vascular events, on both cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage. The predicted values of IDH for different CVD events were diverse on different age groups.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25376691","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral infarction","weight":0.895066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.635141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cerebral hemorrhage","weight":0.630688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.47558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.46932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.463327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.404832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.337841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.276266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.149224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.121401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Coal mining","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Coal","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal"}]}
