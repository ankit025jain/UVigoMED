{"id":52354,"title":"Improvement of specific detection of circulating tumor cells using combined CD45 staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization.","abstract":"Conventional cytokeratin (CK)-based methods to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) often present suboptimal sensitivities for decreased or non-expression of cytokeratin in some CTCs. We clinically investigated a new method that combines immunocytochemistry staining (ICC) of CD45 and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Circulating epithelial cells from 141 subjects were enriched using an EpCAM-independent strategy and then identified by either a combination of FISH with chromosome 8 centromere probe (CEP8) and ICC staining of CD45 (CD45-FISH) or ICC staining of CK.For detecting CTCs enriched from lung cancers, CD45-FISH had larger areas under ROC curves of 0.963 (P=0.000) compared to ICC (0.653; P=0.031) using cut-off values of 2 and 1 cell/3.75ml blood with sensitivities of 83.3% and 43.3%, specificities of 98.6% and 89.5%, respectively. Moreover, CD45-FISH showed 76.2% sensitivity in detecting CTCs in ovarian cancers (P<0.001). Four of six ovarian cancers showed dramatical decrease in both CTCs and serum CA125 on the 7th day after surgery.CD45-FISH method had improved sensitivity and specificity in detecting CTCs of lung and ovarian cancers compared to ICC-CK. This combined detection strategy may be useful in detecting or monitoring CTCs after ovarian cancer surgery.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607330","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.822493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.761351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.701587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Cytokeratin","weight":0.692243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokeratin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chromosome 8 (human)","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_8_(human)"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.380273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.144691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.117191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
