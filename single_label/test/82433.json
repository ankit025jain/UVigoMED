{"id":82433,"title":"Assessment of quality of life in patients with chronic oral mucosal diseases: a questionnaire-based study.","abstract":"A validated discipline-specific questionnaire has been developed recently to assess the quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic oral mucosal diseases.Use the Chronic Oral Mucosal Diseases Questionnaire for evaluating a diverse group of patients with chronic oral mucosal disease after therapy.Prospective convenience sample.Quality of life.Seventy patients seen in the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with oral lichen planus, recurrent aphthous ulcers, pemphigus, and other chronic oral mucosal diseases were included in the study. Patients completed the questionnaire after undergoing treatment of their oral mucosal disease to assess their QOL.Patients older than age 35 years reported significantly lower QOL (p = 0.015) in the domain of social and emotional status. Significant age-related differences in QOL were not observed in other domains. Older individuals also reported a significantly lower overall QOL. Men reported significantly better oral health-related QOL than women did in pain and functional limitation: 16.14 ± 8.94 vs 21.44 ± 7.696, respectively (p = 0.010). Significant differences were not observed between sexes for other domains. Significant differences were observed between the disease groups only for recurrent aphthous ulcers and pemphigus (p = 0.005). Patients with pemphigus had the worst overall QOL (73.6 ± 5.6).Even after treatment, chronic oral mucosal diseases negatively affect patients’ QOL. Use of the Chronic Oral Mucosal Diseases Questionnaire may allow physicians to more effectively care for their patients with these diseases.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626087","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.679258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.544231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.540779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.527635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.517413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.455173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mucosal lichen planus","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosal_lichen_planus"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0483347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Aphthous ulcer","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_ulcer"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Pemphigus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigus"},{"name":"Lichen","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"},{"name":"Lichen planus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_planus"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
