{"id":84385,"title":"[Clinical study on primary osteoporosis treated with spreading moxibustion for warming yang and activating blood circulation].","abstract":"To observe the efficacy on primary osteoporosis treated with spreading moxibustion for warming yang and activating blood circulation so as to provide the effective clinical therapeutic methods for osteoporosis.Sixty cases of primary osteoporosis were randomized into a spreading moxibustion group (30 cases) and a calcium tablet group (30 cases). In the calcium tablet group, caltrate was prescribed for oral administration, 600 mg per day. In the spreading moxibustion group, on the basis of the treatment as the calcium tablet group, the spreading moxibustion was applied at Dazhui (GV 14) to Yaoshu (GV 2) for warming yang and activating blood circulation. The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, TCM clinical symptom score and bone mineral density (BMD) were observed and compared before and after treatment in the patients between the two groups.VAS scores were reduced apparently after treatment in the two groups (both P < 0.01) and the results in the spreading moxibustion group were obviously superior to that in the calcium tablet group (2.36 +/- 0.43 vs 4.52 +/- 0.35, P < 0.01). BMD were all increased in the two groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) and the results in the spreading moxibustion group were superior to those in the calcium tablet group (both P < 0.05). The total clinical effective rate was 86.67% (26/30) in the spreading moxibustion group, apparently better than 63.33% (19/30) in the calcium tablet group (P < 0.05). TCM clinical symptom scores after treatment were all reduced apparently in the two groups (both P < 0.01), and the result in the spreading moxibustion group was obviously superior to that in the calcium tablet group (4.72 +/- 1.90 vs 6.82 +/- 2.30, P < 0.01). The total effective rate of TCM symptoms was 93.33% (28/30) in the spreading moxibustion group, apparently better than 70.00% (21/30) in the calcium tablet group (P < 0.05).The combined therapy of spreading moxibustion for warming yang and activating blood circulation and the oral administration of caltrate apparently relieves pain and TCM clinical symptoms, improves BMD in the patients of osteoporosis and achieves definite clinical efficacy in the patients of osteoporosis.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112087","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.747018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.738373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.730927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.666088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.528154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.435087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.268356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.194654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"22nd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_century_BC"},{"name":"27th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_century_BC"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
