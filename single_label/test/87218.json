{"id":87218,"title":"[Fewer cases of decompression sickness in Västra Götaland. Eight years of statistics show a reduced number of consultations and treatments].","abstract":"During the period 2005 to 2012, a total of 340 consultations (phone calls and/or visits) regarding possible decompression illness were recorded at the two hospitals with recompression chambers in the Västra Götaland region, Sweden. An analysis of the data showed a trend towards fewer consultations and recompression treatments. A similar trend has been observed in many other countries. Possible reasons for this reduction in the number of cases are discussed. Most of the patients only present relatively mild signs and symptoms at the time of consultation. This, together with the fact that the number of patients is low, involves a risk that awareness and knowledge regarding correct handling and care in diving accidents might be lost. Since rapid and correct care of decompression illness is important to avoid later sequeale it is important that competence in diving medicine is maintained at hospitals Nationwide.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25606654","annotations":[{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.642742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.320456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Diving","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Diving medicine","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Decompression illness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_illness"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Post-hoc analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hoc_analysis"},{"name":"Diving hazards and precautions","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_hazards_and_precautions"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Bicameralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"},{"name":"Decompression stop","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_stop"}]}
