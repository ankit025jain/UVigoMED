{"id":50421,"title":"Breast-feeding and maternal risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective study and meta-analysis.","abstract":"We aimed to examine the association between breast-feeding and maternal risk of type 2 diabetes and to investigate whether this association is mediated by anthropometric and biochemical factors.A case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam Study between 1994 and 2005 including 1,262 childbearing women (1,059 in a random sub-cohort and 203 incident cases) mainly aged between 35 and 64 years at baseline was applied. Self-reported lifetime duration of breast-feeding was assessed by questionnaire. Blood samples were used for biomarker measurement (HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, C-reactive protein, fetuin-A, ?-glutamyltransferase, adiponectin). A systematic literature search and meta-analysis was conducted of prospective cohort studies investigating breast-feeding and risk of type 2 diabetes.The HR for each additional 6 months of breast-feeding was 0.73 (95% CI 0.56, 0.94) in EPIC-Potsdam. Meta-analysis of three previous prospective studies and the current study revealed an inverse association between breast-feeding duration and risk of diabetes (pooled HR for lifetime breast-feeding duration of 6-11 months compared with no breast-feeding 0.89; 95% CI 0.82, 0.97). Adjustment for BMI and waist circumference attenuated the association (HR per six additional months in EPIC-Potsdam 0.80; 95% CI 0.61, 1.04). Further controlling for potentially mediating biomarkers largely explained this association (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.68, 1.16).Longer duration of breast-feeding may be related to a lower risk of diabetes. This potentially protective effect seems to be reflected by a more favourable metabolic profile; however, the role of body weight as a mediator or confounder remains uncertain.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789344","annotations":[{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.866004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.843035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition","weight":0.641196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Prospective_Investigation_into_Cancer_and_Nutrition"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
