{"id":89270,"title":"A comparative and retrospective study of three hundred and twenty primary Charnley type hip replacements with a minimum follow up of ten years to assess whether a dual mobility cup has a decreased dislocation risk.","abstract":"Mid- and long-term follow-up of Charnley total hip arthroplasty (THA) demonstrated good functional results with 85 % survivorship at 25-year follow-up. However, dislocation still remains an unsolved problem. Dislocation may occur throughout the patient's and implant's life. The aim of this study is to answer the question: does a dual mobility cup (DMC) decrease the dislocation risk?We report comparative results at ten years of follow-up of two groups of primary cemented Charnley-type THA, one with a standard polyethylene cup (group 1, n?=?215) and the other one with a DMC (group 2, n?=?105).In group 1, 26 dislocations (12.9 %) occurred. In group 2 only one dislocation (0.9 %) occurred. This dislocation was successfully reduced by closed reduction, without any recurrence. This difference was statistically significant (p?=?0.0018). In group 1, the reason for revision was recurrent dislocation in 21 cases. Five patients were revised for other reasons. The global revision rate was 12.9 %. In group 2, two patients needed revision surgery for aseptic loosening. The global revision rate was 2.1 %. This difference was statistically significant (p?=?0.054). The goal was reached for the patients of group 2 who had more risks factors for dislocation (age, aetiology, American Society of Anesthesiologists and Devane scores) than those of group 1.When using a DMC, we observed a low rate of dislocation in primary THA (0.9 %). This surgical choice seems to be a safe and effective technique in Charnley-type THA, especially in a high-risk population.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737147","annotations":[{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.774529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.535303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.527867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.437859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.424734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.069656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0561316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
