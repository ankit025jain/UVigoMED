{"id":77571,"title":"[Occupational skin disease].","abstract":"Occupational skin diseases are very common. Its clinical manifestation varies from erythema in a limited area (e.g. hand eczema in hair dressers) to anaphylaxy shock induced by insect bites. In 2007, the on line registration system for occupational skin diseases named \"Occupational Skin Disease NAVI\" [http://www.research12.jp/hifunavi/] was launched by Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health to systematically gather clinical information of each case with occupational skin disease. Registered users can search similar clinical cases from this database by setting a keyword. Moreover, they can gather chemical information of more than 1,300 compounds and references on occupational skin diseases.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605526","annotations":[{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.863895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Insect","weight":0.822156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.498222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.243345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Environmental health","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_health"},{"name":"Insect bites and stings","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_bites_and_stings"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Cheminformatics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheminformatics"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"}]}
