{"id":19052,"title":"Intrawound application of vancomycin reduces wound infection after open release of post-traumatic stiff elbows: a retrospective comparative study.","abstract":"With the improvements in wound healing through the use of intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and technical refinements, postoperative elbow infections have become less common but still occur in certain elective elbow surgeries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic application of vancomycin into the operative site to reduce the incidence of infection after the open release of post-traumatic stiff elbows.A retrospective review of 272 such patients during a 4-year period was performed. In the control group (93 patients), simple prophylaxis with standard intravenous antibiotics was performed; in the vancomycin group (179 patients), vancomycin powder was applied directly into the wound before closure along with standard intravenous prophylaxis.After a follow-up of at least 6 months, the control group was found to have 6 infections (6.45%; confidence interval: 2.40%-13.52%) compared with none (0%; confidence interval: 0-2%.04%) in the vancomycin group, which was a statistically significant difference (P = .0027). No adverse effects were documented from the direct use of the vancomycin powder.The local application of vancomycin powder may be a promising means of preventing postoperative elbow infections after elbow release in patients with post-traumatic elbow stiffness.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745317","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.657974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.648543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.560168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.543186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.335519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"272","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/272"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
