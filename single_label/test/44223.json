{"id":44223,"title":"Second harmonic generation imaging distinguishes both high-grade dysplasia and cancer from normal colonic mucosa.","abstract":"Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a novel imaging technology that could provide optical biopsy during endoscopy with advantages over current technology. SHG has the unique ability to evaluate the amount of extracellular matrix collagen protein and its alignment.Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides from colon biopsies (normal, low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and cancer) were examined with SHG imaging. Both signal intensity and collagen fiber alignment were measured. Average intensity per pixel (AIPP) was obtained, and an analyzing polarizer was used to calculate ?, an alignment parameter.The mean AIPP for normal mucosa was 48, LGD was 38, HGD was 42, and malignancy was 123 (p < 0.01). The AIPP ROC curve between malignant versus non-malignant tissue was 0.96 (0.93-0.99). An AIPP value of 60 can differentiate malignancy with 87 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity. The mean ? for normal tissue was 0.490, LGD was 0.379, HGD was 0.345, and cancer was 0.453 (p = 0.013), with a normal tissue mean rank of 6.5 compared to 2.5 for HGD (p = 0.029).SHG signal intensity can differentiate malignant from non-malignant colonic polyp tissue with high sensitivity and specificity. Anisotropic polarization can discern HGD from normal colonic polyp tissue. SHG can thus distinguish both HGD and malignant lesions in an objective numeric fashion, without contrast agents or interpretation skills. SHG could be incorporated into endoscopy equipment to enhance white light endoscopy.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744180","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.70715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.69917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.68984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.665644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.585983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.549582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Second-harmonic generation","weight":0.448912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation"},{"name":"Polarizer","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizer"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.375104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Pixel","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.37057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.316712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Nonlinear optics","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics"},{"name":"Anisotropy","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Harmonic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Objective (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Tensor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor"}]}
