{"id":56408,"title":"Congenital simple hamartoma of the retinal pigment epithelium.","abstract":"Congenital simple hamartoma of the retinal pigment epithelium (CSHRPE) is a rare tumor speculated to arise from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). A case of CSHRPE is presented herein along with the related literature. A healthy 20-year-old Middle-Eastern man was evaluated for an asymptomatic retinal lesion found on routine examination of his left eye. Fluorescein angiogram, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and A and B scan ultrasonography confirmed the suspected clinical diagnosis. For the first time high-definition OCT images are shown, which have an RPE origin for this tumor.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694109","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.778318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.773784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.754943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.729365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.602154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Hamartoma","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartoma"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
