{"id":87355,"title":"Graphic representation of clinical symptoms: a tool for improving detection of subtle fractures on foot radiographs.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to assess changes in accuracy, degree of confidence, and evaluation time in radiography of subtle foot fractures when the text history is supplemented by a graphic indicating the site of pain.Radiographs from 226 foot examinations (three views), including 126 examinations showing one subtle fracture (< 1-mm displacement) and 100 examinations with normal findings were selected. In the first interpretation session, only a text history was given for 112 examinations, and both text and a graphic indicating the site of pain for 114 examinations. Six months later, a graphic and text history were provided for the 112 cases interpreted without a graphic in the first session, and only text was provided for the other 114 cases. Seven radiologists evaluated the study sets. Sensitivity, specificity, degree of confidence (1-10 scale), and mean interpretation time in seconds were calculated.Use of a graphic increased overall sensitivity for any subtle fracture from 67% to 73% (p < 0.001), increased degree of confidence from 8.1 without a graphic to 8.4 with a graphic (p < 0.0001), and decreased the time for interpretation by 6%, from 53 seconds without a graphic to 50 seconds with a graphic (p = 0.006). Specificity changed from 93% without a graphic to 94% with a graphic (p = 0.33). Fractures of the third metatarsal were missed most frequently (74%); this percentage improved to 61% with use of a graphic.A graphic complements the text history by improving sensitivity, degree of confidence, and time for interpretation.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247972","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.574758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.510074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.379473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.343743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.203387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Knowledge representation and reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Third metatarsal bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_metatarsal_bone"}]}
