{"id":53876,"title":"[Blood lipid, glucose and uric acid in people with subclinical hypothyroidism].","abstract":"To investigate the changes of blood lipid, fasting blood glucose and blood uric acid and its clinical significance in people with subclinical hypothyroidism.Body mass index (BMI), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free tetraiodothyronine (FT4), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and uric acid (UA) were measured and compared in 356 people with subclinical hypothyroidism and 331 health people (controls).Compared to the control group, people with subclinical hypothyroidism had higher levels of BMI, TSH, TC, LDL-C, TG, FBG, UA (P < 0.05) and non-significant decrease of HDL-C (P > 0.05). The level of TSH was positively correlated with TC (r = 0.254), LDL-C (r = 0.110), TG (r = 0.218), BMI (r = 0.119) and FBG (r = 0.210) (P < 0.05). The level of HDL-C was not correlated with TSH (P > 0.05).Thyroid dysfunction may have an effect on the metabolism of blood lipid, FBG and UA.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490510","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.81795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.689984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.449135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.428168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
