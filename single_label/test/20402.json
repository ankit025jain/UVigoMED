{"id":20402,"title":"[Helicobacter pylori infection in children: a new focus].","abstract":"Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a high prevalence of chronic infectious pathogens, though not necessarily lead to symptoms, but it can affect the immune system. More than of the world's population harbors the bacterium, and most adult Hp infection was obtained in childhood. Hp infection is a major cause of peptic ulcer, although children rarely suffer from peptic ulcer disease. Hp infection is closely related to chronic gastritis, dyspepsia, chronic diarrhea and recurrent abdominal pain in children. In recent years, Hp infection may also participate in some of non-digestive diseases, such as children's nutritional iron deficiency anemia, growth retardation, malnutrition, autoimmune idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic urticaria, as well as the development of adult atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases and some nervous system diseases. Hp infection can be a lifetime issues of children. Hp infection of children will bring many socio-economic problems. In this paper, the correlation of Hp infection in stomach and oral cavity, and diagnostic technology, prevention as well as treatment strategies for Hp infection will be discussed.
