{"id":60397,"title":"Synergistic defects of different molecules in the cytotoxic pathway lead to clinical familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.","abstract":"Several molecules (LYST, AP3, RAB27A, STX11, STXBP2, MUNC13-4, and PRF1) have been associated with the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Biallelic defects in all of these molecules have been associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). We retrospectively reviewed the genetic and immunology test results from 2701 patients with a clinically suspected diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and found 28 patients with single heterozygous mutations in 2 FHL-associated genes. Of these patients, 21 had mutations within PRF1 and a degranulation gene, and 7 were found to have mutations within 2 genes involved in the degranulation pathway. In patients with combination defects involving 2 genes in the degranulation pathway, CD107a degranulation was decreased, comparable to patients with biallelic mutations in one of the genes in the degranulation pathway. This suggests a potential digenic mode of inheritance of FHL as a result of a synergistic function effect within genes involved in cytotoxic lymphocyte degranulation.
