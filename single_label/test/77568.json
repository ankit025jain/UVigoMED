{"id":77568,"title":"[Mental health problems].","abstract":"This paper describes current issues in occupational mental health, occupational mental health activities currently underway, and priorities to improve the situation in Japan. A new tool to support these activities is then discussed. The incidence of employee mental health problems is rising, despite efforts to promote occupational mental health activities. The adoption of such activities is lagging behind in medium and small-sized enterprises. Priorities to improve occupational mental health include motivating business operators to address mental health issues, focusing more on prevention, and promoting mental health initiatives in medium and small-sized enterprises. Mental-Rosai, a web-based mental health check system, is a useful tool for the prevention of mental health problems and can provide support for medium and small-sized enterprises.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605529","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.219376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.145536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Employee","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Web application","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application"},{"name":"Cheque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheque"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Towamencin Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towamencin_Township,_Montgomery_County,_Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0125579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"}]}
