{"id":71958,"title":"Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured at high density express IFN-? and suppress the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.","abstract":"Although it has been reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suppress tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that type I interferon is expressed in adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) cultured at high density, and ASCs and their conditioned medium (ASC-CM) suppress the growth of MCF-7 cells in vitro. Growth inhibition was amplified by glucose deprivation that resulted from high density culture of ASCs after 3days. The cytotoxic effect of the ASC-CM obtained from high density culture of ASCs was neutralized by anti-IFN-? antibody. STAT1 was phosphorylated in MCF-7 cells treated with ASC-CM, and JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor treatment decreased STAT1 phosphorylation. The cytotoxic effect of ASC-CM was reduced especially by JAK1 inhibitors in MCF-7 cells. Our findings suggest that ASCs cultured at high density express type I interferons, which suppresses tumor growth via STAT1 activation resulting from IFN-? secretion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
