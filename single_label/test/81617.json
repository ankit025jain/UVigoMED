{"id":81617,"title":"In vitro effects of different moisture level and curing method on microleakage of resin cements to pulp chamber dentine.","abstract":"This study evaluated the microleakage of resin cements in the pulp chamber dentin. Fifty specimens of sound human molars were divided into five groups. Composite cores cemented using Clearfil SA Luting in the first group to a dried dentin and in the second group to a moistened dentin and then light-cured. In third and fourth groups, cement was placed on dried and moistened dentin and self-cured respectively. In fifth group, composite cores were cemented by Panavia F2.0. After thermocycling, microleakage was evaluated using fluid filtration technique. The highest microleakage mean value was observed in the group with light-cured to a dry dentin. The mode of curing in contrast to moisture value had significant effect on microleakage. The microleakage of self- adhesive resin cement used in this study was lower in case of self cured than in case of light-cured and was not related to the dentin surface moisture.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922999","annotations":[{"name":"Resin","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.663982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.325809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.272429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Moisture","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Thermal cycler","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_cycler"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Sturmabteilung","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"Normal mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode"},{"name":"Panavia Aircraft GmbH","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavia_Aircraft_GmbH"},{"name":"Cermet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cermet"},{"name":"Dry season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season"},{"name":"Drying","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying"},{"name":"Pressure-sensitive adhesive","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure-sensitive_adhesive"},{"name":"F1 hybrid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid"},{"name":"Curing (chemistry)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"}]}
