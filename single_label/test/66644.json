{"id":66644,"title":"Generation of prostate IMAT plans adaptable to the inter-fractional changes of patient geometry.","abstract":"We present the results of 2-Step generation of adaptable IMAT plans for prostate carcinoma cases. The 2-Step IMAT plans show clinical and dosimetric equivalence to the reference SmartArcâ„¢-generated VMAT plans. The 2-Step plans are adapted to inter-fractional changes of prostate-rectum geometry using 2-Step adaptation rules for a cohort of ten adaptation cases. The adapted 2-Step IMAT plans show statistically significant improvement (Wilcoxon 1-tail p < 0.05) of target coverage and of rectum sparing when compared to isocenter relocated plans.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694541","annotations":[{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.663122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.302861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.130791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"General Certificate of Secondary Education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Vesicular monoamine transporter","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicular_monoamine_transporter"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"}]}
