{"id":88877,"title":"Posterior tension band wiring and instrumentation for thoracolumbar flexion-distraction injuries.","abstract":"To evaluate treatment outcome of tension band wiring followed by posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation for thoracolumbar flexiondistraction injury (FDI).36 men and 12 women aged 21 to 56 (mean, 36) years underwent tension band wiring followed by posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation using pedicular screws for FDI of the thoracolumbar spine. The injured vertebral levels were T11 (n=2), T12 (n=12), T11-T12 (n=1), T12-L1 (n=1), L1 (n=28), and L2 (n=4). Anterior vertebral body height and kyphosis were measured before and after surgery. Neurologic status was assessed using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale. The Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire and visual analogue scale for pain were also used.The mean follow-up was 38 (range, 26-72) months. At final follow-up, the mean visual analogue scale for pain was 1.7, and the median Oswestry Disability Index was 4% (range, 0-32%). The mean anterior vertebral body height improved from 20.5 to 38.8 mm (p<0.001). The mean kyphosis improved from 20.4ยบ to 1.5ยบ (p<0.001). Four patients had persistent neurologic deficit: ASIA scale C (n=2) and D (n=2); their ASIA scales improved by one grade. All patients returned to their original work at 6 months. There were no intra-operative complications or implant failures.Posterior tension band wiring followed by posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation for thoracolumbar FDIs achieved good outcome.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781622","annotations":[{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.848983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Spinal fusion","weight":0.647422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.612257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.429041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Body of vertebra","weight":0.219212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_vertebra"},{"name":"Human height","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Oswestry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswestry"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Electrical wiring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Instrumentation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(music)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"T11 torpedo","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T11_torpedo"}]}
