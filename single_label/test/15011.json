{"id":15011,"title":"Multimodal SPION-CREKA peptide based agents for molecular imaging of microthrombus in a rat myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model.","abstract":"Microthrombosis plays a key role in many cardiovascular diseases. Although it is not difficult to localize thrombus within large or middle-sized vessels, the noninvasive diagnostic regimen for the detection of microthrombus remains scarce. Here we developed a nanoagent by conjucting superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticle with fluorophore and a targeting element, CREKA, a peptide with special affinity for fibrin. In a rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R), the multimodal nanoagents were readily and selectively accumulated within microthrombosis, which was detectable by both magnetic resonance and optical imaging modalities. The fibrin-targeted nanoagent could be expected to have utility not only in molecular imaging of fibrin, understanding the mechanisms of microcirculation disorders, but also in targeted therapy with fibrinolytic agents.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393265","annotations":[{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.804801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.771442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.745858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.63172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.591718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.544884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Molecular imaging","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_imaging"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.289381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.285466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.214742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Superparamagnetism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superparamagnetism"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Chemical affinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_affinity"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Stimulus modality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_modality"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Optical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_imaging"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
