{"id":63825,"title":"Multicenter case series of indolent small/medium-sized CD8+ lymphoid proliferations with predilection for the ear and face.","abstract":"We report 7 cases of a CD8 lymphoid proliferation of the ear and face with a cytotoxic T-cell phenotype, but an indolent clinical course. All patients presented with stable or slowly growing asymptomatic lesions on the ear, nose, or lower eyelid. Histopathology showed a dense diffuse dermal infiltrate of small- to medium-sized atypical lymphocytes without destructive features. The lymphocytes were positive for CD3, CD8, ?-F1, and TIA-1 and negative for CD4, CD30, CD56, granzyme B, and PD-1. Of note, the proliferation index was low in available cases. All patients remained in complete remission at median follow-up of 14 months regardless of treatment modality. Staging was negative for extracutaneous disease in all patients. The clinically indolent behavior and histopathologic phenotype together with a low proliferation index (10%-15%) emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate clinical management to avoid overtreatment and complications of therapy.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24394306","annotations":[{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.747711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.686347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.663999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.534959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.519377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.500111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.498938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.473479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.239429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.155016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"GZMB","weight":0.117191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GZMB"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"CD30","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD30"},{"name":"TIA1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIA1"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Granzyme","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granzyme"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"}]}
