{"id":91768,"title":"Endovascular treatment of the extracranial carotid pseudoaneurysms resulting from stab penetrating injury using overlapping bare stents.","abstract":"Injury pertaining to the common carotid artery may result in complete or partial arterial transection, pseudoaneurysms, or arteriovenous connections. Endovascular treatment option of the pseudoaneurysm has already been established with favorable success rate and minimal morbidity. Our purpose is to report one 18-year-old male patient having 2 traumatic pseudoaneurysms as a result of penetrating stab injury in the extracranial common carotid. The patient was successfully treated using 2 overlapping bare-metal stents. The 2 common carotid pseudoaneurysms had different degree inflow angles defined as the space between the lines indicating the direction of blood flow from the parent artery and through the aneurysmal neck to the dome. Computed tomography angiography was utilized to follow the evolution of the pseudoaneurysms until total occlusion was demonstrated. The treatment modality used in this report represents an alternative approach of the endovascular treatment for the extracranial carotid pseudoaneurysm.
