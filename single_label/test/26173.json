{"id":26173,"title":"Clinical effectiveness of CRT and ICD therapy in heart failure patients by racial/ethnic classification: insights from the IMPROVE HF registry.","abstract":"Clinical trials have demonstrated benefit for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapies in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); yet, questions have been raised with regard to the benefit of device therapy for minorities.The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical effectiveness of CRT and ICD therapies as a function of race/ethnicity in outpatients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ?35%).Data from IMPROVE HF (Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting) were analyzed by device status and race/ethnicity among guideline-eligible patients for mortality at 24 months. Multivariate Generalized Estimating Equations analyses were conducted, adjusting for patient and practice characteristics.The ICD/cardiac resynchronization defibrillator (CRT-D)-eligible cohort (n = 7,748) included 3,391 (44%) non-Hispanic white, 719 (9%) non-Hispanic black, and 3,638 (47%) other racial/ethnic minorities or race-not-documented patients. The cardiac resynchronization pacemaker (CRT-P)/CRT-D-eligible cohort (n = 1,188) included 596 (50%) non-Hispanic white, 99 (8%) non-Hispanic black, and 493 (41%) other/not-documented patients. There was clinical benefit associated with ICD/CRT-D therapy (adjusted odds ratio: 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.52 to 0.79, p = 0.0002 for 24-month mortality), which was of similar proportion in white, black, and other minority/not-documented patients (device-race/ethnicity interaction p = 0.7861). For CRT-P/CRT-D therapy, there were also associated mortality benefits (adjusted odds ratio: 0.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.33 to 0.91, p = 0.0222), and the device-race/ethnicity interaction was not significant (p = 0.5413).The use of guideline-directed CRT and ICD therapy was associated with reduced 24-month mortality without significant interaction by racial/ethnic group. Device therapies should be offered to eligible heart failure patients, without modification based on race/ethnicity.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145524","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.802236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.730052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.649749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Defibrillation","weight":0.625776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.612818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.610055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.605063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.482455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.29037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Cardiac resynchronization therapy","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_resynchronization_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"638","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/638"},{"name":"719","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/719"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Mod (video gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Failure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
