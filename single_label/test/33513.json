{"id":33513,"title":"A cohort study on a ceramide-containing cleanser and moisturizer used for atopic dermatitis.","abstract":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disorder. In this cohort study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a twice-daily regimen of a ceramide-containing cleanser and moisturizer in men, women, and children with AD (N=151). The treatment period was 6 weeks. Participants were evaluated at baseline (day 0) and at the end of treatment (day 42) using clinical photographs, the SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) index, and quality of life (QOL) assessment. Participants were randomly selected and were allocated to 1 of 2 groups: group 1 with participants 12 years and older (n=118) and group 2 with participants younger than 12 years (n=33). At day 42, SCORAD scores for group 1 showed significant improvement (t???=18.33, P=.0001). Skin condition in group 2 was evaluated by the participants' guardians. At day 42, SCORAD scores for group 2 showed significant improvement (t??=5.38, P=.0001). Sim-ilar effects were observed for itching, with scores that improved from very itchy to itching only when the skin was wet (t??=5.38, P=.0001). No adverse events were reported during the 6-week evaluation period. The study results indicate that the ceramide-containing cleanser and moisturizer regimen substantially improved skin condition and clinical outcomes related to AD severity as well as QOL aspects.
