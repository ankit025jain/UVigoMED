{"id":19349,"title":"Evaluation of the diagnostic value of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization in the pediatric leprosy.","abstract":"Leprosy is characterized by a long and variable incubation period and a chronic clinical course. Diagnosis of leprosy is essentially based on clinical features. Although the majority of cases can be diagnosed clinically yet alternative methods for diagnosis are required especially for early cases. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization can be a valuable tool for diagnosis for early cases. The present study is aimed to assess the diagnostic value of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization in cytological specimens and to compare these techniques with Z.N. staining. This prospective study was carried out in 26 patients below 18 years of age of leprosy. Clinical examination of each patient was done and categorized according to IAL. After taking consent, three skin smears was taken, one for Z.N. staining and remaining two for immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization respectively. Routine skin smear examination by Z.N. staining method confirmed the diagnosis in 4/26 (15.83%) and these belonged to BB, BL category. Immunocytochemistry showed positivity in 10/15 (66.6%) in BT and 72.7% in BB/BL leprosy. Immunocytochemistry improved the diagnosis by 53.85%, and the results were statistically significant (p < 0.01). In situ hybridization showed the positive results in 80% cases of BT leprosy and 90.9% cases of BB/BL leprosy. In situ hybridization improved the diagnosis by 70% in comparison to ZN staining and the results were statistically significant (p < 0.01). This study supports that immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization enhance the diagnosis of leprosy when compared to routine skin smears stained by Z.N staining. They are important diagnostictoolsfor definitive diagnosis in early as well as established cases of leprosy.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724232","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.73607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.600907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.406998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Immunocytochemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocytochemistry"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 426","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_426"},{"name":"BT Group","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Group"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"}]}
