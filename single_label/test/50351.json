{"id":50351,"title":"Risks and benefits of statin use in young people with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Despite advances in the management of microvascular complications of T1D, there is a lack of similar progress in reduction of macrovascular complications. Dyslipidemia is one of the major contributory factors for macrovascular complications in T1D, but the literature suggests significant under-treatment of this risk factor in children and adolescents with diabetes. Statins have shown to be both effective and safe in young people with familial hypercholesterolemia and adults with diabetes mellitus, but the role for statins in children and adolescent with T1D remains unclear and controversial. In this review, we will summarize the risks and benefits of statin use in young people with T1D.
