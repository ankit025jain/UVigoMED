{"id":56714,"title":"Exploring the morphological and functional retinal changes after dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex®) in macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion.","abstract":"To explore functional and morphological retinal changes 6 months after dexamethasone intravitreal implant (DEX implant) for the treatment of macular edema due to central or branch retinal vein occlusion (CRVO, BRVO).In this prospective interventional case series patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination at baseline and monthly, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spectral domain-optical coherence tomography and microperimetry. Fluorescein angiography was performed at baseline and at 4 months. All patients were treated with a DEX implant and retreated according to predefined criteria starting from month 4.Sixteen patients (mean age 66 ± 13 years, 14 CRVO, 2 BRVO) were included. At 6 months mean retinal sensitivity improved from 9.7 ± 4.6 to 13.6 ± 5.4 dB (p < 0.0001) while mean BCVA improved from 52.4 ± 16.2 to 66.1 ± 16.6 (p < 0.0001). Mean central retinal thickness decreased from 708.3 ± 151.01 to 362.7 ± 177.4 ?m (p < 0.0001); 56.2% of eyes were retreated at month 4.At 6 months DEX implant led to a significant improvement in retinal sensitivity and visual acuity associated with a reduction of retinal thickness in patients with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642474","annotations":[{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.778698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.684657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.675045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.673121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.531567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.391176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.370858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"362","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/362"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"}]}
