{"id":55813,"title":"Comparative analysis of two femtosecond LASIK platforms using iTRAQ quantitative proteomics.","abstract":"New femtosecond laser platforms may reduce ocular surface interference and LASIK-associated dry eye. This study investigated tear protein profiles in subjects who underwent LASIK using two femtosecond lasers to assess differences in protein expression.This was a randomized interventional clinical trial involving 22 patients who underwent femtosecond laser refractive surgery with a contralateral paired eye design. Corneal flaps of 22 subjects were created by either Visumax or Intralase laser. Tear samples were collected preoperatively, and at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively using Schirmer's strips. Tear protein ratios were calculated relative to preoperative protein levels at baseline. The main outcome measures were the levels of a panel of dry eye protein markers analyzed using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) mass spectrometry.A total of 824 unique proteins were quantifiable. Tear protein ratios were differentially regulated between the eyes treated with different lasers. The secretoglobulins Lipophilin A (1.80-fold) and Lipophilin C (1.77) were significantly upregulated (P < 0.05) at 1 week postoperatively in Visumax but not in Intralase-treated eyes. At 1 week, orosomucoid1 was upregulated (1.78) in Intralase but not Visumax-treated eyes. In the same eyes, lysozyme, cathepsin B, and lipo-oxygenase were downregulated at 0.44-, 0.64-, and 0.64-folds, respectively. Transglutaminase-2 was downregulated in both groups of eyes.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Eye
