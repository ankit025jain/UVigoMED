{"id":87861,"title":"[Short-term curative effect of vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) combined with platelet rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of the refractory wounds].","abstract":"To observe the efficacy of the treatment of refractory wound by VSD combined with platelet-rich plasma.From April 2010 to June 2012,15 patients with refractory wound were treated including 11 males and 4 females with an average age of 35.2 years old ranging from 18 to 45 years old. The formation time of wound was from 6 to 24 months, which was unhealed after long-term medication or repeated treatment. The VSD combined with autologous platelet-rich plasma was applied to treat the wound. The wound healing was an indicator and treatment and clinical features were summarized.All the patients were followed up for 3 to 8 months (means 5 months). The wound of all patients were healed without recurrence.The curative effect of VSD combined with platelet rich plasma for treatment of refractory wounds is obvious. It could reduce the treatment course and the treatment cost.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974432","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.489763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.475244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.393623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Vacuum packing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_packing"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
