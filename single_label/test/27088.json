{"id":27088,"title":"Circulating irisin, omentin-1, and lipoprotein subparticles in adults at higher cardiovascular risk.","abstract":"Muscle and fat are now recognized as metabolism-regulating endocrine organs. However, muscle and adipocyte-derived novel cytokines such as irisin and omentin-1 remain understudied in relation to metabolic biomarkers that are associated with cardiovascular risk.Thirty-nine subjects with mean (± SD) BMI of 29.2 ± 5.4 kg/m(2) and either diabetes or two other cardiovascular risk factors were enrolled in a 6-month randomized trial of low-dose ethanol. We examined cross-sectional data at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month visits to assess (1) within-person stability of novel cytokines (irisin, omentin-1, visfatin, resistin, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II) and (2) their associations with metabolic parameters, particularly lipoprotein subparticle profile.Repeated measures of irisin and omentin-1 were highly correlated, with intra-class correlations of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.91; P < 0.001) and 0.81 (0.70, 0.89; P < 0.001), respectively. Irisin was negatively correlated with omentin-1 (7.4% irisin decrease per a 1-SD increment in omentin-1; 95% CI: 0.5%, 13.9%; P = 0.04). In models adjusted for age, sex, and race, irisin was negatively associated with HDL cholesterol (7.3% decrease per a 10mg/dL increment; 1.0%, 13.3%; P = 0.02) and large HDL particles (15.5% decrease per a 1-SD or 3.5-?mol/L increment; 5.2%, 24.7%; P=0.005). Omentin-1 was positively associated with mean VLDL size (3.8% increase per a 1-SD increment; 0.06%, 7.8%; P = 0.05). Adjustment for alcohol intervention, BMI, and other cytokines did not materially affect these associations.Irisin and omentin-1 are stable within-person, inversely associated with each other, and closely related to lipoprotein profile. These molecules may be promising markers for cardiovascular risk.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060690","annotations":[{"name":"Resistin","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistin"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.845535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Very low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.700897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.633504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.623027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
