{"id":43785,"title":"Spontaneous rupture of hepatic metastasis from small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of maxillary sinus.","abstract":"Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the maxillary sinus, a rare malignant tumor, has a poor prognosis because of its high incidence of metastasis. Moreover, metastatic cancer-induced hepatic rupture, characterized by hemoperitoneum, is infrequent, although several lines of evidences have reported that a wide variety of other neoplasms can cause this usually fatal manifestation.We now present the first case of a 49-year-old man with spontaneous rupture of hepatic metastasis from small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the maxillary sinus and ultimately resulted in massive intraperitoneal bleeding, which was successfully controlled by subsequent surgery (partial hepatectomy). The postoperative clinical manifestation of the patient was uneventful. He was discharged on the 16th day after operation and without any complication.Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the maxillary sinus is very scarce and unfortunately has a poor prognosis. It has potential to cause spontaneous metastatic rupture which can elicit fatal hemorrhage. Emergency surgery is effective, although the long-term outcome is still unsatisfactory.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767405","annotations":[{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.789526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.671355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.66808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.363435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.224882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0539708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"}]}
