{"id":63965,"title":"A new blood group antigen is defined by anti-CD59, detected in a CD59-deficient patient.","abstract":"CD59 is a cell surface glycoprotein of approximately 20?kDa limiting the lytic activity of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Although CD59 is known as a red blood cell (RBC) antigen defined by monoclonal antibodies, it so far has not been identified as a blood group antigen, since the description of a human alloantibody was missing. In this study we show the presence of an anti-CD59 in a patient affected by a homozygous CD59 deficiency.RBC CD59 and CD55 were determined by flow cytometry or by the column agglutination technique using monoclonal antisera. Commercially available His-tagged recombinant soluble CD59 protein was used to inhibit anti-CD59.Seven cases of an isolated CD59 deficiency due to three distinct null alleles of the CD59 gene have been published so far. Recently we described the CD59-null allele c.146delA in a young child of heterozygous parents. Her plasma contained an alloantibody directed against the high-prevalence RBC antigen CD59. The antibody specificity was identified using soluble recombinant human CD59 protein, which blocked the reactivity of the patient's antibody and of monoclonal anti-CD59 but not of monoclonal anti-CD55. In addition, RBC alloantibodies such as anti-K, anti-C, anti-c, or anti-Fy(a) remained unaffected. Therefore, inhibition by recombinant CD59 is a useful diagnostic tool to detect alloantibodies in the presence of anti-CD59.This is the first demonstration of a human anti-CD59 alloantibody, which defines CD59 as an RBC blood group antigen. CD59 represents a candidate for a new blood group system.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24383981","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Agglutination (biology)","weight":0.879507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination_(biology)"},{"name":"Alloimmunity","weight":0.870316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloimmunity"},{"name":"Decay-accelerating factor","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay-accelerating_factor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.846592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Null allele","weight":0.764661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_allele"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.762575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.738209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.670044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"CD59","weight":0.639176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD59"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.603533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Antiserum","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiserum"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Human blood group systems","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_blood_group_systems"},{"name":"Lytic cycle","weight":0.419817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
