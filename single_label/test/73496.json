{"id":73496,"title":"Survey about the use of scalp cooling to prevent alopecia during breast cancer chemotherapy treatment in Canada.","abstract":"Alopecia is a side effect of chemotherapies used in breast cancer. Scalp cooling is a technique preventing alopecia, but its use remains controversial. We conducted a survey about knowledge of scalp cooling and interest in conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT). An invitation was sent to 1,022 participants and a total of 139 individuals responded to the survey. The majority knew about the existence of scalp cooling. Ninety per cent thought that an RCT was needed and would participate. The survey revealed different potential problems associated with the increased chair time, limited space, and safety. We concluded that an RCT is needed and that the trial must include evaluation on the impact on health care system resources and safety.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902427","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.796422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.70516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.663904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.549582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.245635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}]}
