{"id":47636,"title":"[To investigate the opportunity of entecavir treatment for HBeAg-negative acute-on-chronic liver].","abstract":"To explore relations between the opportunities and effects of internal general treatment added Entecavir on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B in different score ranges of acute-on-chronic liver failure severity.A total of 108 ACLF of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients with different ACLF severity score were treated with internal general treatment added Entecavir. The liver failure severity scores, HBV-DNA loads during the initiation of therapy, recovery phase and in deathbed phase, courses of Entecavir administration and mortalities were studied.For 19 patients with high ACLF score (> or = 12), the difference in ACLF score between pre and post-treatment was not significant. The difference in HBV-DNA load between pre and post-treatment was not significant and the mortality was 18/19. For 30 patients with higher intermediate ACLF score (8-11), the difference in ACLF score between pre and post-treatment was not significant. The difference in HBV-DNA load between pre and post-treatment was significant, and the mortality was 66.67% (20/30). For 36 patients with lower intermediate ACLF score (5-7), the difference in ACLF score between pre and posttreatment was not significant. The difference in HBV-DNA load between pre and post-treatment was significant, and the mortality was 30.56% (11/36). For 23 patients with low ACLF score (< or = 4), the difference in ACLF score between pre and post-treatment was significant. The difference in HBV-DNA load between pre and post-treatment was significant, and the mortality was 8.70% (2/23).A novel acute-on-chronic liver failure scoring system can syllabify differentiate the relations between the opportunities and efficacies on the Entecavir treatment for HBeAg-negative ACLF.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579477","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.742918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.716729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.712527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.606172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.544231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.425467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"1819","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1819"},{"name":"811","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/811"},{"name":"1136","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1136"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Deathbed","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathbed"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"}]}
