{"id":39058,"title":"[Debatable aspects of diagnostics and differential diagnostics of irritated bowel syndrome].","abstract":"Diagnostics and differential diagnostics of irritated bowel syndrome are currently governed by Rome III criteria that require that patients' complaints be correlated with these criteria and a minimal amount of laboratory and instrumental studies be conducted. However, such approach is fraught with errors bearing in mind the subjective character of complaints. It is therefore more reasonable to regard diagnosis of irritated bowel syndrome as exclusion diagnosis.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269213","annotations":[{"name":"Mind","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.0804046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Rome process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_process"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0266129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Instrumental","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"}]}
