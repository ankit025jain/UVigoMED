{"id":63264,"title":"[National guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma].","abstract":"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma comprises a heterogeneous group of haematological malignancies, classified according to their clinic, anatomic-pathological features and, lately, to their molecular biomarkers. Despite the therapeutic advances, nearly half of the patients will die because of this disease. The new diagnostic tools have been the cornerstone to design recent therapy targets, which must be included in the current treatment guidelines of this sort of neoplasms by means of clinical trials and evidence-based medicine. In the face of poor diagnoses devices in most of the Mexican hospitals, we recommend the present diagnose stratification, and treatment guidelines for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, based on evidence. They include the latest and most innovative therapeutic approaches, as well as specific recommendations for hospitals with limited framework and therapy resources.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459777","annotations":[{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.563633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.530003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.414333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.138343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.122093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_Guidelines_from_The_Medical_Letter"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
