{"id":61434,"title":"Understanding, avoiding, and treating potential adverse events following the use of injectable poly-L-lactic acid for facial and nonfacial volumization.","abstract":"Injection-related adverse events (AEs) may occur with the use of any injectable substance, including all commercially available fillers. The most common of these AEs include discomfort, bruising, edema, and erythema, which are generally transient and resolve spontaneously. The majority of AEs widely felt to be associated with poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) are papules, nodules, and granulomas. Papules and nodules, which are histologically distinct from granulomas, tend to arise several weeks after injection, are generally palpable, asymptomatic, and nonvisible, and will typically resolve on their own, but can be camouflaged with the use of hyaluronic acid. They generally result from suboptimal product reconstitution or placement and, as such, their incidence can be minimized by improved injection methodology. In contrast, true inflammatory granulomas are very rare (incidence 0.01%-0.1%), seem to be systemic in nature, and represent an overabundance of host reaction to PLLA. Granulomas may become apparent months or years post-injection and may persist and grow over time. Their treatment is geared toward halting the increased secretion of interstitial substances and invasion of cells, and may include the administration of steroids and antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719076","annotations":[{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.861929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.601449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.573978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.534954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.435845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Antimetabolite","weight":0.235327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimetabolite"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Camouflage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage"},{"name":"Overpopulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpopulation"}]}
