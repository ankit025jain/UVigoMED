{"id":40327,"title":"[Effect of shenhuang ointment in promoting the rehabilitation of postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction patients of Qi stagnation blood stasis syndrome: a clinical observation].","abstract":"To observe the effect and safety of plastering Chinese Compound Shenhuang Ointment (CSO) at Shenque (RN8) in promoting the rehabilitation of postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction patients of qi stagnation blood stasis syndrome (QSBSS).A prospective, multi-centered, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial was conducted in 220 postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction patients of QSBSS. They were randomly assigned to two groups, the CSO group (110 cases) and the placebo group (110 cases). CSO was plastered at Shenque (RN8) for 5 days after operation. The time of exhaustion, defecation, the recovery of intestinal peristalsis, integrals of TCM syndrome, and serum levels of motilin (MOT)and somatostatin (SS) were observed.Compared with the placebo group, the condition of exhaustion and defecation, the recovery of intestinal peristalsis on the 3rd day after operation was all improved (P < 0.05). The integrals of TCM syndrome at day 2, 3, and 4 were more significantly lowered in the CSO group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The total effective rate of TCM syndrome was 95.3% in the CSO group, better than that in the placebo group (91.8%, P < 0.05). Compared with the placebo group, the serum MOT level increased and the serum SS level decreased at day 5 after operation in the CSO group (P < 0.05).The plastering of CSO at Shenque (RN8) could advance the time of exhaustion and defecation, and improve patients' clinical symptoms. And patients could tolerate well.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046945","annotations":[{"name":"Peristalsis","weight":0.88562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis"},{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.734738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.65261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.580405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.577197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.539286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.514899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.478888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.453327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"China","weight":0.396625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Motilin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motilin"},{"name":"Blood stasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_stasis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Stucco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stucco"},{"name":"Stasis (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Plasterwork","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasterwork"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Royal Navy","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy"}]}
