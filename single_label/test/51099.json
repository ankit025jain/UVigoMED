{"id":51099,"title":"Recurrent disease in juvenile differentiated thyroid carcinoma: prognostic factors, treatments, and outcomes.","abstract":"The overall prognosis in pediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is excellent. Recurrent disease is frequent, however, and requires additional treatment. We analyzed the probability of recurrence, prognostic factors, treatment, and outcome of juvenile DTC.Fifty-one DTC patients (32 girls and 19 boys; ? 20 y old; mean age, 16.5 y) were treated with (131)I (radioiodine, or radioactive iodine [RAI]); the median follow-up was 10 y. Patients underwent different initial treatments: 46 patients received total thyroidectomy and RAI, 3 patients received total thyroidectomy, and 3 patients received subtotal thyroidectomy. The probability of recurrence and prognostic factors were tested with the Kaplan-Meier method.Initially, 36 of 51 patients achieved complete remission, 14 of 51 achieved partial remission, and 1 of 51 had progressive disease. By the follow-up, 11 of 51 patients (21.6%) had developed recurrent disease; the median appearance time was 4 y (range, 1-15 y). The probabilities of recurrence were 16.7% at 5 y, 22.3% at 10 y, and 33.3% at 15 and 23 y after the initial treatments. Factors that were strongly predictive of recurrence were age (P = 0.001), initial treatment (P = 0.0001), and tumor multifocality (P = 0.011). Sex, nodal metastases at presentation, distal metastases at presentation, histologic type of the tumor, T stage, and clinical stage had no influence on relapse (P = 0.180, P = 0.786, P = 0.796, P = 0.944, P = 0.352, and P = 0.729, respectively). Patients with recurrent disease, partial remission, and progressive disease were retreated, with either surgery or surgery and RAI, receiving cumulative activities of up to 40 GBq. The overall outcome in our patients was excellent: 90.2% complete remission, 3.92% partial remission, 1.96% stable disease, 1.96% disease-related death, and 1.96% another cause of death.Younger age at diagnosis, less radical primary surgery without subsequent RAI, and tumor multifocality are factors that are strongly prognostic for recurrence. For reducing the rate of relapse and improving surveillance for recurrent disease, total thyroidectomy followed by RAI appears to be the most beneficial initial treatment for patients with juvenile DTC. The use of RAI seems to be safe, with no adverse effects on subsequent fertility and pregnancy or secondary malignancy.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722527","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.916965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.872261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.491594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.401283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.396713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.386533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Becquerel","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.284813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.250134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"RAI","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
