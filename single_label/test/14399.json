{"id":14399,"title":"Preparation and efficacy of Newcastle disease virus DNA vaccine encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles.","abstract":"Optimal preparation conditions of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) F gene deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles (pFNDV-CS-NPs) were determined. The pFNDV-CS-NPs were prepared according to a complex coacervation method. The pFNDV-CS-NPs were produced with good morphology, high stability, a mean diameter of 199.5 nm, encapsulation efficiency of 98.37% ± 0.87%, loading capacity of 36.12% ± 0.19%, and a zeta potential of +12.11 mV. The in vitro release assay showed that the plasmid DNA was sustainably released from the pFNDV-CS-NPs, up to 82.9% ± 2.9% of the total amount. Cell transfection test indicated that the vaccine expressed the F gene in cells and maintained good bioactivity. Additionally, the safety of mucosal immunity delivery system of the pFNDV-CS-NPs was also tested in vitro by cell cytotoxicity and in vivo by safety test in chickens. In vivo immunization showed that better immune responses of specific pathogen-free chickens immunized with the pFNDV-CS-NPs were induced, and prolonged release of the plasmid DNA was achieved compared to the chickens immunized with the control plasmid. This study lays the foundation for the further development of mucosal vaccines and drugs encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24426783","annotations":[{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.814978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.789253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.742034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.556219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"DNA vaccination","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.491364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chitosan","weight":0.370936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitosan"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.118274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Newcastle disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_disease"},{"name":"Zeta potential","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_potential"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Cell (journal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(journal)"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"}]}
