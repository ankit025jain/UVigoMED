{"id":31284,"title":"Bisphenol A and human chronic diseases: current evidences, possible mechanisms, and future perspectives.","abstract":"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide, with over 6billion pounds produced and over 100t released into the atmosphere each year. Recent extensive literature has raised concerns about its possible implication in the etiology of some human chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, reproductive disorders, cardiovascular diseases, birth defects, chronic respiratory and kidney diseases and breast cancer. In this review, we present the highlighted evidences on the relationship between BPA exposure and human chronic diseases and we discuss its eventual mechanisms of action, especially genetic, epigenetic and endocrine disruption mechanisms with the possible involvement of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell signaling.
