{"id":30839,"title":"Perinatal smoking and depression in women with concurrent substance use.","abstract":"The purpose of this report was to examine the course of smoking among pregnant women with concurrent substance use, and to assess the impact of depression on smoking.Data were gathered as part of a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of substance abuse treatment in pregnant women. Women (n=176) were recruited before 28 completed weeks of pregnancy, and followed until 3months postpartum. Depression was assessed using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview. Our outcome was the average number of cigarettes smoked per day. Linear mixed effects regression was used to measure differential changes in smoking.66% of women smoked in the three months before pregnancy, 42% of pre-pregnancy smokers achieved abstinence before delivery and 60% of the baseline cohort smoked postpartum. Smoking did not differ significantly between depressed and non-depressed groups. After delivery both groups increased smoking at similar rates.Smoking was common among our cohort of pregnant women with a history of substance use. Women were able to discontinue or decrease smoking during pregnancy, but were likely to resume or increase smoking postpartum. Having clinically significant depressive symptoms or a diagnosis of depression did not have an obvious effect on smoking behaviors.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447885","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.793322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.698754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.446553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.293939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.15817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0436208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Substance-related disorder","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance-related_disorder"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Smoking and pregnancy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_and_pregnancy"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Mixed model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model"},{"name":"Regression (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_(psychology)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
