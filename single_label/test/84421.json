{"id":84421,"title":"[Blood flow measurement and clinical usefulness of the temporal fascial scar tissue flap and the periosteal scar tissue flap in posterior canal wall reconstructed tympanoplasty for the mastoid cavity problem in the postoperative ear].","abstract":"In the postoperative ear, following reconstructive tympanoplasty for a mastoid cavity problem, a very important key is to maintain a stable reconstructed posterior canal wall with the bone plate and cartilage in the posterior canal wall. The authors manage reconstruction of the posterior canal wall with the temporal fascial scar tissue flap (TFSF) and the temporal periosteal scar tissue flap (TPSF) to ensure obtaining a stable posterior canal wall and a tympanic membrane graft. Well-vascularized TFSF and TPSF enable us to acquire a solid reconstructed posterior canal wall because of the secure blood supplies to the flaps. In order to investigate the blood supplies of TFSF and TPSF, we employed laser Doppler blood flowmeters and measured blood flow in the flaps in 20 cases of posyoperative ears treated for a mastoid cavity problem. The blood supplies to both flaps were good, with the blood supply to the TFSF being statistically better than in the case of the TPSF. These findings suggested that the TFSF and TPSF were a reliable source of local well-vascularized tissue which were pliable and could facilitate the creation of a stable posterior canal wall. Furthermore it seems the good blood supply was linked to the prompt postoperative healing, the avoidance of postoperative infection, and good hearing improvement postoperatively.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102736","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.820992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.807664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.681021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.616645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.4894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.414288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.395523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.319567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.226276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Flow measurement","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0757289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Posterior semicircular canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_semicircular_canal"}]}
