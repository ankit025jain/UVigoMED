{"id":76975,"title":"Oral administration of the milk casein-derived tripeptide Val-Pro-Pro attenuates high-fat diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation in mice.","abstract":"Inflammation of adipose tissue triggers the metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis and CHD. In the present study, we investigated whether the milk casein-derived tripeptide valine-proline-proline (VPP) has an anti-inflammatory effect on the adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Male C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks of age) were fed ad libitum with either a HFD and plain tap water (HFD group) or a HFD and water containing 0Â·3 mg VPP/ml (HFD+VPP group) for 10 weeks. The results showed that the expression level of CD18 in the peripheral blood monocytes of the HFD+VPP group was significantly decreased compared with the level observed in those of the HFD group. Activated monocytes and pro-inflammatory macrophages were accumulated in the stromal vascular fractions of the adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice, which were significantly decreased in those supplemented with VPP. The formation of crown-like structures rich in pro-inflammatory macrophages was also significantly reduced in the adipose tissue of mice administered with VPP. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and that of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in adipose tissue tend to be lower in the HFD+VPP group than in the HFD group. These observations indicate that oral administration of VPP exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on the adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice, which may eventually lead to the primary prevention of chronic inflammation-related diseases.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
