{"id":36317,"title":"Inducible transient expression of Smpd3 prevents early lethality in fro/fro mice.","abstract":"Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) is a pleiotropic lipid metabolizing enzyme involved in multiple physiological processes. A deletion mutation in the murine Smpd3 gene called fragilitas ossium (fro) leads to severe skeletal abnormalities in the developing fro/fro embryos. Although fro/fro mice can be useful to study many different aspects of SMPD3 functions, their perinatal lethality makes it difficult to generate a sufficient number of mice for controlled studies. In fact, on the C57BL/6 genetic background, none of the fro/fro mice survive beyond the perinatal stage. In this study, we used the \"Tet-On\" inducible gene expression system to express Smpd3 transiently in fro/fro;ROSA-rtTA;TRE-Smpd3 embryos on the C57BL/6 background. This induced Smpd3 expression corrected all the skeletal abnormalities in these embryos and prevented their early death. However, induction of Smpd3 expression in the adolescent fro/fro;ROSA-rtTA;TRE-Smpd3 mice was not sufficient to correct the defects in trabecular bone mineralization and the impaired growth of the long bones. This novel mouse model will be a useful tool to study SMPD3 biology in vivo.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585429","annotations":[{"name":"Pleiotropy","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.732534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.697854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.51448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Sphingomyelin","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingomyelin"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.489645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.469015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.397409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Phosphodiesterase","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase"},{"name":"Mineralization (biology)","weight":0.294542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralization_(biology)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Trabecula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecula"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
