{"id":17316,"title":"Serum lipid profile, cytokine production, and clinical outcome in patients with severe sepsis.","abstract":"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of hypolipidemia and the relationship to cytokine concentrations and outcomes in septic patients.A prospective study was undertaken including 50 patients with severe sepsis due to community-acquired infections. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein as well as tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?), interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF) ?1 were determined on admission and days 3 and 10 during hospitalization.Of the 50 patients enrolled, 28 survived, whereas 22 died during their hospital stay. Sepsis survivors had significantly higher HDL-C concentrations than nonsurvivors, whereas all patients with HDL-C values greater than 25 mg/dL survived. Baseline levels of TGF-?1 were significantly higher in survivors. High-density lipoprotein levels correlated inversely with TNF-?, IL-6, and IL-10 concentrations and positively with baseline TGF-?1 levels. Independent risk factors of mortality were IL-10 levels on day 3, whereas HDL-C concentration on admission was related to survival.Low cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations are detected in septic patients, especially in individuals with poor outcome. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration seems to be an early independent predictive marker of survival in severe sepsis.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891152","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.671518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.663323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.625652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.561584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.474321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.429433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
