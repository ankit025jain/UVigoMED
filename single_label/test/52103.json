{"id":52103,"title":"Adipocyte dysfunction in rats with streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetes.","abstract":"Administration of streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NA) to adult rats allows for the induction of mild diabetes. However, this experimental model has not been fully characterized. This study was undertaken to determine the metabolic and secretory activity of adipose tissue in rats with STZ-NA-induced diabetes. Experiments were performed using epididymal adipocytes isolated from control and mildly diabetic rats. Lipogenesis, glucose transport as well as glucose and alanine oxidation, lipolysis, anti-lipolysis, cAMP levels and adipokine secretion were compared in cells isolated from the control and diabetic rats. Lipogenesis, glucose transport and oxidation were diminished in the adipocytes of diabetic rats compared with the fat cells of control animals. However, alanine oxidation appeared to be similar in the cells of non-diabetic and diabetic animals. Lipolytic response to low epinephrine concentrations was slightly increased in the adipocytes of diabetic rats; however, at higher concentrations of the hormone, lipolysis was similar in both groups of cells. The epinephrine-induced rise in cAMP levels was higher in the adipocytes of STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats, even in the presence of insulin. Lipolysis stimulated by dibutyryl-cAMP did not significantly differ, whereas anti-lipolytic effects of insulin were mildly decreased in the cells of diabetic rats. Secretion of adiponectin and leptin was substantially diminished in the adipocytes of diabetic rats compared with the cells of control animals. Our studies demonstrated that the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis in the adipose tissue of rats with mild diabetes induced by STZ and NA is slightly shifted towards reduced lipid accumulation. Simultaneously, adiponectin and leptin secretion is significantly impaired.
