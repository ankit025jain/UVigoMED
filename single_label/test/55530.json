{"id":55530,"title":"Intrastromal corneal ring segments implantation in patients with keratoconus: 10-year follow-up.","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Ferrara intrastromal corneal ring segments (ICRS) (Ferrara Ring; AJL, Boecillo, Spain) in patients with keratoconus.The chart records of 36 eyes of 30 patients with keratoconus implanted with ICRS, operated on between July 1996 and January 2002, were retrospectively reviewed. The following parameters were studied: uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), keratometry (K), and central corneal thickness. The outcomes were evaluated at 5 and 10 years after ICRS implantation.The mean UDVA (logMAR) improved from 1.01 ± 0.28 (20/200 Snellen) to 0.71 ± 0.38 (20/100 Snellen) at 5 years (P < .05) and 0.67 ± 0.25 (20/90 Snellen) at 10 years (P = .735). The mean CDVA (logMAR) improved from 0.45 ± 0.45 (20/55 Snellen) to 0.24 ± 0.19 (20/35 Snellen) at 5 years (P < .05) and 0.29 ± 0.09 (20/38 Snellen) at 10 years (P = .292). The mean maximum K value decreased from 54.99 ± 6.33 to 50.58 ± 5.11 D at 5 years (P < .05) and 50.65 ± 5.17 D at 10 years (P = .854). The mean minimum K value decreased from 48.85 ± 5.70 to 46.90 ± 5.08 D at 5 years (P < .05) and 47.12 ± 4.22 D at 10 years (P = .945). The central corneal thickness decreased from 457.42 ± 58.21 to 421.34 ± 74.12 ?m at 5 years (P = .039) and 434.32 ± 77.65 ?m at 10 years (P = .427).Intrastromal corneal ring segments can effectively improve UDVA and CDVA 10 years after implantation in patients with keratoconus.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864323","annotations":[{"name":"Spain","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Ferrara","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrara"},{"name":"International Celestial Reference System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Celestial_Reference_System"},{"name":"Intrastromal corneal ring segments","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrastromal_corneal_ring_segments"},{"name":"Keratometer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratometer"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"21st century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_BC"},{"name":"2038","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2038"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"854","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/854"},{"name":"735","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/735"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"945","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/945"},{"name":"2035","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2035"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"2090s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2090s"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Hooke's law","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_chart_achievements_and_milestones"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Alias (season 5)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(season_5)"},{"name":"Home (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_(Angel)"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
