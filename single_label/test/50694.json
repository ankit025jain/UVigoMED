{"id":50694,"title":"ATAD2 is highly expressed in ovarian carcinomas and indicates poor prognosis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to explore the expression of ATAD2 in ovarian tumor tissue as well as its relationship with degree of malignancy. Tumor tissue from 110 cases of ovarian cancer was collected in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for evaluation of ATAD2 expression immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. The correlation between the ATAD2 expression and and the prognosis of ovarian cancer was evaluated by Cox regression model. In addition, HO-8910 and OVCAR-3 cells were transfected with two siRNAs targeting ATAD2. Cell viability was evaluated with MTT assay, and cell migration by transwell migration assay. ATAD2 was shown to be highly expressed in 65.5% (72/110) of ovarian cancer cases, both at transcriptional and protein levels. Moreover, highly expression was positively correlated with degree of malignancy. Knock-down of ATAD2 in HO-8910 and OVCAR-3 cells was found to reduce cell migration. In addition, follow-up visits of the patients demonstrated that the 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with high expression of ATAD2. Our study suggested that ovarian tumor tissue may have highly expressed ATAD2, which is associated with tumor stage, omentum-metastasis, ascites and CA-125. Increased ATAD2 may play important roles in tumor proliferation and migration. ATAD2 could serve in particular as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761900","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.707499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.704336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.580828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.554797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.46606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.45895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.246245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.188149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.112803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Chemotaxis assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis_assay"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
