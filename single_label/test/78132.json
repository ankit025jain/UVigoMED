{"id":78132,"title":"Time-frequency analysis of transient evoked-otoacoustic emissions in individuals with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to describe and quantify the cochlear active mechanisms in individuals with Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders (ANSD). Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAEs) were recorded in 15 individuals with ANSD and 22 individuals with normal hearing. TEOAEs were analyzed by Wavelet transform method to describe and quantify the characteristics of TEOAEs in narrow-band frequency regions. It was noted that the amplitude of TEOAEs was higher and latency slightly shorter in individuals with ANSD compared to normal hearing individuals at low and mid frequencies. The increased amplitude and reduced latencies of TEOAEs in ANSD group could be attributed to the efferent system damage, especially at low and mid frequencies seen in individuals with ANSD. Thus, wavelet analysis of TEOAEs proves to be another important tool to understand the patho-physiology in individuals with ANSD.
