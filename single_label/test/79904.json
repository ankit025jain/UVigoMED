{"id":79904,"title":"The contribution of reduction in malaria as a cause of rapid decline of under-five mortality: evidence from the Rufiji Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in rural Tanzania.","abstract":"Under-five mortality has been declining rapidly in a number of sub-Saharan African settings. Malaria-related mortality is known to be a major component of childhood causes of death and malaria remains a major focus of health interventions. The paper explored the contribution of malaria relative to other specific causes of under-five deaths to these trends.This paper uses longitudinal demographic surveillance data to examine trends and causes of death of under-five mortality in Rufiji, whose population has been followed for over nine years (1999-2007). Causes of death, determined by the verbal autopsy technique, are analysed with Arriaga's decomposition method to assess the contribution of declining malaria-related mortality relative to other causes of death as explaining a rapid decline in overall childhood mortality.Over the 1999-2007 period, under-five mortality rate in Rufiji declined by 54.3%, from 33.3 to 15.2 per 1,000 person-years. If this trend is sustained, Rufiji will be a locality that achieves MDG4 target. Although hypotrophy at birth remained the leading cause of death for neonates, malaria remains as the leading cause of death for post-neonates followed by pneumonia. However, declines in malaria death rates accounted for 49.9% of the observed under-five mortality decline while all perinatal causes accounted for only 19.9%.To achieve MDG 4 in malaria endemic settings, health programmes should continue efforts to reduce malaria mortality and more efforts are also needed to improve newborn survival.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885311","annotations":[{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Tanzania","weight":0.72491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.703472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.702255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.630283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.590867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.54469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.516221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.448994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.402379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.355612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.334163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.261872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.2065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Millennium Development Goals","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"}]}
