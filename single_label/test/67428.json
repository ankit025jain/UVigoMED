{"id":67428,"title":"Estrogen receptor ? (ER?) is a novel prognostic marker of recurrence survival in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer potentially by inhibiting cadherin switch.","abstract":"The function and significance of estrogen receptor ? (ER?) in bladder cancer remains a field of hot debate. In this study, we aimed to (a) evaluate ER? as a novel prognostic marker of recurrence free survival; and (b) digest the underlying mechanism by elucidating the relationship between ER? expression and cadherin switch.We examined the expression levels of ER?, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in 42 initial non-muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinomas via immunohistochemistry. Correlation analysis was performed among ER? expression, cadherin switch and recurrence free survival. Moreover, in vitro studies were performed to validate the identified correlation using two bladder cancer cell lines RT4 and 253J. Upon stimulation with an ER? selective agonist diarylpropionitrile, E-cadherin, N-cadherin expressions; cell migration and invasion capacity were assessed.Expression of ER? protein was seen in 34 bladder cancer cases (80.9%), and 21 (50%) specimens showed non-cadherin switch (positive E-cadherin and negative N-cadherin). ER? expression and the non-cadherin switch are both accompanied with better recurrence free survival. Also, the least ER? expression was observed in specimens that undergo cadherin switch. Moreover, these results were consistent with our observations in bladder cancer RT4 and 253J cell lines studies. Diarylpropionitrile stimulation resulted in an increase in E-cadherin, a decrease in N-cadherin expression and abolished cell migration and invasion.ER? is a prognostic marker of recurrence free rate in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, potentially through suppressing cadherin switch, and may act as a potential target for bladder cancer therapy.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616912","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.626941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.559469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cadherin","weight":0.473713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadherin"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.365191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.219174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.119821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.0742319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"}]}
