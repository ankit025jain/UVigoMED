{"id":63963,"title":"Cytokine responses of TNF-?, IL-6, and IL-10 in G6PD-deficient infants.","abstract":"G6PD-deficient adults are reported to be susceptible to severe infection, and decreased cytokine responses have been postulated as the underlying mechanism. However, investigating the association of G6PD deficiency and cytokine responses during infancy is lacking. The current study aims to determine whether cytokine responses of tumor necrosis factor ()-?, interleukins (IL)-6, and IL-10 are impaired in the G6PD-deficient infants. Upon agreements with informed consents, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of enrolled infants were collected twice at 1 month and 1 year of age. PBMCs were then stimulated with toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists-including PAM3csk4 for TLR1-2, poly (I:C) for TLR3, and lipopolysaccharide for TLR4-to analyze the expression of TNF-?, IL-6, and IL-10. Males (P = .004) and phototherapy during neonatal period (P = .008) were more common among G6PD-deficient infants than G6PD-normal subjects. After the stimulation of TLR agonists, there was no significant difference in the expression of TNF-?, IL-6, and IL-10 between PBMCs of G6PD-deficient and -normal infants at both 1 month and 1 year of age. In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of G6PD-deficient infants are different from those of G6PD-normal subjects. The data suggest that the innate immune responses to TLR agonists in G6PD-deficient infants are not different from those of G6PD-normal infants.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24383988","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.675463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"TLR 4","weight":0.581814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_4"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0547701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"TLR 3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_3"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0144303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase"}]}
