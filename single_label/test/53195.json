{"id":53195,"title":"LPS induced miR-181a promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration via targeting PTEN and MAP2K4.","abstract":"Pancreatic cancer is aggressive; 80-90 % of pancreatic cancer patients have already developed metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis. Inflammation has been shown to facilitate pancreatic cancer migration. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway is an important inflammatory signal transduction pathway. However, the mechanism of inflammation pathway to induce pancreatic cancer migration is unclear.The purpose of this study was to investigate how inflammation affects pancreatic cancer migration.RT-PCR was used to detect the TLRs expression files in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues. Pancreatic cancer cells migration was assessed after treatment with TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, two tumor suppressors, PTEN and MAP2K4, were detected. Then we predicted and proved the miRNA which targeted PTEN and MAP2K4.We found that the expression of TLR4 was increased in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues. After treatment with LPS, the migration of pancreatic cancer cells was increased and the protein levels of two tumor suppressors, PTEN and MAP2K4, were inhibited. To investigate the possible mechanism, we checked the expression of miR-181a. The result showed that miR-181a was decreased by LPS. Furthermore, we predicted and confirmed that both PTEN and MAP2K4 were miR-181a targets. Pancreatic cancer tissues analysis showed that PTEN and MAP2K4 were all negatively correlated with miR-181a.These results suggest that the LPS-TLR4-miR-181a signaling pathway plays a significant role in pancreatic cancer invasion and progression.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532253","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.804709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.791143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.752786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.671674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.61198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.58887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.570113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase","weight":0.559154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.5184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.430451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"TLR 4","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_4"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"}]}
