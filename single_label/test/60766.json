{"id":60766,"title":"An unusual presentation of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.","abstract":"Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD), also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare, self-limited disease of unknown etiology. This condition is most commonly encountered in Asian and Caucasian females of childbearing age who usually present with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever. Though rarely, KFD has been described in younger African-American females as well. It often mimics more serious conditions such as lymphoma, metastatic solid malignancy, HIV infection, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Although its etiopathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, literature suggests viral or possibly autoimmune components to play a role. We describe a 34-year-old African-American female who presented with constitutional symptoms and polyadenopathy on clinical examination and imaging, of which the portacaval and portahepatis lymph nodes were most prominent. An extensive workup was otherwise unremarkable, and biopsy showed histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. Initially, her clinical condition improved spontaneously, and she required only a short course of oral steroids. Three months later, she relapsed with bilateral cervical adenopathy and constitutional symptoms and was successfully managed again with steroids. Our case is unique with respect to (a) portahepatis and portacaval node enlargement as the dominant adenopathy and (b) her underlying conditions of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830120","annotations":[{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia"},{"name":"Chronic fatigue syndrome","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.732852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Histiocyte","weight":0.647441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocyte"},{"name":"Kikuchi disease","weight":0.644315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikuchi_disease"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.636534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.507807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.346553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
