{"id":53291,"title":"Detection and analysis of hard exudates by polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography in patients with diabetic maculopathy.","abstract":"To image and analyze hard exudates (HEs) and their precursors in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) by using polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT).Twenty-two eyes of 16 patients with DME were imaged by using color fundus photography (CF) and PS-OCT. In PS-OCT, HEs were automatically detected by their distinct polarization-scrambling qualities. Color fundus images were manually graded for the presence of HEs by two masked graders and correlated with the corresponding PS-OCT HE maps: corresponding images were overlaid and an identical grid of 128 × 128 fields was used for correlation of detected HEs.In all eyes, HEs were present owing to DME. Agreement of a pixel-to-pixel analysis of HEs in CF images was 0.72 (Cohen's ?) between graders and 0.44 between graders and automated detection by PS-OCT. Mean ± SD detection of HEs was significantly higher in PS-OCT than in manual grading (1180.5 ± 1009.8 fields versus 828.8 ± 695.0 fields; P = 0.02). The higher detection rate of PS-OCT was confirmed by a linear regression analysis with a slope of ? = 1.18 (r = 0.81).PS-OCT enables not only two-dimensional imaging of the extent of HEs, as in CF, but also allows tissue-specific, three-dimensional imaging of HEs throughout retinal layers, based on their distinct polarization-scrambling characteristics. The higher detection rate in PS-OCT images indicates an increased sensitivity of PS-OCT imaging over conventional CF.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526446","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.908778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.702841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.516351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.445284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.294638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Slope","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Distance measuring equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measuring_equipment"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Standard-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television"},{"name":"828","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/828"},{"name":"1009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1009"},{"name":"695","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/695"},{"name":"1180","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1180"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Wrestling mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_mask"},{"name":"Overlay plan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_plan"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Television advertisement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Maculopathy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopathy"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"}]}
