{"id":37622,"title":"Summarizing craniofacial genetics and developmental biology (SCGDB).","abstract":"This overview article highlights active areas of research in craniofacial genetics and developmental biology as reflected in presentations given at the 34th annual meeting of the Society of Craniofacial Genetics and Developmental Biology (SCGDB) in Montreal, Quebec on October 11, 2011. This 1-day meeting provided a stimulating occasion that demonstrated the present status of research in craniofacial genetics and developmental biology and where the field is heading. To accompany the abstracts published in this issue I have selected several themes that emerged from the meeting. After discussing the basis on which craniofacial defects/syndromes are classified and investigated, I address the multi-gene basis of craniofacial syndromes with an examination of the roles of Sox9 and FGF receptors in normal and abnormal craniofacial development. I then turn to the knowledge being gained from population-wide and longitudinal cohort studies and from the discovery of new signaling centers that regulate craniofacial development.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482307","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.789466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.503483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"Quebec","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.129031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"SOX9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX9"},{"name":"October 11","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_11"},{"name":"Abstract (summary)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)"},{"name":"Discovery (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"34th Grammy Awards","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Grammy_Awards"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"}]}
