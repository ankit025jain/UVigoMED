{"id":12899,"title":"Antiretroviral therapy partly reverses the systemic and mucosal distribution of NK cell subsets that is altered by SIVmac??? infection of macaques.","abstract":"We characterized three subsets of NK cells in blood, and two subsets in mucosal tissues. SIVmac251 infection increased total and CD16(+) NK cells in the blood. In the rectum, we observed a significant increase in total and NKG2A(+) NK cells during SIV infection. In contrast, the NKp44(+) subset significantly depleted in acute infection and continued to decline in frequency during chronic phase. During SIV infection, blood CD16 and mucosal NKG2A(+) subsets had increased cytotoxic potential. Intriguingly, the NKp44(+) NK cell subtype that likely mediates mucosal homeostasis via the production of cytokines, acquired cytotoxicity. Antiretroviral therapy significantly increased the frequency of mucosal NKG2A(+) NK cells and peripheral CD16(+) NK cells. However, it failed to restore the normal frequency of NKp44(+) NK cells in the rectum. Thus, SIVmac251 infection causes changes in the distribution and function of NK cells and antiretroviral therapy during chronic infection only partially restores NK homeostasis and function.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503100","annotations":[{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.735494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.733965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.689765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.55248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.494889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Simian immunodeficiency virus","weight":0.44692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"CD16","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD16"},{"name":"NKG2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKG2"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
