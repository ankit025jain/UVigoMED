{"id":62434,"title":"Five important advances in hematopathology.","abstract":"Hematopathology is a dynamic field that has always been on the frontier of clinical research within the scope of pathology. Several recent developments in hematopathology will likely affect its practice clinically.To review 5 important recent advances in hematopathology: (1) detection and prognostic implication of MYC in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, (2) determining origin and prognosis through immunoglobulin gene usage in mature B-cell neoplasms, (3)detecting minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma, (4) using genome-wide analysis in myelodysplastic syndromes, and (5) employing whole-genome sequencing in acute myeloid leukemias.Literature review and the authors' experiences in an academic center.These advances will bring hematopathology into a new molecular era and help us to better understand the molecular, pathologic mechanisms of lymphomas, leukemias, myelomas, and myelodysplastic syndromes. They will help us to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers and eventually provide new therapeutic targets and treatments for these diseases.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576034","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.683796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.630781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.533837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.442143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.435876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hematopathology","weight":0.291689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopathology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Think tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank"}]}
