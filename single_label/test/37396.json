{"id":37396,"title":"An MTHFR variant, plasma homocysteine levels and late-onset coronary artery disease in subjects from southern Iran.","abstract":"There have been many controversial debates on the role of Hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHcy) as an independent risk factor for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) during recent years. Furthermore, an alanine/valine (Ala/Val) gene polymorphism at 222nd amino acid of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has been considered as a factor that could render this enzyme thermolabile and less active which in turn may yield a subsequent increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. To assess whether this polymorphism is associated with increased risk of CAD and plasma levels of tHcy in a population from southern Iran, a total of 457 patients with angiographically documented multi-vessel CAD were compared with a control group comprised of 371 subjects with <30% stenosis in all major vessels. Nevertheless our results failed to admit a significant difference between CAD individuals and control subjects for Ala/Val polymorphism and plasma Hcy concentrations. However, plasma Hcy concentrations were significantly higher in individuals with Val/Val genotype than subjects with Ala/Ala genotype, but it didn't show a significant association with CAD in our population. Moreover, as the multiple linear regression analysis indicated, smoking habit, folate levels and the MTHFR Val/Val genotype were the only major predictors of tHcy concentrations in the current investigation.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498831","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.673986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.620292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.575365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.568405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.490991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.46282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.432148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.36528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.295348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.15832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
