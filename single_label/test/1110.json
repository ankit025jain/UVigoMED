{"id":1110,"title":"Cardiovascular disease in Latin America: the growing epidemic.","abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) produce almost a million deaths a year in Latin America (LA), becoming the main cause of death in the last years, and it is estimated that the number of deaths in the region attributable to CVD will increase in the near future. This new epidemic is a consequence of the demographic, economic and social changes observed in LA in recent years. Coronary heart disease and stroke causes 42.5% and 28.8%, respectively of the CVD mortality in the region. Chagas heart involvement and rheumatic heart disease, once a major health problem, are responsible of only 1% of the mortality each. Improving in socioeconomic status, increased life expectancy and high prevalence of risk factors for atherosclerosis have been the major determinants of this marked epidemiologic change.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443823","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.736716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.697756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Rheumatic fever","weight":0.625468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatic_fever"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.328168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}
