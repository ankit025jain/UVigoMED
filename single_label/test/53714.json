{"id":53714,"title":"[Comparative data of prokinetics in treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with diabetes].","abstract":"The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of itopride (IP) and domperidone (DP) in the treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in combination with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1 and 2.40 patients were examined with GERD and type 1 diabetes and 50 patients with GERD and type 2 diabetes. Each group of patients with GERD, DM 1 and 2 has been divided into: the basic subgroup receiving IG 50 mg 3 tid and control--DP 10 mg tid. Patients were also administered omeprazole. Both subgroups were strictly randomized to key indicators, except for therapy. Baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks, all patients were examined to identify complaints, endoscopy and pH-metric changes, gastric motility was studied by electrogastroenterographic method (PEGEG).In the subgroups of patients with GERD + DM 1 and GERD + DM 2, received treatment with IG complaints on heartburn, regurgitation, odynophagia relieved significantly earlier then in the subgroups treated with DP. After 4 weeks of therapy, decreasing in the number of gastroesophageal refluxes, number of patients with erosive esophagitis B level, and normalization of the motility of the stomach were significantly higher in the groups of GERD + DM 1 and GERD + DM 2 received treatment with IG when compared with the subgroup of PD. There were no side effects of prokinetics.IG was more effective then DP in the treatment of GERD in patients with diabetes, and may be recommended for inclusion in the scheme of treatment of this comorbidity.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501946","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.899863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Omeprazole","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole"},{"name":"Domperidone","weight":0.870827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domperidone"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Heartburn","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.595399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.543164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.52668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.431197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.429997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Odynophagia","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odynophagia"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Itopride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itopride"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Lattice of subgroups","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_of_subgroups"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal physiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_physiology"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Scotland B national football team","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_B_national_football_team"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
