{"id":47643,"title":"[Serum GP73 were increased in patients with fatty liver disease].","abstract":"To explore the levels of serum GP73 in patients with fatty liver disease.The sera GP73 were determined by ELISA in 178 patients with fatty liver disease and 100 healthy controls.Serum GP73 levels were significantly increased in patients with various fatty liver diseases(70.62 +/- 60.60 ng/ml), compared with those of control population (35.61 +/- 12.22 ng/ml). In patients with alcoholic fatty liver disease, acute liver injury, chronic hepatitis B, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, their serum GP73 concentration were 81.86 +/- 47.82 ng/ml, 82.77 +/- 77.73 ng/ml, 63.84 +/- 50.62 ng/ml, and 65.75 +/- 62.20 ng/ml, respectively. But no significant difference was found between these groups (P > 0.05). In 68 patients with F > or = 1.0 (71.46 +/- 66.48 ng/ml), 75 patients with F> or = 2.0 (69.58 +/- 62.31 ng/ml), and 34 patients with F3-F4 (71.65 +/- 43.89 ng/ml), there were also no marked differences was observed between these fatty groups (F = 0.02, P = 0.98).Serum GP73 levels were increased in patients with different liver diseases, but its concentrations were seems not related with degree of fatty injury.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579464","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.59084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.303556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.232613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Liver diseases","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_diseases"},{"name":"Fujita scale","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujita_scale"},{"name":"Grumman F3F","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F3F"}]}
