{"id":60922,"title":"Primary splenic angiosarcoma associated with anemia, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"Primary angiosarcoma of the spleen is a rare neoplasm arising from endothelial cells. It is an aggressive neoplasm with a poor prognosis. We report a case of 61-year-old Caucasian man who presented with shortness of breath, anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Ultrasound Sonogram (US) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans revealed a massively enlarged spleen with numerous enhancing hypodense lesions. The spleen was adherent to the omentum, retroperitoneum, and tail of the pancreas. Image-guided Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) revealed an atypical spindle cell lesion. Resection of the spleen and attached tail of pancreas was performed. Histological examination and immunohistochemical studies revealed a diffuse vascular malignant neoplasm with features of angiosarcoma. The patient appeared disease free after resection. He died within 5 months of unknown etiology.
