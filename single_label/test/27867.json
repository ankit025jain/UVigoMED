{"id":27867,"title":"Methoxetamine--a novel recreational drug with potent hallucinogenic properties.","abstract":"Methoxetamine is one of the constantly growing group of novel psychoactive substances that has emerged in recent years. The compound belongs to the arylcyclohexylamine class, which is used for its recreational and psychedelic effects. Methoxetamine is a structural analogue of ketamine, with a much longer duration of action and intensity of effects, and has been extensively advertised as its 'legal' and 'bladder friendly' alternative. This review surveys the current state of knowledge regarding the metabolism, pharmacology, prevalence and pattern of methoxetamine use, and analytical methods of its detection. Consumption of methoxetamine bears a significant health risk and may even lead to fatal intoxication. A significant amount of research is still needed in order to fully quantify the short- and long-term effects of methoxetamine and its interaction with other drugs of abuse.
