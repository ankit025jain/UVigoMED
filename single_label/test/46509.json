{"id":46509,"title":"Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic factor in biliary tract cancer.","abstract":"Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) include intrahepatic (IHC), hilar, distal bile duct (DBD) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of host inflammation, is prognostic in several cancers but has not been reviewed in large BTC series, or advanced BTC (ABTC) at diagnosis.Baseline demographics and NLR at diagnosis were retrospectively evaluated in 864 consecutive patients with BTC treated from January 1987 to December 2012. The association between NLR and overall survival (OS) was determined using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.Eight hundred and sixty-four patients were included in the analysis, of which 62% had ABTC and 38% had surgery with curative intent. Median age was 65 years, 444 (51%) were male and 727 (84%) had performance status (PS) ? 2. A NLR ? 3.0, PS >2, IHC primary, stage, lack of surgery, haemoglobin <110 g/L and albumin <40 g/L were associated with significantly worse OS on multivariable analysis. A NLR ? 3.0 was an independent prognostic factor for OS for the entire cohort; median OS was 21.6 months versus 12.0 months for patients with NLR <3.0 versus NLR ? 3.0 respectively (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)-1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.06-1.50, P = 0.01). NLR was also prognostic in patients with ABTC (HR-1.26, 95% CI; 1.02-1.56, P = 0.035) and hilar cancer: overall group (N = 149) (HR-1.70, 95% CI; 1.10-2.50, P = 0.01) and advanced group (N = 111) (HR-1.57, 95% CI; 1.04-2.44, P = 0.048).Baseline NLR is a readily available and inexpensive prognostic biomarker in patients with BTC and likely warrants validation in large prospective clinical trials.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630393","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Biliary tract","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_tract"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.811277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.711212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.466335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.417041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Hilum (anatomy)","weight":0.373784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.370783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.284813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.219918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.133733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
