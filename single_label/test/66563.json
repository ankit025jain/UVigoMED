{"id":66563,"title":"Maternal hypertensive disorders during pregnancy: adaptive functioning and psychiatric and psychological problems of the older offspring.","abstract":"To study whether pre-eclampsia and hypertension without proteinuria during pregnancy are associated with adaptive functioning, and psychiatric and psychological problems, of older offspring.Retrospective longitudinal cohort study.Participants in the Helsinki Birth Cohort 1934-44 Study.A cohort of 778 participants born after normotensive, pre-eclamptic, or hypertensive pregnancies, defined based on the mother's blood pressure and urinary protein measurements at maternity clinics and birth hospitals.Pearson's chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression.Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Older Adult Self-Report scores, completed at age 69.3 years (SD 3.1 years).Compared with offspring born after normotensive pregnancies, offspring born after pre-eclamptic pregnancies had increased odds of reporting total problems (aOR 4.00, 95%CI 1.64-9.77) and problems of particular concern to clinicians (critical items; aOR 5.28, 95%CI 1.87-14.96), as well as: anxious/depressed, functional impairment, memory, thought, and irritable/disinhibited problems on syndrome scales; depressive, somatic, and psychotic problems on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders scales; and adjustment problems in relationship satisfaction with spouse/partner. Maternal hypertension without proteinuria was not consistently associated with adjustment and problems (total problems, aOR 1.08, 95%CI 0.75-1.57; critical items, aOR 1.58, 95%CI 0.91-2.72).Maternal hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, during a period of expectant treatment, carry an increased risk of problems in adaptive functioning and mental wellbeing in the offspring seven decades later. Being the longest follow-up on transgenerational consequences of maternal hypertensive disorders reported thus far, our study points to the life-time increased risk of an adverse intrauterine environment.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Male Urogenital
