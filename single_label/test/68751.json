{"id":68751,"title":"Sacrum index in children suffering from different grades of vesicoureteral reflux.","abstract":"This study aimed at evaluating the sacrum index in children suffering from different grades of vesicoureteral reflux. In this case-control study, according to VCUG results, children with grade III, IV and V refluxes entered the study. There were 76 children with history of urinary canal infection and normal VCUG. Sacrum index was measured in both groups and compared. There was a meaningful relationship between these two groups considering abnormality rate of the index (p = 0.001). The factor can be used as a predictive factor in determining prognosis of medical treatment and selecting those children candidate to surgery.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498825","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.369501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.363097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.205888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Vesicoureteral reflux","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicoureteral_reflux"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
