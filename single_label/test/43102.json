{"id":43102,"title":"An optimized patient-reported ulcerative colitis disease activity measure derived from the Mayo score and the simple clinical colitis activity index.","abstract":"There is a need for simple, noninvasive patient-driven disease assessment instruments in ulcerative colitis (UC). We sought to further assess and refine the previous described 6-point Mayo score.A cross-sectional study of 282 UC patients was conducted assessing the correlation of the 2 patient-reported Mayo score components (6-point Mayo score) with the simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) and a single Likert scale of patient-reported disease activity. Spearman's correlation, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) were calculated. A separate validation study in 59 UC patients was also conducted.Participants predominantly had long-standing disease (83%) and were in self-reported remission (63%). The 6-point Mayo score correlated well with the SCCAI (rho = 0.71; P < 0.0001) and patient-reported disease activity (rho = 0.65; P < 0.0001). Using a cutpoint of 1.5, the 6-point Mayo score had 83% sensitivity and 72% specificity for patient-defined remission, and 89% sensitivity and 67% specificity for SCCAI-defined remission (score, <2.5). The 6-point Mayo score and SCCAI had similar accuracy of predicting patient-defined remission (AUC = 0.84 and 0.87, respectively). Addition of the SCCAI general well-being question to the 6-point Mayo improved the predictive ability for patient-defined remission; and a new weighted score had an AUC of 0.89 in the development cohort and 0.93 in the validation cohort. The optimal cutpoint was 1.6.The patient-reported UC severity index that includes stool frequency, bleeding, and general well-being accurately measures clinical disease activity without requiring direct physician contact.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810138","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.651524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.544348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.508237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.383986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.334482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.224923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.197397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Addition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Refining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Rho","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Economic development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
