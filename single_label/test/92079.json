{"id":92079,"title":"Yolk embolism associated with trauma in vitellogenic sea turtles in Florida (USA): a review of 11 cases.","abstract":"Case information and postmortem examination findings are presented for 11 adult female sea turtles in reproductive form that died in Florida, USA. All had abundant, large vitellogenic follicles, and most were either gravid or had recently nested. Species included six loggerheads (Caretta caretta) and five green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Identified proximate causes of death included falls or entrapment by obstructions on nesting beaches, burial under collapsed dunes, and other traumatic injuries of different causes. Evidence of yolk embolization was found in 10 cases and suspected in an 11th turtle. Ten turtles also had various amounts of free intracoelomic yolk. Although the effects of yolk embolization are uncertain at this time, precedence of pathologic importance in other species suggests that embolism may complicate traumatic injuries, including seemingly minor events.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450066","annotations":[{"name":"Species","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.633523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.557549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Turtle","weight":0.532642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle"},{"name":"Loggerhead sea turtle","weight":0.509129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle"},{"name":"Sea turtle","weight":0.497399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_turtle"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.44099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Green sea turtle","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sea_turtle"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.306626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Glossary of terms associated with gravidity","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_terms_associated_with_gravidity"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.241231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Sea","weight":0.120329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Beach","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach"},{"name":"Egg yolk","weight":0.0952762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_yolk"},{"name":"Burial","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Dune","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune"},{"name":"Grammatical person","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person"},{"name":"Nest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest"},{"name":"Identified","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identified"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Entrapment","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Proximate and ultimate causation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Political freedom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
