{"id":67871,"title":"Cutaneous metastasis from prostate cancer in a nigerian: a case report and literature review.","abstract":"Prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy in Nigeria and most patients present with advanced and metastatic disease. Cutaneous metastasis from prostate cancer is rare worldwide and to our knowledge has not been previously reported in a native African. We hereby report a case in a 62-year-old Nigerian. CASE PRESENTATION AND MANAGEMENT: A 62-yr-old Nigeria man presented with 6 months history of lower urinary tract symptoms that culminated in urinary retention for which he was catheterized. He noticed multiple painless skin nodules about the same time on the neck and trunk. On examination, he had multiple cutaneous nodules on his neck, limbs and trunk. His prostate gland was enlarged, hard and irregular. Prostate biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. He had bilateral orchidectomy with progressive regression of the skin nodules. He had successful trial of voiding without a catheter 3 weeks after bilateral total orchidectomy.Cutaneous metastasis from prostate cancer is rare in native Africans despite the high incidence of the disease in this population. To our knowledge, this index case is the first report in a native African in the English literature.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579392","annotations":[{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.880059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Inguinal orchiectomy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_orchiectomy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.833959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.716211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Index case","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"English literature","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_literature"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Bilateral symmetry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}]}
