{"id":77030,"title":"Regulators of G protein signaling are up-regulated in aspirin-resistant platelets from patients with metabolic syndrome.","abstract":"G protein-coupled receptor signaling plays a crucial role in platelet function. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGSs), which accelerate the deactivation of G protein signaling, are expressed in platelets. However, RGS expression has not been studied in the context of aspirin resistance. We compared RGS mRNA levels in platelets from 39 aspirin-resistant patients and 50 aspirin-sensitive patients with metabolic syndrome. Although there were no clinical differences between the two groups, transcripts of RGS2, RGS10, and RGS18 were significantly higher in aspirin-resistant patients than in aspirin-sensitive patients. This study is the first to demonstrate that RGS transcripts are elevated in aspirin-resistant platelets from patients with metabolic syndrome.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855830","annotations":[{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"G protein","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.523117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.32165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Royal Geographical Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Geographical_Society"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Lincoln County Regulators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_County_Regulators"}]}
