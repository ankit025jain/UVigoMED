{"id":34862,"title":"Management of atopic dermatitis: are there differences between children and adults?","abstract":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) usually begins during infancy. In its classical form infantile AD involves the scalp, the face and the extensor surfaces of the extremities. However, it may present as erythroderma, which should exclude other differential diagnoses including metabolic and immunodeficiency disorders. In the management we have to consider the high ratio of body surface to body weight, which is associated with high absorption of topically applied drugs. Especially in early childhood off-label use is a common practice. This requires intensive educational work with parents.
