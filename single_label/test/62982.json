{"id":62982,"title":"Cyto-/genotoxic effects of the ethanol extract of Chan Su, a traditional Chinese medicine, in human cancer cell lines.","abstract":"Chan Su, an ethanolic extract from skin and parotid venom glands of the Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor, is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine for cancer therapy. Although the anti-cancer properties of Chan Su have been investigated, no information exists regarding whether Chan Su has genotoxic effects in cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to examine the cyto-/genotoxic effect of Chan Su in human breast carcinoma (MCF-7 cells), human lung carcinoma (A-549 cells), human T cell leukemia (Jurkat T cells), and normal human lymphocytes.Effects on the viability of MCF-7, A-549, Jurkat T cells, and normal lymphocytes were evaluated by Trypan blue exclusion assays. The DNA content in the sub-G1 region was detected by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. The genotoxicity of Chan Su was assessed by single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN assay).Chan Su significantly inhibited the viability of MCF-7, A-549, and Jurkat T cells dose dependently, but had no effect on normal human lymphocytes. Apoptotic death of the cancer cells was evident after treatment. Chan Su also induced genotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the comet and cytokinesis-block micronucleus assays.These findings suggest that Chan Su can induce apoptotic death of, and exert genotoxic effects on, MCF-7, A-549, and Jurkat T cells.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
