{"id":42878,"title":"Phase I/II trial of irinotecan and S-1 combination chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer.","abstract":"This study attempted to determine the therapeutic dosage of irinotecan and S-1 (IRIS) as a second-line treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC).S-1 was administered on days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle. Irinotecan was administered on days 1 and 15. The irinotecan dose was then escalated to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and the recommended dose at a fixed dosage of S-1 (80 or 65 mg·m(-2)·day(-1)). The S-1 dose was reduced to 65 mg·m(-2)·day(-1) when dose-limiting toxicities were observed at 80 mg·m(-2)· day(-1) and the irinotecan dose was increased.The recommended dose was 65 mg/m(2) for S-1 and 75 mg/m(2) for irinotecan. Twenty-one patients were treated at the recommended dose. The overall response rate was 28.6%.This modified IRIS regimen is considered effective with acceptable toxicities for advanced CRC resistant to treatment with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or uracil and tegafur/leucovorin.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820531","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.647956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.64303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.476702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Uracil","weight":0.447068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Convention on the Rights of the Child","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"History of cancer chemotherapy","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"}]}
