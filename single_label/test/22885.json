{"id":22885,"title":"Duration of protection after first dose of acellular pertussis vaccine in infants.","abstract":"Data on the effectiveness of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in the first 4 years of life are sparse. We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 1 and 2 doses of DTaP before 6 months of age and of 3 doses from 6 months of age in Australia, where, since 2003, a fourth dose is not given until 4 years.We matched reported pertussis cases aged 2 to 47 months between January 2005 and December 2009 to controls from a population-based immunization register by date of birth and region of residence. VE by number of doses and age group was calculated as (1 - odds ratio) Ã— 100%.VE against hospitalization increased from 55.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.7%-65.1%) for 1 dose before 4 months of age to 83.0% (95% CI, 70.2%-90.3%) for 2 doses before 6 months. The VE of 3 doses of DTaP against all reported pertussis was 83.5% (95% CI, 79.1%-87.8%) between 6 and 11 months, declining to 70.7% (95% CI, 64.5%-75.8%) between 2 and 3 years of age and 59.2% (95% CI, 51.0%-66.0%) between 3 and 4 years of age.DTaP provided good protection against pertussis in the first year of life from the first dose. Without a booster dose, the effectiveness of 3 doses waned more rapidly from 2 to 4 years of age than previously documented for children >6 years of age who had received 5 doses.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515514","annotations":[{"name":"Australia","weight":0.837028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.491153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"DPT vaccine","weight":0.293056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine"},{"name":"Pertussis","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.111848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.100451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pertussis vaccine","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_vaccine"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"765","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/765"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Birth certificate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_certificate"},{"name":"Sparse matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix"},{"name":"Child development stages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stages"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Non-cellular life","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life"}]}
