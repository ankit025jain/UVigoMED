{"id":46504,"title":"Wait-and-see policy versus cholecystectomy after endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile-duct stones in high-risk patients with co-existing gallbladder stones: a prospective randomised trial.","abstract":"Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is one of the most important advances in the treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones. However, the use of ES to remove CBD stones in high-risk patients without cholecystectomy is still debatable. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a wait-and-see policy versus cholecystectomy after ES for CBD stones in high-risk patients with co-existing cholelithiasis.A total of 162 patients after undergoing ES with the clearance of CBD stones were randomised after informed consent to cholecystectomy or conservative management of their gallbladder stones.The results indicated that cholecystectomy after ES for CBD stones significantly reduced the biliary complications in high-risk patients.Every patient who has both CBD stones and gallstones with significant co-morbid illnesses, after clearance of CBD stones by ES, should undergo early cholecystectomy.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630510","annotations":[{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.80305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.731065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.452062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.34415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Anal sphincterotomy","weight":0.0151958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sphincterotomy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Central business district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district"}]}
