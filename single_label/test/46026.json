{"id":46026,"title":"Oncologic outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer: a large-scale multicenter retrospective cohort study from China.","abstract":"Laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) has been indicated to be safe, feasible, and oncologically efficacious for the treatment of early gastric cancer by both retrospective and prospective studies. Although some reports have demonstrated that LAG was also a safe and technically feasible procedure for advanced gastric cancer (AGC), its oncologic outcomes have not yet been confirmed in a multicenter, large-scale study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncologic outcomes of LAG for AGC on a multicenter basis in China.Data of 1,184 consecutive patients with locally AGC who underwent LAG with curative intent between February 2003 and December 2009 were collected from the Chinese Laparoscopic Gastrointestinal Surgery Study group database and retrospectively analyzed. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for recurrence and survival were evaluated by Cox regression models.Postoperatively, 121 patients (10.2%) experienced complications, and 1 patient died (0.1%). Median follow-up was 12 months. Recurrence was observed in 185 patients (16.7%), including hematogenous (31 patients), peritoneal (52), locoregional (25), distant lymph node (LN) (8), mixed (63), and uncertain (6) recurrences. The cumulative 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 75.3 and 69.0%, respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 89.7 and 88.9% for stage I tumors, 85.0 and 77.0 % for stage II, 60.5 and 59.3% for stage III. Independent risk factors for recurrence were tumor size > 40 mm, intraoperative blood transfusion, and advanced tumor stage. For survival, age > 65 years, tumor size > 40 mm, and advanced tumor stage were independent risk factors.In addition to being safe and technically feasible, LAG for locally AGC could also yield acceptable short-term oncologic outcomes.","date":"2014-06-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651893","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.722717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"China","weight":0.632776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.574053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.445674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.425596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.382994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.341925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.304545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
