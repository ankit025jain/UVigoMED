{"id":34868,"title":"[Large intraosseous ganglion in the femoral condyle treated with resorbable cement: clinical case and differential diagnosis].","abstract":"We report a case of a very large intraosseous ganglion in a patient with Down's syndrome. The lesion was located in the medial femoral condyle and was diagnosed with imaging techniques (X-rays, CAT scan, bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging) that allowed measuring it. Treatment consisted of curettage and filling of the defect with the skeletal repair system carbonated apatite resorbable cement which allowed for immediate early weight bearing during the postoperative period in a non-cooperative patient. We think the location and size of the lesion are of interest, as well as the peculiarities of the patient, which may help understand the pathophysiology of this entity. As far as we know, the use of resorbable cement to treat this kind of lesions has not been reported.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701765","annotations":[{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.941928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Bone scintigraphy","weight":0.903692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_scintigraphy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.650644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.443034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.425994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.387979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.308774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.228971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.135513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Apatite","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medial condyle of femur","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_condyle_of_femur"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0214552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Carbonation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonation"}]}
