{"id":83311,"title":"CYP2D6 polymorphism and mental and personality disorders in suicide attempters.","abstract":"Prior studies on the association between the CYP2D6 polymorphism and suicide did not explore whether mental and personality disorders mediate this association. The main objective of the present study was to test an association between CYP2D6 polymorphism and mental and personality disorders among suicide attempters. The MINI and the DSM-IV version of the International Personality Disorder Examination Screening Questionnaire were used to diagnose mental and personality disorders, respectively, in 342 suicide attempters. Suicide attempters were divided into four groups according to their number of CYP2D6 active genes (zero, one, and two or more). Differences in mental and personality disorders across the four groups were measured using linear-by-linear association, chi square-test, and 95% confidence intervals. Suicide attempters carrying two or more active CYP2D6 genes were more likely to be diagnosed with at least one personality disorder than those with one or zero CYP2D6 active genes.
