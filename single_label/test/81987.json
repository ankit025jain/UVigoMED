{"id":81987,"title":"[Effect of preoperative anxiety level on postoperative pain sensation in patients receiving implant denture for partial edentulism].","abstract":"To explore the effect of preoperative anxiety level on postoperative pain sensation in partially edentulous patients undergoing surgery for implant denture.Eighty partially edentulous patients receiving implant denture were examined for preoperative anxiety level using State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) questionnaires before implantation surgery. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Present Pain Intensity (PPI) Questionnaire were used to assess the pain sensation in patients immediately after the operation. The correlations of preoperative state anxiety, trait anxiety, and dental anxiety with postoperative VAS score were analyzed. According to the assessment results of STAI, the patients were divided into little or no (score range 20-37) anxiety group (L group), moderate (38-44) anxiety group (M group), and high (45-80) anxiety group (H group) to analyze the effect of state anxiety and trait anxiety levels on postoperative pain sensation.Significantly positive correlations were found between preoperative state anxiety, trait anxiety and dental anxiety among the patients (P<0.01). Postoperative VAS score was positively correlated with trait anxiety score (P<0.01) and differed significantly between different trait anxiety groups (P<0.01). Compared with the patients in M and L groups, those in H group showed a significantly higher VAS score after the operation (P<0.05).The preoperative trait anxiety level is associated with postoperative pain sensation in partially edentulous patients receiving implant denture, suggesting the necessity of preoperative anxiety intervention in clinical practice.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752102","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.66417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.614749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.107968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"2037","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2037"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Trait theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"2010 FIFA World Cup Group H","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_H"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
