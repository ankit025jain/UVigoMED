{"id":42972,"title":"Expression and immunogenic analysis of recombinant polypeptides derived from capsid protein VP1 for developing subunit vaccine material against hepatitis A virus.","abstract":"Three recombinant polypeptides, VP1-His, VP1-3N-His, and 3D2-His, were produced by Escherichia coli expression system. Recombinant VP1-His, VP1-3N-His, and 3D2-His were expressed as bands with molecular weights of 32, 38, and 30 kDa, respectively. These were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA Fast-flow resin and/or ion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sepharose Fast-flow resin. Intraperitoneal immunizations of recombinant polypeptides successfully elicited the productions of VP1-His, VP1-3N-His, and 3D2-His specific IgG antibodies (IgG subclass distribution of IgG1>IgG2a>IgG2b>IgG3) in sera and induced the secretions of cytokines IFN-? and IL-6 in spleen cells. Sera from recombinant VP1-His-, VP1-3N-His-, and 3D2-His-immunized mice neutralized the propagation of HAV. The highest neutralizing activity was shown in sera from recombinant VP1-3N-His-immunized mice. These results suggest that recombinant VP1-3N-His can be a useful source for developing hepatitis A virus (HAV) subunit vaccine candidates.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816194","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Molecular mass","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Affinity chromatography","weight":0.776726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_chromatography"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.761904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.674395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.574094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.243137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.176834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"}]}
