{"id":24161,"title":"Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in HIV-negative patients: a prospective study with focus on immunosuppressive drugs and markers of immune impairment.","abstract":"Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is emerging in HIV-negative patients, for whom the prognosis is significantly worse than in HIV-infected patients and risk factors are poorly characterized. We performed an observational, multi-centre, prospective study of 56 consecutive cases of documented PCP in HIV-negative patients, and found that: (1) the main underlying conditions were haematological malignancies (43%), solid tumours (25%), inflammatory diseases (20%), and solid organ transplantation (7%); (2) most patients (80%) had received prolonged corticosteroids, with a mean daily dose of 47.3 ± 32.8 mg equivalent prednisone when PCP was diagnosed, and a mean cumulative dose of 5807 ± 5048 mg over the last 12 months; and (3) the median CD4 cell count was 0.12 × 10?/l (range 0.0-1.42), with a median CD4/CD8 ratio of 1.32 (0.0-6.4). These findings may be used to better target PCP prophylaxis according to the level of risk and contribute to decrease the burden of PCP in HIV-negative patients.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450839","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Pneumocystis pneumonia","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_pneumonia"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.772858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Pneumocystis jirovecii","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_jirovecii"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.608726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.136268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.133824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
