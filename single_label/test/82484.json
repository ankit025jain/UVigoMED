{"id":82484,"title":"Role of the MIR146A polymorphism in the origin and progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Gene expression and cell behavior are regulated by several factors, including small non-coding RNAs. MicroRNAs affecting cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis are thought to play an important role in tumorigenesis. The levels of miR-146 appear to be associated with cancer development and progression, including that of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this investigation was to ascertain whether the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2910164, mapping in the MIR146A gene, has a role in oral squamous cell carcinoma progression. A genetic association study was performed with a sample set of 346 oral squamous cell carcinomas collected in Italy. Our data indicate that the rs2910164 polymorphism is not associated with tumor development. However, a slight increase in the frequency of the variant allele was observed in Stage II tumors. Further investigations are needed to verify a possible role of the variant allele or rs2910164 in oral squamous cell carcinoma progression.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612133","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.762881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.71541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.665761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.567694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.462319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.454215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.355019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"}]}
