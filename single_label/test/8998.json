{"id":8998,"title":"Enhanced 4T1 breast carcinoma anticancer activity by co-delivery of doxorubicin and curcumin with core-shell drug-carrier based on heparin modified poly(L-lactide) grafted polyethylenimine cationic nanoparticles.","abstract":"Use of single chemotherapy agents has shown some limitations in anti-tumor treatment, such as development of drug resistance, severe adverse reactions and limited regime for therapeutic use. Combination of two or more therapeutic drugs is a feasible strategy to overcome these limitations. This paper reports study of co-delivery by core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) with hydrophobic PLLA core loaded with curcumin (Cur) and hydrophilic heparin shell adsorbing Doxorubicin (DOX). Characterizations of Cur-PEA NPs, Cur-PEA/heparin NPs and DOX adsorbing into Cur-PEA/heparin NPs (DOX-Cur NPs) were also investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Malvern Zetasizer. Studies on cellular uptake of DOX-Cur NPs demonstrated that both drugs were effectively taken up by 4T1 tumor cells. Furthermore, DOX-Cur NPs suppressed 4T1 tumor cells growth more efficiently than either DOX or Cur alone at the same concentrations, as measured by flow cytometry (FCM). We found out that intravenous injection of DOX-Cur NPs efficiently inhibited growth of subcutaneous 4T1 breast carcinoma in vivo (p < 0.01) and prolonged survival of the treated 4T1 breast carcinoma mice. Moreover, the pathological damage to the cardiac tissue in mice treated with DOX-Cur NPs was significantly less severe than that of mice treated with free DOX. This study suggested that DOX-Cur NPs may have promising applications in breast carcinoma therapy.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Animal
