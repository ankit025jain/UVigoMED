{"id":76415,"title":"Effectiveness and safety of a high-dose weekly vitamin D (20,000 IU) protocol in older adults living in residential care.","abstract":"To report 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations, an indicator of vitamin D status, in older adults living in residential care 1 year after a protocol of weekly 20,000 IU of vitamin D was started.Cross-sectional.Five residential care facilities in British Columbia, Canada.Residents aged 65 and older from five facilities (N=236).Participants provided a blood sample. Demographic and health information was obtained from the medical record.Mean 25OHD was 102 nmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI)=98-106 nmol/L). Three percent of residents had a 25OHD concentration of less than 40 nmol/L, 6% <50 nmol/L, and 19% <75 nmol/L. In those who received 20,000 IU/wk or more for 6 months or longer (n=147), mean 25OHD was 112 nmol/L (95% CI=108-117 nmol/L), and none had a 25OHD level of less than 50 nmol/L. Hypercalcemia (>2.6 mmol/L), a potential consequence of too much vitamin D, was present in 14%, although 25OHD levels did not differ in those with and without hypercalcemia (108 vs 101 nmol/L; P=.17).Twelve months after implementation of a 20,000-IU/wk vitamin D protocol for older adults in residential care, mean 25OHD concentrations were high, and there was no evidence of poor vitamin D status. Given the absence of demonstrated benefit of high 25OHD concentrations to the residential care population, dosages less than 20,000 IU/wk of vitamin D are recommended.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039913","annotations":[{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.471137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.367656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.28053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hypercalcaemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalcaemia"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Columbia University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Care of residents","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_of_residents"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Residential area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_area"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"}]}
