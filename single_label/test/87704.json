{"id":87704,"title":"Tissue engineered poly(caprolactone)-chitosan-poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibrous scaffolds for burn and cutting wound healing.","abstract":"Natural-synthetic blend nanofibres have recently attracted more interest because of the ability of achieving desirable properties. Poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL)-chitosan (Cs)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) blend nanofibrous scaffolds were electrospun in 2:1:1.33 mass ratio of PCL:Cs:PVA. The presence of PCL in the blend leads to improvement in web hydrophobicity and helped the web to retain its integrity in aqueous media. The scaffolds were used in two forms of acellular and with mesenchymal stem cells. They were applied on burn (n = 12) and excisional cutting (n = 12) wounds on dorsum skin of rats. Macroscopic investigations were carried out to measure the wounds areas. It was found that the area of wounds that were treated with cell-seeded nanofibrous scaffolds were smaller compared to other samples. Pathological results showed much better healing performance for cell-seeded scaffolds followed by acellular scaffolds compared with control samples. All these results indicate that PCL:Cs:PVA nanofibrous web would be a proper material for burn and cutting wound healing.
