{"id":73983,"title":"Breast cancer screening among women of child-bearing age.","abstract":"We explored behavioral factors that contributed to late presentation of breast cancer. A cross-sectional survey of 120 women of child-bearing age was employed, and data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires addressing predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors associated with breast cancer screening. A total of 53.5% knew what breast cancer screening was; breast self-exam was the most commonly known form of screening, although only 7.5% practiced it. Lack of awareness (p =.004) and the knowledge of someone who previously had breast cancer (pÂ =.0004) were prominent predictors for breast cancer screening, leading to either delay in or early presentation of the condition, respectively.
