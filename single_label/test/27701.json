{"id":27701,"title":"Multi-dimensional self-esteem and substance use among Chinese adolescents.","abstract":"Substance use among adolescents has caused worldwide public health concern in recent years. Overseas studies have demonstrated an association between adolescent self-esteem and substance use, but studies within a Chinese context are limited. A study was therefore initiated to: (1) explore the 30Â days prevalence of substance use (smoking, drinking, and drugs) among male and female adolescents in Hong Kong; (2) identify the significant associations between multidimensional self-esteem and gender; and (3) examine the relationship between multi-dimensional self-esteem and substance use.A self-esteem scale and the Chinese version of the global school-based student health survey were adopted. A total of 1,223 students were recruited from two mixed-gender schools and one boys' school.Among females, there was a lower 30-day prevalence of cigarette, alcohol, and drug use. They also had significantly higher peer and family self-esteem but lower sport-related self-esteem. Body image self-esteem was a predictor of alcohol use among females, while peer and school self-esteem were predictors of drug use among males.In summary, the findings demonstrated the influence of self-esteem to the overall well-being of adolescents. Schools could play a role in promoting physical fitness and positive relationships between adolescents and their peers, family, and schools to fulfill their physical and psychological self-esteem needs.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269693","annotations":[{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.777071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Self-esteem","weight":0.640531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.513683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.475431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"School","weight":0.461002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"China","weight":0.401674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.379276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.277288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.10474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.070898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
