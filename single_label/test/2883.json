{"id":2883,"title":"[Taufon use in myopic contact lens wearers].","abstract":"To investigate the potential clinical efficacy of Taufon eye drops in silicone hydrogel soft contact lens wearers with nonprogressive myopia.A total of 90 patients with non-progressive myopia aged from 28 to 45 years were divided in 3 homogeneous groups (30 patients in each). For vision correction silicone hydrogel Air Optix Night & Day (\"Ciba Vision\") and Pure Vision 2HD (\"Bausch & Lomb\") contact lenses were used. The average period of contact lens wear was 5.5 +/- 3.3 years. Apart from conventional ophthalmic assessment, all patients underwent a complex lacrimal system examination, which included Schirmer's test and tear film break-up time (TBUT). The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was used for dry eye symptoms assessment. The condition of the corneal epithelium was evaluated after 0.2% fluorescein instillation. Group 1 patients received 4% Taufon eye drops, group 2--natural tears (\"Alcon\"). Group 3 patients did not use any eye drops at all.Baseline Schirmer's test results, TBUT, and OSDI score were similar in all groups (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Drug therapy was considered effective if Schirmer's test result remained > 10 mm, TBUT--not less than 10 sec, OSDI--not more than 15, there were positive dynamics or at least no negative changes in dry eye signs and symptoms. The patients from group 1 presented no subjective complaits and their corneal and conjunctival changes were less significant than that in other groups (p < 0.05). Regression of dry eye signs at biomicroscopy in this group was confirmed by Schirmer's test results, TBUT, and OSDI. In groups 2 and 3 dry eye sings were more pronounced.The study of the 4% Taufon eye drops efficacy for dry eye prevention in silicone hydrogel Air Optix Night & Day and Pure Vision 2HD contact lens wearers with non-progressive myopia showed that the clinical effect was more significant in the treatment group (group 1) as compared to both group 2 (natural tear) and 3 (p < 0.05).","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306731","annotations":[{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Corneal epithelium","weight":0.782831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_epithelium"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Ciba Vision","weight":0.68075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciba_Vision"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Corrective lens","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_lens"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.492869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.466442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.429365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hydrogel","weight":0.376173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogel"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.274145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Alcon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcon"},{"name":"Lacrimal apparatus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_apparatus"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Novartis","weight":0.0278474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"}]}
