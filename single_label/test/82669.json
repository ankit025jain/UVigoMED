{"id":82669,"title":"Lingual orthodontics: accelerated realignment of the \"social six\" with piezocision.","abstract":"Despite the growing number of adults interested in improving their smiles through orthodontic treatment, the visual impact and the duration of the treatment itself are frequently obstacles to patient acceptance. A treatment that is fast and less visible is a desirable option that adult patients often request of their orthodontists. Presented in this case report, which involves a young woman who wanted treatment completed in a limited amount of time, is a new application of a minimally invasive surgical approach to accelerate orthodontic movement combined with a simplified 2-dimensional lingual orthodontic treatment to resolve mild crowding in the anterior region, otherwise known as the \"social six.\".
