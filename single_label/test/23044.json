{"id":23044,"title":"Future directions for anti-biofilm therapeutics targeting Candida.","abstract":"While proliferating in its most common mode of growth, a biofilm, Candida spp. exhibit increased resistance to available antifungal agents. These adherent communities are difficult to eradicate and often responsible for treatment failures. New therapies are urgently needed to treat a variety of Candida biofilm infections in the medical setting. This review discusses the medical relevance of Candida biofilms, the drug resistance associated with this mode of growth, and approaches to combat these resilient infections.
