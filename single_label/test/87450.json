{"id":87450,"title":"[Skin tear treatment and prevention by nurses: an integrative literature review].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to identify scientific evidence in the literature regarding management and prevention of skin tears by nurses over the last ten years. This is an integrative review of articles found in the LILACS, SciELO, BDENF, MEDLINE, Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed databases, identified with the Portuguese, English and Spanish descriptors for \"skin,\" \"friction,\" or with the keyword \"skin tears\". After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, fifteen texts were selected. Scientific evidence demonstrated that the best management results are obtained by covering the tear with the skin flap itself, using octylcyanoacrylate or silicone-based products. Prevention consists of promoting a safe environment, through multidisciplinary work and health education. We conclude that it is the nursing staffs responsibility to avoid infection, trauma of any intensity, pain and bleeding.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158474","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.551199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.481855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.479566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.430164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.222103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"ScienceDirect","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScienceDirect"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Editor-in-chief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
