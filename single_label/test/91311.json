{"id":91311,"title":"Individualizing osteoporosis medications.","abstract":"Mrs. JD is a 58-year-old postmenopausal woman having symptoms of hot flashes and night sweats. She has a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry T-score of -2.4 in the femoral neck, consistent with low bone mass or osteopenia. She has a parental history of hip fracture. FRAX shows the 10-year absolute risk of major osteoporotic fracture equal to 18% and the 10-year risk of hip fracture above 3% at 3.2%, which meets the National Osteoporosis Foundation threshold. Mrs. JD is taking calcium 1,200 mg, between supplement and diet, and 1,000 IU vitamin D3 daily.
