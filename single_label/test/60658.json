{"id":60658,"title":"Monitoring molecular response to tyrosine kinase therapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","abstract":"The dramatic decline in mortality rates in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a direct result of the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the dawning of the targeted era. Although many patients experience long-term benefits from imatinib or related agents, problems with resistance and tolerance dampen the outcomes for many others. During his presentation at the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. Jerald Radich reviewed the ever-expanding menu of TKIs for CML and shared his thoughts on resolving the clinical questions regarding when to start which drugs, how to sequence the drugs, and how best to decide when to change the therapeutic tack.
