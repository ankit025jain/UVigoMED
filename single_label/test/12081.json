{"id":12081,"title":"Reversing the deleterious effects of ?2-antiplasmin on tissue plasminogen activator therapy improves outcomes in experimental ischemic stroke.","abstract":"High blood levels of ?2-antiplasmin have been associated with failed tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) therapy for ischemic stroke. Yet, other data suggests that ?2-antiplasmin may be protective in stroke, because it defends against bleeding and excitotoxicity. To address this paradox, we examined the effects of high ?2-antiplasmin levels and ?2-antiplasmin inactivation in mice treated with TPA 0.5-2.5h after middle cerebral artery (MCA) thromboembolism. Brain infarction, swelling, hemorrhage, blood brain barrier breakdown and neuronal apoptosis were measured by a blinded observer. Thrombus dissolution was determined by gamma counting. During TPA treatment, high ?2-antiplasmin blood levels increased brain infarction (2.2-fold) and swelling (3.7-fold), but decreased MCA thrombus dissolution. Conversely, ?2-antiplasmin inactivation during TPA treatment reduced brain infarction, hemorrhage and swelling, but increased MCA thrombus dissolution. Inactivation of ?2-antiplasmin during TPA treatment reduced neuronal apoptosis and blood brain barrier breakdown. Inactivation of ?2-antiplasmin also reduced short-term mortality. Taken together these data show that ?2-antiplasmin opposes the effects of TPA therapy and contributes to enhanced brain injury after experimental thromboembolic stroke. Conversely, ?2-antiplasmin inactivation during TPA treatment improves thrombus dissolution and reduces brain infarction, swelling and hemorrhage. Consistent with clinical observations, these data suggest that ?2-antiplasmin exerts deleterious effects that reduce the efficacy and safety of TPA therapy for ischemic stroke.
