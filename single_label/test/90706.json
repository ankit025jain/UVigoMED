{"id":90706,"title":"[Treatment for a chronic proximal interphalangeal fracture-dislocation with hemi-hamate arthroplasty].","abstract":"Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint are complex and challenging to manage once they become chronic. We report a case of PIP joint fracture-dislocation treated by hemi-hamate arthroplasty. An 18-year-old male polytrauma patient presented with a neglected PIP joint fracture-dislocation in the third finger of the left hand. After four months of follow-up, he remained disabled due to clinodactyly and stiffness. After performing a cadaver study to evaluate the feasibility of grafting, we resurfaced the bone-cartilage defect with a hemi-hamate arthroplasty. The range of motion at the last follow-up was 65Â° without pain; the DASH score was 2.27. The patient was able to return to heavy manual labour work at 5 months postoperative.
