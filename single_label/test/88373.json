{"id":88373,"title":"Urotrauma: AUA guideline.","abstract":"The authors of this guideline reviewed the urologic trauma literature to guide clinicians in the appropriate methods of evaluation and management of genitourinary injuries.A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® and EMBASE databases (search dates 1/1/90-9/19/12) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to urotrauma. The review yielded an evidence base of 372 studies after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to inform the statements presented in the guideline as Standards, Recommendations or Options. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians on the initial observation, evaluation and subsequent management of renal, ureteral, bladder, urethral and genital traumatic injuries.Genitourinary organ salvage has become increasingly possible as a result of advances in imaging, minimally invasive techniques, and reconstructive surgery. As the field of genitourinary reconstruction continues to evolve, clinicians must strive to approach clinical problems in a creative, multidisciplinary, evidence-based manner to ensure optimal outcomes.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857651","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.6622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.629661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.391224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.252321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.205801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0822457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"American Urological Association","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Urological_Association"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
