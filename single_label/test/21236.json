{"id":21236,"title":"The Sepsis in Obstetrics Score: a model to identify risk of morbidity from sepsis in pregnancy.","abstract":"We sought to design an emergency department sepsis scoring system to identify risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in pregnant and postpartum women.The Sepsis in Obstetrics Score (S.O.S.) was created by modifying validated scoring systems in accordance with recognized physiologic changes of pregnancy. The S.O.S. was applied to a retrospective cohort of pregnant and postpartum patients from February 2009 through May 2011 with clinical suspicion of sepsis. The primary outcome was ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were telemetry unit admission, length of stay, positive blood cultures, positive influenza swabs, perinatal outcome, and maternal mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to estimate the optimal score for identification of risk of ICU admission.In all, 850 eligible women were included. There were 9 ICU (1.1%) and 32 telemetry (3.8%) admissions, and no maternal deaths. The S.O.S. had an area under the curve of 0.97 for ICU admission. An S.O.S. ?6 (maximum score 28) had an area under the curve of 0.92 with sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 95.2%, positive predictive value of 16.7%, and negative predictive value of 99.9% for ICU admission, with an adjusted odds ratio of 109 (95% confidence interval, 18-661). An S.O.S. ?6 was independently associated with increased ICU or telemetry unit admissions, positive blood cultures, and fetal tachycardia.A sepsis scoring system designed specifically for an obstetric population appears to reliably identify patients at high risk for admission to the ICU. Prospective validation is warranted.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613756","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.930781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.777672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.748581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.745783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.741068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.676384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.644095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.587637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.472112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.30477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Telemetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Medical algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.0137002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"}]}
