{"id":34370,"title":"A review on the cause-effect relationship between oxidative stress and toxic proteins in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","abstract":"Protein aggregates are the defining pathological feature of human neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have revealed that mutant huntingtin, polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 can cause elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in neuronal cells. It has also been indicated that the normal host prion protein behaves as an antioxidant, while the neurotoxic peptide based on the sequence of the scrapie isoform increases hydrogen peroxide toxicity in neuronal cultures. Additionally, not only can oxidative stress contribute to the aggregation of beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein, but both beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein can induce oxidative damage. Furthermore, oxidative stressors have been shown to play a critical role in neurofibrillary pathology leading to tau hyperphosphorylation. In conclusion, the present review supports a cause-effect relationship between oxidative stress and toxic proteins in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741770","annotations":[{"name":"Prion","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.77681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.727131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hyperphosphorylation","weight":0.615966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperphosphorylation"},{"name":"Tau protein","weight":0.440411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.363784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Scrapie","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapie"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
