{"id":4968,"title":"[Analysis of tendon injuries accompanying distal radius fractures using volar locking plates].","abstract":"We examined 6 cases of tendon injuries that accompanied distal radius fractures using volar locking plate between April 2006 and March 2012. Male: one case, female: five cases, average age 57.0 (33~70) years old. The fracture type was A2 in one case, A3 in four cases, and C2 in one case by AO classification. The average period for operation waiting was 2.7 days. We analyzed the time of occurrence of tendon rupture (extensor pollicis longus (EPL)?flexor pollicis longus (FPL)), the existence or not of screw prominence and dorsal roof fragment, and the positioning of the plate setting. The tendon ruptures were EPL in four cases, and FPL in two cases. The average period of rupture occurrence was 86.8 (1~182) days. In four EPL tendon ruptures we recognized one marked screw prominence (16.7%), and two dorsal roof fragments (50%), both showing widespread displacement. Moreover, we recognized the malposition of the plate setting in the two cases of FPL tendon rupture (100%). The incidence of tendon ruptures accompanying distal radius fractures using volar locking plates was not low at all, therefore we should more pay attention to the prevention of this occurrence.
