{"id":90062,"title":"Cognitive recovery after severe traumatic brain injury in children/adolescents and adults: similar positive outcome but different underlying pathways?","abstract":"Does younger age at the time of severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) protect from cognitive symptoms? To answer this question, the authors compared the neuropsychological profile of late school-age children/adolescents and young adult patients at mid- and long-term recovery periods (6 and 12 months post-STBI).Twenty-eight children/adolescents and 26 clinically matched adults were tested on measures of general intelligence, attention, executive functions, visuoperceptual, visuospatial and visuoconstructive abilities. Coma duration and the post-acute Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score were used as predictor variables in a series of regression analyses.Children/adolescents and adults similarly improved on most measures, except for visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills, which worsened in time for children/adolescents. Coma duration significantly predicted performance IQ and visuoperceptual scores in children/adolescents. The GOS score significantly predicted performance and verbal IQ, sustained attention, visuoconstructive and long-term memory skills. Coma duration predicted executive function skills in both age groups.(1) No evidence was found for a neuroprotective effect of younger age at STBI; and (2) Coma duration and GOS score predicted neuropsychological recovery in children/adolescents and adults, respectively. This suggests the existence of underlying age-specific recovery processes after STBI.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655151","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Executive functions","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.71243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Spatial-temporal reasoning","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial-temporal_reasoning"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.567113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.384722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale","weight":0.31452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0787183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Global Ocean Sampling Expedition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Ocean_Sampling_Expedition"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Young adult (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_(psychology)"},{"name":"Senior management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_management"},{"name":"G factor (psychometrics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"}]}
