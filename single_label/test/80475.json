{"id":80475,"title":"Comparison of three immunoassays for detection of antibodies to Strongyloides stercoralis.","abstract":"Due to the limited sensitivities of stool-based microscopy and/or culture techniques for Strongyloides stercoralis, the detection of antibodies to this intestinal nematode is relied upon as a surrogate for determining exposure status or making a diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection. Here, we evaluated three immunoassays, including the recently released InBios Strongy Detect IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (InBios International, Inc., Seattle, WA), the SciMedx Strongyloides serology microwell ELISA (SciMedx Corporation, Denville, NJ), and the luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for their detection of IgG antibodies to S. stercoralis. A total of 101 retrospective serum samples, previously submitted for routine S. stercoralis antibody detection using the SciMedx assay, were also evaluated by the InBios and LIPS assays. The qualitative results from each assay were compared using a Venn diagram analysis, to the consensus result among the three assays, and each ELISA was also evaluated using the LIPS assay as the reference standard. By Venn diagram analysis, 65% (66/101) of the samples demonstrated perfect agreement by all three assays. Also, the numbers of samples considered positive or negative by a single method were similar. Compared to the consensus result, the overall percent agreement of the InBios, SciMedx, and LIPS assays were comparable at 87.1%, 84.2%, and 89.1%, respectively. Finally, the two ELISAs performed analogously but demonstrated only moderate agreement (kappa coefficient for the two assays, 0.53) with the LIPS assay. Collectively, while the two commercially available ELISAs perform equivalently, neither should be used independently of clinical evaluation to diagnose strongyloidiasis.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648484","annotations":[{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.731786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.504047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Strongyloides stercoralis","weight":0.375442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongyloides_stercoralis"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.250137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"New Jersey","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"},{"name":"Strongyloidiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongyloidiasis"},{"name":"Seattle","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle"},{"name":"Venn diagram","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"}]}
