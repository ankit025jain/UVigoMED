{"id":84114,"title":"Independent assessment of a new pedicle probe and its ability to detect pedicle breach: a cadaveric study.","abstract":"The authors undertook an independent, non-industry funded cadaveric study to evaluate the efficacy of a pedicle-probing device, which uses impedance measurement to warn of impending and actual pedicle screw breach.A previously validated fresh-frozen cadaver model (saline-soaked spine) was used. Individuals at 3 levels of training (attending spine surgeon, orthopedic surgery resident, and medical student) used a cannulated pedicle-probing device to cannulate each of the levels between T-2 and S-1. Each pedicle was cannulated freehand using 2 approaches: 1) a standard trajectory through the middle of the pedicle, and 2) a medial trajectory aimed to breach the medial wall of the pedicle. A 16-slice helical CT scanner was used. The images were interpreted and analyzed by 2 orthopedic spine surgeons and a neuroradiologist.The sensitivity of the pedicle probe to detect impending breach or breach of 4 mm or less was 90.06%. The sensitivity in detecting medial wall breach was 95.8%. The positive predictive value was 87.1%. The device detected medial breach more often than lateral breach.This study showed that this pedicle-probing device could reasonably be used to detect impending breach and actual breach of 4 mm or less. Medial breach was detected better than lateral breach. Use of the pedicle probe may improve patient safety.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25170653","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.826578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.752037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.574467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.466814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.381569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.284623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.216595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Medical student","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_student"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Whale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Nasal septum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
