{"id":74117,"title":"The effects of Salacia reticulata on anti-cellular oxidants and melanogenesis inhibition in alpha-MSH-stimulated and UV irradiated B16 melanoma cells.","abstract":"The purposes of this study were to investigate the inhibitory effects of Salacia reticulata Tul. root extract on cellular oxidants and melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells. Cells treated with non-toxic doses of S. reticulata root extract were investigated for their effects on melanogenesis, cellular tyrosinase activity and cellular oxidant scavenging activity. The results indicated that S. reticulata extract inhibited melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in alpha-MSH-induced or UV-irradiated B16 melanoma cells in a dose dependent manner. Additionally, the extract also exhibited anti-cellular oxidants in UV-induced radical melanoma cells. Altogether, these results suggested that S. reticulata root extract has roles in suppression of melanogenesis and oxidant inhibition. S. reticulata root extract may be a potential source for the development of pharmaceutical products for treatment of skin hyperpigmentation disorders.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868882","annotations":[{"name":"Melanin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin"},{"name":"Tyrosinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosinase"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.795414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oxidizing agent","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.664316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Melanogenesis","weight":0.258777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanogenesis"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.256585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Hyperpigmentation","weight":0.236814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpigmentation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"}]}
