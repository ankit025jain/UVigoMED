{"id":87043,"title":"Mitophagy in viral infections.","abstract":"Antiviral innate immune responses and apoptosis are the two major factors limiting viral infections. Successful viral infection requires the virus to take advantage of the cellular machinery to bypass cellular defenses. Accumulated evidences show that autophagy plays a crucial role in cell-to-virus interaction. Here, we focus on how viruses subvert mitophagy to favor viral replication by mitigating innate immune responses and apoptotic signaling.
