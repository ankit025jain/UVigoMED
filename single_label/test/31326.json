{"id":31326,"title":"[Familial Mediterranean fever (paroxismal polyserositis, familial recurring polyserositis, periodic disease)].","abstract":"Paroxismal polyserositis is an orphan disease most often affecting Mediterranean populations. It is caused by a mutation on chromosome 16 leading to pyrine synthesis disorder. The disease has a characteristic clinical picture, the most prominent manifestation being recurrent aseptic inflammation of serous membranes especially in peritoneum, marked temperature reaction, and apparent spontaneous recovery in the attack-free period. Inadequate or excessively intense treatment may cause complication in the form of secondary amyloidosis of internal organs. The most effective therapeutic modality is daily intake of colchicine at a dose of 1-1.5 mg.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269192","annotations":[{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.847626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Amyloidosis","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.581271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Colchicine","weight":0.563317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.487592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Familial Mediterranean fever","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_Mediterranean_fever"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.366768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.306422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.230438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0644769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chromosome 16 (human)","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_16_(human)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Orphan","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan"}]}
