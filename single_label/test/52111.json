{"id":52111,"title":"Incident user cohorts for assessing medication cost-offsets.","abstract":"To develop and test incident drug user designs for assessing cost savings from statin use in diabetics.Random 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries, 2006-2008.Seven-step incident user design to assess impact of statin initiation on subsequent Medicare spending: (1) unadjusted pre/post initiation test; (2) unadjusted difference-in-difference (DID) with comparison series; (3) adjusted DID; (4) propensity score (PS)-matched DID with static and dynamic baseline covariates; (5) PS-matched DID by drug adherence strata; (6) PS-matched DID for high adherers controlling for healthy adherer bias; and (7) replication for ACE-inhibitor/ARB initiators.Subjects with prevalent diabetes and no statin use (January-June 2006) and statin initiation (July 2006-January 2008) compared to nonusers with a random \"potential-initiation\" month. Monthly Medicare spending tracked 24 months pre- and post-initiation.Statistically significant savings in Medicare spending were observed beginning 7 months post-initiation for statins and 13 months post-initiation for ACEIs/ARBs. However, these savings were only observed for adherent patients in steps 5 and 6.Drug initiator designs are more robust to confounding than prevalent user designs in assessing cost-offsets from drug use but still require other adjustments and sensitivity analysis to ensure proper inference.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628528","annotations":[{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.57403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.434085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.407225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.399318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.375506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.335508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.266711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Tritium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Dissociative identity disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Continuous track","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_track"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Psychodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Beneficiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary"}]}
