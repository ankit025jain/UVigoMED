{"id":54217,"title":"The effect of earlier puberty on cardiometabolic risk factors in Afro-Caribbean children.","abstract":"An earlier onset of puberty is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. We investigated whether this relation was independent of faster childhood growth or current size in an Afro-Caribbean birth cohort (n=259). Anthropometry was measured at birth and then 6-monthly. Tanner staging started at age 8 years. Cardiometabolic risk factors were measured at mean age 11.5 years. In boys, pubarchal stage and testicular size were associated with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher systolic blood pressure, and higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score, but not after adjusting for current body mass index (BMI) or rate of growth (up to age 8 years). In girls, earlier menarche and greater breast development were associated with higher fasting glucose even after adjusting for current BMI or prior growth. Pubarchal stage was associated with systolic blood pressure, even after adjusting for current BMI and prior growth. We concluded that earlier puberty is independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in girls but not in boys.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468602","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.810008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Menarche","weight":0.765266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menarche"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.557982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Precocious puberty","weight":0.550287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.493984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Tanner scale","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_scale"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.339581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.165536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"}]}
