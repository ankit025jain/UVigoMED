{"id":86179,"title":"Protracted dosing of the lipophilic camptothecin analogue AR-67 in non-small cell lung cancer xenografts and humans.","abstract":"Although preclinical studies on camptothecin antitumor effect have demonstrated the superiority of low-dose protracted dosing, these findings were not replicated in the clinic. 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (AR-67) is a camptothecin analogue currently under investigation in early phase clinical trials. To maximize the therapeutic potential of AR-67, we sought to identify factors that affect response to treatment.After determining the maximum tolerated dose using neutropenia as a toxicity endpoint, xenografts received AR-67 under varying dosing schedules and were monitored for survival. On the last treatment day, tumor tissue was collected and topoisomerase 1 (Top1), ?H2AX, caspase 3 and PARP protein content was evaluated. AR-67 plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics were also studied in mice and cancer patients who were administered AR-67 as a 1-h intravenous infusion on days 1, 4, 8, 12 and 15 every 21 days.Low-dose protracted dosing schedules increased animal survival compared to less frequent, but higher-dose courses and the expression of Top1 and ?H2AX were schedule dependent. Fatigue and neutropenia were the dose-limiting toxicities identified in patients receiving AR-67. Finally, elimination of AR-67 from the tumor site was slower in both xenografts and tumor of a patient enrolled in the pilot clinical trial.We demonstrated that low-dose protracted dosing schedules of AR-67 are therapeutically effective and Top1 reflects the biological activity of AR-67 in xenografts. Moreover, the tumor pharmacokinetics as well as the efficacy and safety of AR-67 given intermittently to cancer patients warrant further investigation.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807458","annotations":[{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lipophilicity","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophilicity"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.705716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.642155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.62549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.619073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Camptothecin","weight":0.513317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camptothecin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.318321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Topoisomerase","weight":0.295147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Type I topoisomerase","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_topoisomerase"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"}]}
