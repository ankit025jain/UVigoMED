{"id":89593,"title":"[Fractures of the mid third of the clavicle. Results after osteosynthesis].","abstract":"The traditional idea that most fractures of the mid third of the clavicle heal with a good functional outcome after orthopedic treatment is increasingly controversial due to the publication of studies reporting high pseudoarthrosis rates and functional limitations in certain subpopulations. Our objective is to analyze the results obtained with open reduction and internal fixation with low profile plates for the treatment of these fractures.We conducted an observational, retrospective, cohort study of the patients who underwent surgery for displaced fracture of the mid third between January 2006 and December 2009. They all were radiologically and functionally assessed using the Constant and disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand scales.Surgical treatment of displaced fractures of the mid third of the clavicle with low profile plates using a meticulous technique results in low intra- and postoperative complication rates, with a mean healing rate of 4 months. The Constant score in the affected arm compared with the healthy one was 93.41% in the subjective assessment and 96% in the objective one.The good functional results obtained lead us to recommend this type of treatment, mainly in certain subpopulations (young and active patients).","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701768","annotations":[{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.684048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.474758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.276781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.272304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Pseudarthrosis","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudarthrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.122756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"The Constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constant"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Lithography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"}]}
