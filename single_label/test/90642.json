{"id":90642,"title":"Interleukin-6 as inflammatory marker referring to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in severely injured children.","abstract":"Despite the suggestion that the inflammatory response in traumatized children is functionally unique, prognostic markers predicting pediatric multiple organ failure are lacking. We intended to verify whether Interleukin-6 (IL-6) displays a pivotal role in pediatric trauma similar to adults.Traumatized children less than 18 years of age with an Injury Severity Score >9 points and consecutive admission to the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit were included. Organ function was evaluated according to the score by Marshall et al. while IL-6 levels were measured repetitively every morning.59 traumatized children were included (8.4 Â± 4.4 years; 57.6% male gender). Incidence of MODS was 11.9%. No differences were found referring to age, gender, injury distribution or overall injury severity between children with and without MODS. Increased IL-6 levels during hospital admission were associated with injury severity (Spearman correlation: r = 0.522, p < 0.001), while an inconsistent association towards the development of MODS was proven at that time point (Spearman correlation: r = 0.180, p = 0.231; Pearson's correlation: r = 0.297, p = 0.045). However, increased IL-6 levels during the first two days were no longer associated with the injury severity but a significant correlation to MODS was measured.The presented prospective study is the first providing evidence for a correlation of IL-6 levels with injury severity and the incidence of MODS in traumatized children.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589345","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.700162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.500046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.454795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.330838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.241976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Spearman, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman,_Texas"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"}]}
