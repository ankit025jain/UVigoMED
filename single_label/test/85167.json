{"id":85167,"title":"[Influence of huatanjiangqi prescription on multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 in human bronchial epithelial cells].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of Huatanjiangqi prescription (Sinapis Semen, Perillae Fructus, Cynanchi Stauntonii Rhizoma et Radix, Inulae Herba, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Honey-fried Ephedrae Herba) on multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) in human bronchial epithelial cells.The human bronchial epithelial cells line 16HBE140- was used to analyze the in vitro effect of Huatanjiangqi prescription on MRP1 transport. 5-CFDA was used as a model MRP1 substrate and was measured with flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of MRP1 was detected by real-time PCR.Huatanjiangqi prescription could promote the proliferation of human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE140- in a certain range of concentration; Compared with the control group (5-CFDA), low, medium and high concentration (100, 1 000, 2 000 microg/mL) of Huatanjiangqi prescription on MRP1 function were increased by 22.59%, 47.14% and 68.36%, respectively; Huatanjiangqi prescription could concentration-dependently induce the expression of MRP1 mRNA, medium and high concentration could induce a significant difference.Huatanjiangqi prescription can improve MRP1 efflux function and mRNA levels in a concetration-dependent manner.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095351","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.683877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.305312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Council of Fashion Designers of America","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Fashion_Designers_of_America"},{"name":"Sinapis","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinapis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Efflux (microbiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efflux_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Group 5 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_5_element"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
