{"id":81701,"title":"Supervised method for periodontitis phenotypes prediction based on microbial composition using 16S rRNA sequences.","abstract":"Microbes play an important role on human health, however, little is known on microbes in the past decades for the limitation of culture-based techniques. Recently, with the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, it is now possible to sequence millions of sequences directly from environments samples, and thus it supplies us a sight to probe the hidden world of microbial communities and detect the associations between microbes and diseases. In the present work, we proposed a supervised learning-based method to mine the relationship between microbes and periodontitis with 16S rRNA sequences. The jackknife accuracy is 94.83% and it indicated the method can effectively predict disease status. These findings not only expand our understanding of the association between microbes and diseases but also provide a potential approach for disease diagnosis and forensics.
