{"id":62968,"title":"Longitudinal monitoring with multiple MR techniques in a case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the brain caused by the JC virus in immunocompromised patients. We report characteristic features of proton MR spectroscopy, 3-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging in a 53-year-old patient with PML. The utility of multi-modal magnetic resonance techniques for longitudinal monitoring was indicated by their reevaluation over time and consideration of their relation to prognosis.
