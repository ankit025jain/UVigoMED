{"id":52917,"title":"Benefit from synchronous portal-superior mesenteric vein resection during pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with portal-superior mesenteric vein synchronous resection for cancer remains a hot debate topic. The present study used meta-analytical technique to provide update information and an evidence-based evaluation on both the perioperative benefit and long-term survival.A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate studies comparing venous resection (VR) versus without venous resection (WVR) groups. 22 retrospective studies including 2890 patients were eligible for an analysis of perioperative morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was made according to histopathology and resection margin status respectively for the purpose of survival assessment.There was no difference in perioperative morbidity, mortality and 1-year, 3-year survival between two groups, but showed differences in median tumor size (P < 0.001), R0 resection rate (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.03), pancreatic fistula (P = 0.01), and 5-year survival (P = 0.03). In subgroup analysis, patients in venous resection group received R0 resection had a significantly better survival comparing with who received R1 resection both at 2-year (P < 0.001) and 5-year (P = 0.00002). In histopathology subgroup, patients in venous resection groups who had true tumor infiltration had a significantly bad survival comparing with whom only with inflammation pathology.Pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with venous resection can achieve equal perioperative morbidity and mortality as standard resection. However, in order to obtain an optimal survival outcome, surgeons should make an R0 resection as far as possible, especially in cases need synchronous venous resection.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560302","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.896031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.777552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.660143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Resection margin","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resection_margin"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.37216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.353658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
