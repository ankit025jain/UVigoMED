{"id":68427,"title":"Three-dimensional computed tomography planning improves percutaneous stone surgery.","abstract":"Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) has become the gold standard for treatment of renal stones larger than 2 cm. To optimize the surgical procedure a method for meticulous preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) planning was developed and analysed. The aim of this study was to evaluate how 3D-CT influenced the choice of access route and treatment outcome.Patients planned for PCNL were included in a prospective study. Decision algorithms were studied and recorded before and after 3D-CT planning in a total of 35 patients.Thirty-one of the patients (88%) had a complex stone situation. The CT examinations resulted in change of access plan in 15 out of 28 patients, in addition to seven patients where access could not be planned without 3D-CT, totalling 22 out of 35 (63%). This resulted in 24 patients (69%) being stone free after a single PCNL session. Of these 24 patients, 22 (22/35 = 63%) were stone free with one dilated access track only. In 16 of the 24 patients (76%) who were stone free after one PCNL procedure, evaluation of the 3D-CT images had changed the initial preoperative planning (10 cases) or made planning possible (six cases). A few patients had thoracic complications but there were no cases with bleeding.Preoperative planning of complex stone situations with 3D-CT had a significant impact on operative procedure, resulting in a low number of access punctures.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521181","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.651808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.154165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.144795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0326281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_nephrolithotomy"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"23rd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_century_BC"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Query plan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_plan"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Discrete cosine transform","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"}]}
