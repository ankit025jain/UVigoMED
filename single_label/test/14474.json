{"id":14474,"title":"Serial CT features of pulmonary leptospirosis in 10 dogs.","abstract":"Leptospirosis pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome (LPHS) is a frequent manifestation of Leptospira infection in dogs and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Three helical 16-slice thoracic CT scans were performed in 10 dogs naturally infected with Leptospira, within 24 hours of admission, and three and seven days later. Patients were sedated and scanned without breathhold, with a protocol adapted for rapid scanning. One dog died of respiratory failure on the morning following the first scan. On the initial scan, imaging features of LPHS included ground-glass nodules (10/10), peribronchovascular interstitial thickening (10/10), diffuse or patchy ground-glass opacity (9/10), solid nodules (8/10) and consolidation (7/10). Temporary bronchiolar dilation was observed in all dogs in association with peribronchovascular interstitial thickening, which had completely resolved at day 7. Nodules were with few exceptions assigned to the centrilobular region. Regression of lesion severity was observed after each subsequent scan. Consolidation and solid nodules changed over time into lesions of ground-glass attenuation. Pleural effusion (3/10) and mediastinal effusion (2/10) were mild and transient. Lesion severity appeared unassociated with survival to discharge.
