{"id":44486,"title":"Acid-based parameters on pH-impedance testing predict symptom improvement with medical management better than impedance parameters.","abstract":"pH-impedance testing detects reflux events irrespective of pH, but its value in predicting treatment outcome is unclear. We prospectively evaluated subjects treated medically after pH-impedance testing to determine predictors of symptom improvement.Subjects referred for pH-impedance testing completed questionnaires in which dominant symptoms and global symptom severity (GSS) were recorded. Acid-reflux parameters (acid-exposure time, AET; symptom association by Ghillebert probability estimate, GPE; symptom index, SI) and impedance reflux parameters (reflux-exposure time, RET; number of reflux events; GPE and SI with impedance data) were extracted. Symptoms and GSS were prospectively reevaluated after medical therapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined predictors of GSS improvement following medical management.Over 5 years, 128 subjects (mean 53.3±1.3 years, 66.4% female; typical symptoms 57.0%, 53.9% tested on therapy) underwent pH-impedance testing and subsequent medical therapy for reflux symptoms, and completed required questionnaires. On follow-up 3.35±0.14 years later, mean GSS declined by 45.0%, with 42.2% patients reporting ?50% GSS improvement. On univariate analysis, total AET, AET?4.0%, and GPE for all reflux events predicted both linear and ?50% GSS improvement, but RET and number of reflux events did not. On multivariate analysis, controlling for testing on or off therapy, only AET (P=0.003) and GPE for all reflux events (P=0.029) predicted GSS improvement.Acid-based reflux parameters offer greater value over impedance-based nonacid-reflux parameters in predicting symptomatic responses to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Our findings support conducting pH-impedance studies off PPI therapy to maximize clinical utility in predicting outcome.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732868","annotations":[{"name":"Probability","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.363238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.325673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Clinical utility of diagnostic tests","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_utility_of_diagnostic_tests"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"GPE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPE"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Overtime (sports)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"1996 in comics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_in_comics"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
