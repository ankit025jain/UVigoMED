{"id":85724,"title":"Hypoxaemia in hospitalised under-five Nigerian children with pneumonia.","abstract":"Hypoxaemia constitutes a possible complication of severe respiratory illness which is often under-reported in developing countries. Therefore, the current study was carried out to determine the prevalence and clinical predictors of hypoxaemia in hospitalized under-five children with pneumonia in Ilorin, Nigeria.This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of 200 children aged between two months and five years with pneumonia recruited consecutively. Socio-demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained. The pulse oximetry measurement was recorded after a stable reading for at least one minute while the child was breathing room air. Hypoxaemia was defined as an arterial oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Data was analyzed using the SPSS 20.0 software.The male/female ratio was 1.5:1.The prevalence of hypoxaemia in the children with pneumonia was 41.5%.Using a linear regression analysis, the clinical features that were significantly associated with hypoxaemia were restlessness, lower chest wall indrawing, bronchial breath sounds and tender hepatomegaly (p<0.05 each). Restlessness had a sensitivity of 22.9%, specificity of 91.5%, while chest wall indrawing had a sensitivity of 86.7% and specificity of 53.3%. Bronchial breath sound had a sensitivity of 16.9%, a specificity of 95.7% whereas tender hepatomegaly had a sensitivity of 48.2% and specificity of 82.9%.There is a high local burden of pneumonia-associated hypoxaemia. Restlessness, chest wall indrawing, bronchial breath sounds and tender hepatomegaly could be useful in detecting pneumonia-related hypoxemia in poorly equipped health facilities.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872265","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.837143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.818916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.663118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.629353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Respiratory sounds","weight":0.62031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_sounds"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Hepatomegaly","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatomegaly"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.406998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.326066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.121041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.120837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Psychomotor agitation","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
