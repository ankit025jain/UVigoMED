{"id":46634,"title":"[Drinking water regulations in Ukraine and infectious morbidity rate with water pathway of transmission of causative agents].","abstract":"These are presented drinking water regulations in Ukraine on microbiological indices in the new state document \"Hygienic Drinking water regulations intended for human consumption\" (State sanitary regulations and standards (GsanPiN) 2.2.4-171-10). There is reported an analysis of both the open waterbodies water quality and water for centralized water supply in 2007-2011 and 1992-1996 also on sanitary-bacteriological indices for performance of comparative retrospective analysis. There has been shown water quality degradation for open waterbodies, the main sources of water supply for population. Against this background, a marked improvement of drinking water quality has been noted, the number of non-standard samples decreased to 3.6 % compared with 8.8% in the preceding 15 years. This index correlates with a decrease in the number of outbreaks of infections transmitted by water. There was noted unsatisfactory registration of viral infections with water pathway of transmission and the increase in morbidity rate of gastroenterocolitides of unknown etiology that may include acute viral intestinal infections. Expediency to keep \"fermentation of glucose\" test in bacteriological examination of water in the identification scheme of general coliforms has been substantiated.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624818","annotations":[{"name":"Virus","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Water supply","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ukraine","weight":0.633812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.599758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.594301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.469872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.463545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Water quality","weight":0.454245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.303971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.302434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Body of water","weight":0.193939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.16647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coliform bacteria","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coliform_bacteria"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Economic planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning"}]}
