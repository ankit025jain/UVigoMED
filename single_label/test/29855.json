{"id":29855,"title":"Genome-wide microarray analysis identifies a potential role for striatal retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the pathogenesis of experimental L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.","abstract":"l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the most widely used drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Unfortunately, chronic administration of this dopamine precursor causes L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), which is a debilitating complication whose pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we compared gene expression profiles of sensorimotor striatum tissue derived from LID and non-LID 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats treated with L-DOPA. Total RNA was amplified, transcribed and hybridized to Agilent Whole Rat Genome Oligo Microarray chips. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR was conducted to validate the microarray data. We detected 382 upregulated genes and 115 downregulated genes in LID rats when compared with that of non-LID subjects with Significance Analysis for Microarrays software. The differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with postsynaptic cell membranes, synapses, and neurotransmitter receptors. Gene Set Analysis (GSA) software was used to identify differentially expressed gene ontology (GO) categories and pathways. The GSA found that \"long-term depression\" and \"retrograde endocannabinoid signaling\" pathways were downregulated, whereas a set of lipid metabolism-related GO categories and pathways were upregulated in LID rats compared with non-LID controls. Our study provides further experimental evidence to support the direct correlation between abnormal striatal synaptic plasticity and the induction of LID, and it suggests that the dysfunction of the retrograde endocannabinoid signaling system, a lipid-based neuromodulatory system, and the relevant alteration of the related lipid metabolism processes might play an important role in the pathogenesis of LID.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced
