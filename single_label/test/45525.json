{"id":45525,"title":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) versus simplified/hybrid ESD.","abstract":"The development of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has enabled en bloc resection of lesions regardless of size and shape. However, ESD of colorectal tumors is technically difficult. Early stage colorectal tumors can be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) but larger tumors may require piecemeal resection. Therefore, ESD with snaring has been proposed for more reliable EMR and easier ESD. This is a good option to fill the gap between EMR and ESD, and a good step to the introduction of full ESD.
