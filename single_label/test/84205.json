{"id":84205,"title":"Surgical techniques to prevent delayed gastric emptying after esophagectomy with gastric interposition: a systematic review.","abstract":"Delayed gastric emptying is observed in 10% to 50% of patients after esophagectomy with gastric interposition. The effects of gastric interposition diameter, pyloric drainage, reconstructive route, and anastomotic site on postoperative gastric emptying were systematically reviewed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Most studies showed superior passage of the gastric tube compared with the whole stomach. Pyloric drainage is not significantly associated with the risk of developing delayed gastric emptying after esophagectomy. For reconstructive route and anastomotic site, available evidence on delayed gastric emptying is limited. Prospectively randomized studies with standardized outcome measurements are recommended.
