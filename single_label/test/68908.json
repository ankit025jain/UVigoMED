{"id":68908,"title":"Perineal anastomotic urethroplasty in a pediatric cohort with posterior urethral strictures: critical analysis of outcomes in a contemporary series.","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term outcomes of perineal anastomotic urethroplasty for post-traumatic pediatric posterior urethral strictures.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 65 boys who had a perineal anastomotic urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior urethral strictures between 1991 and 2010. Patients were followed up for a mean (range) of 78 (13-210) months by a history, urinary flow rate estimate, retrograde urethrography, and voiding cystourethrography. Regression analysis was done to assess the predictors of success after urethroplasty.The mean (range) age of the patients was 9.3 (3-16) years. The estimated radiographic stricture length before surgery was 2.4 (1-5) cm. All patients presented with a suprapubic cystostomy tube and scheduled for delayed or repeated correction of a urethral stricture. Twenty boys (30%) had failed previous attempts of repair elsewhere. Mean interval between the original trauma and repair in new cases, and since the last repair in recurrent cases, was 7 months. The perineal anastomotic repair was successful in 58 of 65 (89%) patients. All treatment failures were at the anastomosis and were within the first year. Failed repairs were successfully managed endoscopically in 5 patients and by repeat perineal anastomotic repair in the remaining 2. All boys are continent. There was no chordee or urethral diverticula during the follow-up.One-stage perineal anastomotic repair of post-traumatic urethral strictures in boys is feasible with minimal morbidity. Denovo cases and surgeon experience are the predictors of success after urethroplasty.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485997","annotations":[{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Diverticulum","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulum"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.601444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.494426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.339322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.315796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.281463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.230489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Chordee","weight":0.202124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordee"},{"name":"Suprapubic cystostomy","weight":0.147918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprapubic_cystostomy"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Voiding cystourethrogram","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiding_cystourethrogram"},{"name":"Urine flow rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_flow_rate"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"De novo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Continent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"}]}
