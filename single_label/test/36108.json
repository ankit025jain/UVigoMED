{"id":36108,"title":"[Acute respiratory failures caused by post-tracheotomy tracheomalacia].","abstract":"A 77-year-old man underwent thoracic surgery. He had a history of two previous operations: parapharyngeal tumor removal with temporal tracheotomy 14 years ago and, two years later, a sinus surgery when, according to our anesthesia registry, intubation was extremely difficult due to stricture of the trachea underneath the tracheotomy scar. Pathology was not fully elucidated. Preoperative examinations including chest x-ray, spirogram and CT were not remarkable. The scar above the suprasternal notch was visibly sunken and retracted with respiration. Stridor was auscultated but breathing was not labored. The patient was anesthetized with propofol and intubation was smooth. During surgery anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, remifentanil and rocuronium. However, extubation was followed by desperate gasping and severe respiratory distress. The tracheotomy scar caved in and the airway collapsed. Continuous airway pressure via a facemask restored airway patency and improved breathing. After overnight respiratory support with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), patient was weaned from ventilator. Airway collapse and the two episodes of respiratory failures while under general anesthesia were attributed to post-tracheotomy tracheomalacia.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601110","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Stridor","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridor"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Tracheomalacia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheomalacia"},{"name":"Thoracic surgery","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Auscultation","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auscultation"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Positive pressure ventilation","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_pressure_ventilation"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.748461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.614481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.564935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.476025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Rocuronium bromide","weight":0.473784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocuronium_bromide"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"}]}
