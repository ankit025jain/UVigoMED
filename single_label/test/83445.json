{"id":83445,"title":"Gluteal implant displacement: diagnosis and treatment.","abstract":"First reported in 1969, buttocks implant surgery has evolved greatly since the introduction of the intramuscular technique. This technique provides good implant coverage and protects the sciatic nerve from compression. However, it enables the occurrence of a new complication, intramuscular hernia or implant displacement. The goal of this research study is to describe, classify, and standardize the treatment of gluteal implant displacement.The treatment algorithm was developed after dissection of fresh human cadavers and analysis of computed tomographic scans in patients with implant displacement. After elaborating the treatment protocol for implant displacement, it was prospectively applied in 24 patients that presented with visible implants.Intramuscular dissection has proven to be technically possible when a minimum of 2 cm of muscle thickness is achieved. One-stage surgery was applied in 41 buttocks (21 patients). The control computed tomographic scan obtained 3 months after surgery has shown fibrosis in the buttocks area, corresponding to the subcutaneous capsule housing the implant in the anomalous position. The operative wound complications were more frequent, and treatment failure with relapse of the implant superficial displacement occurred in only one of 47 buttocks (2.1 percent).The treatment of gluteal implant displacement can be a one-stage surgical procedure for most patients. This decision is based on the thickness of the gluteus maximus muscle just below the implant.Therapeutic, IV.","date":"2014-10-31","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25357026","annotations":[{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.814578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.499004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.47764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.367871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.212913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.186132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.10245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.0712245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gluteus maximus muscle","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteus_maximus_muscle"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Gluteal muscles","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteal_muscles"}]}
