{"id":82398,"title":"Resection of early oral squamous cell carcinoma with positive or close margins: relevance of adjuvant treatment in relation to local recurrence: margins of 3 mm as safe as 5 mm.","abstract":"The treatment strategy of early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma's (OSCC) resected with close or involved margins is a returning point of discussion. In this study we reviewed the consequences of re-resection (RR), postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) or watchful waiting (WW).Two-hundred patients with a primary resected Stage 1-2 OSCC of the tongue, floor of the mouth and cheek were included and retrospectively analysed. Local recurrence ratio was related to margin status, unfavourable histological parameters (spidery infiltrative, peri-neural and vascular-invasive growth) and postoperative treatment modality. 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) was calculated in relation to margin status.Twenty-two of 200 (11%) patients had pathological positive margins (PM), 126 (63%) close margins (CM), and 52 (26%) free margins (FM). OS and DSS were not significantly different between these groups. Nine of 200 (4.5%) patients developed local recurrent disease. Two (9.1%) had a PM, five (4.0%) a CM and two (3.8%) a FM. Of the nine recurrences, five patients had undergone PORT, one a RR, and three follow-up. Watchful waiting for CM ?3 mm with ?2 unfavourable histological parameters showed, besides margin status no significant differences with the FM group.With this treatment strategy, the local recurrence rate was 4.5%. No evidence was found for local adjuvant treatment in case of close margins ?3 mm with ?2 unfavourable histological parameters. Current data do not support the use of one treatment modality above any other.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630900","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.437908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.401841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Frequency modulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Orion (spacecraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Perineurium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineurium"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
