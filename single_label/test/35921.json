Diagnosis was based on MRI and the patients were treated by a cystoperitoneal or a cysto-atrial shunt. The surgical procedure was successful in the 3 cases, resulting in the rapid disappearance of symptoms.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613423","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.786258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.775526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.665544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.368512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Extrapyramidal symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptoms"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
