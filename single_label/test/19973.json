{"id":19973,"title":"Immunologic status and virologic outcomes in repeat pregnancies to HIV-positive women not on antiretroviral therapy at conception: a case for lifelong antiretroviral therapy?","abstract":"During their second pregnancy with diagnosed HIV (n = 1177), two-fifths of women in the UK/Ireland not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at conception had an immunological indication for treatment (CD4(+) <350 cells/?l), of whom nearly half had CD4(+) at least 350 cells/?l in their previous pregnancy. Those initiating ART during pregnancy had a 4.3-fold increased odds of detectable viral load at delivery compared with those conceiving on treatment, suggesting that continuation of ART after pregnancy may be beneficial for many women.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685820","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.658821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.217426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"1177","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1177"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Continuation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation"}]}
