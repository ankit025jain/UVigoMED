{"id":71213,"title":"Accumulation of cytolytic CD8+ T cells in B16-melanoma and proliferation of mature T cells in TIS21-knockout mice after T cell receptor stimulation.","abstract":"In vivo and in vitro effects of TIS21 gene on the mature T cell activation and antitumor activities were explored by employing MO5 melanoma orthograft and splenocytes isolated from the TIS21-knockout (KO)(2) mice. Proliferation and survival of mature T cells were significantly increased in the KO than the wild type (WT3)e cells, indicating that TIS21 inhibits the rate of mature T cell proliferation and its survival. In MO5 melanoma orthograft model, the KO mice recruited much more CD8(+) T cells into the tumors at around day 14 after tumor cell injection along with reduced tumor volumes compared with the WT. The increased frequency of granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells in splenocytes of the KO mice compared with the WT may account for antitumor-immunity of TIS21 gene in the melanoma orthograft. In contrast, reduced frequencies of CD107a+ CD8+ T cells in the splenocytes of KO mice may affect the loss of CD8+ T cell infiltration in the orthograft at around day 19. These results indicate that TIS21 exhibits antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in mature T cells, and differentially affects the frequencies of granzyme B+ CD8+ T-cells and CD107a+ CD8+ T-cells, thus transiently regulating in vivo anti-tumor immunity.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25088256","annotations":[{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.81888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytolysis","weight":0.694493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.613516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.583475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"GZMB","weight":0.330978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GZMB"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Granzyme","weight":0.276208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granzyme"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
