{"id":66418,"title":"A Phase I/Ib study of folate immune (EC90 vaccine administered with GPI-0100 adjuvant followed by EC17) with interferon-? and interleukin-2 in patients with renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Folate immune (EC90 vaccine with GPI-0100 adjuvant followed by EC17) is a novel folate-targeted hapten immunotherapy designed to exploit the overexpression of folate receptors on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. In this open-label, phase I/II clinical study, we report the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of folate immune with concurrent interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-? (IFN-?) in patients with recurrent or metastatic RCC. Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Following 2 phase I cohorts of 6 patients each, we extended the study to 12 additional patients: 18 received weekly vaccination of 1.2 mg of EC90 with 3.0 mg of GPI-0100 adjuvant for 4 weeks. Beginning on cycle 1, day 8, 0.3 mg/kg of EC17 was administered once daily, 5 days per week (Monday-Friday) for 4 consecutive weeks. Beginning on cycle 1, day 15, IL-2 and IFN-? were administered at doses of 12 and 3.0 MIU, respectively, after the EC17 dose, 3 times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 3 weeks. In cycle 2, IL-2 and IFN-?, doses of 7.0 and 3.0 MIU, respectively, were administered 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 4 consecutive weeks. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Most adverse events reported were grade 1 or 2, with only twelve grade ?3 toxicities reported. Sixteen patients had progressive disease, 7 patients were observed to have stable disease, and 1 patient achieved a partial response lasting 71 days. Overall, folate immune plus low-dose IFN-? and IL-2 was safe and well tolerated with some observed clinical activity.
