{"id":76274,"title":"Study to assess whether waist circumference and changes in serum glucose and lipid profile are independent variables for the CETP gene.","abstract":"To observe the relationship among genes, obesity and the changes in serum glucose and lipid profile to assess whether obesity-related disease results from genes and/or obesity.Correlations among serum glucose, lipids, waist circumference (WC), and Taq1B, I405V, and D442G polymorphisms of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was used to screen independent variables among obesity-related anthropometric indexes and serum biochemical indicators for genes.The waist circumference density index (WCDI) may be attributed to changes in serum biochemical indicators and among WCDI, BMI and serum biochemical indicators, however, only WCDI was an independent variable for the G allele. Differences were observed in anthropometric indexes and serum biochemical indicators between subjects with the G allele and those without (p<0.05).Abdominal obesity and changes in serum glucose and lipid profile are affected by a group of genes, including CETP. Correlation of the CETP gene with waist circumference may be independent compared with serum glucose and lipid profile.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115339","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.859295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.800245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.756063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cholesterylester transfer protein","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterylester_transfer_protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.589497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.478027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.41775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.240292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.20493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Cholesteryl ester","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteryl_ester"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.105555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"}]}
