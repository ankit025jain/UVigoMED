{"id":91762,"title":"Second-look arthroscopy after surgical treatment of Schatzker type II plateau fractures through the lateral submeniscal approach.","abstract":"To evaluate cartilage healing using second-look arthroscopic examination in tibia plateau fracture patients who have undergone open reduction and internal fixation with a submeniscal approach technique.Between January 2007 and January 2010, we used second-look arthroscopy during 18-24-month follow-up of 20 patients with Schatzkar type II tibial plateau fractures who had undergone open reduction and internal fixation with a submeniscal approach technique. We classified patients according to step-off, knee range of motion, and Knee Society Score, and compared the results with those obtained by arthroscopy.Radiologically, 16 cases (80 %) were reduced within 2 mm of step-off. In 11 of these cases, according to the Outerbridge classification, we checked for chondromalacia from grade II to III. We observed 2 mm of step-off in four cases, and each had chondromalacia of at least grade III. The Knee Society Score was associated with chondromalacia grade (p < 0.05).Even in patients with normal joint range of motion and good clinical and radiological results, the actual condition of the articular cartilage varied significantly. Therefore, more long-term and regular follow-up is needed for proximal plateau fractures.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477291","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.877761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.727416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.704294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.668994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.421392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Chondromalacia patellae","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondromalacia_patellae"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"},{"name":"1824","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
