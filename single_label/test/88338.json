{"id":88338,"title":"[Invasive emergency techniques--decompression of the pleura].","abstract":"On-scene invasive emergency procedures, such as cricothyroidotomy, chest drain, intraosseous puncture or even on-field-amputation, are often unavoidable, when indicated, and present a major challenge for the emergency physician. Personal, temporal or local conditions are often unsuitable. Even with regular intervention by the emergency medical service, \"last resort\" measures occur very infrequently, particularly in relation to paediatric emergencies. Beside a theoretical education, practice-oriented course concepts are necessary to achieve a high quality of these measures. This article presents the use of decompression of the pleura on adults and children, with reference to indication, implementation, problems and risks. It is the second part of a series of four articles on the subject of invasive emergency techniques.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863329","annotations":[{"name":"Emergency physician","weight":0.846119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_physician"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Cricothyrotomy","weight":0.744858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricothyrotomy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Intraosseous infusion","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraosseous_infusion"},{"name":"Chest tube","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_tube"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Resort","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Annus Mirabilis papers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
