{"id":13387,"title":"Time-dependent changes and association between liver free fatty acids, serum lipid profile and histological features in mice model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","abstract":"Methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet duration necessary for development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the dynamic of lipid profile and fatty acids are not completely established. The study examined dynamics and association between liver free fatty acids (FFA), serum lipid profile and liver morphological changes on MCD diet-induced NAFLD in mice.Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 28) were divided into four groups (n = 7 per group): control: fed with standard chow, MCD diet-fed groups: 2, 4 or 6 weeks. After treatment, liver and blood samples were taken for histopathology, serum lipid profile, and liver FFA composition.Hepatic FFA profile showed a decrease in saturated acids, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid, whereas proportions of docosapentaenoic, oleic and linoleic acid were increased. Total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides progressively decreased, whereas LDL level progressively increased. Focal fatty change in the liver appeared after 2 weeks, whereas diffuse fatty change with severe inflammation and ballooned hepatocytes were evident after 6 weeks.Six-week diet model may be appropriate for investigation of the role of lipotoxicity in the progression of NAFLD. Therefore, supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated acid like DHA, rather than DPA, especially in the initial stage of fatty liver disease, may potentially have preventive effects and alleviate development of NAFLD/NASH and may also potentially reduce cardiovascular risk by moderating dyslipidemia.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Animal
