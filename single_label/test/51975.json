{"id":51975,"title":"Lack of correlations among histopathological parameters, Ki-67 proliferation index and prognosis in pheochromocytoma patients.","abstract":"In this study prognostic correlations of histopathologic parameters and the Ki-67 proliferation index and as well as the diagnostic value of immunohistochemical markers in pheochromocytomas were evaluated.A total of 22 patients diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma between 2000-2010 in Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital were included. Diagnostic value of the PASS scoring system, and prognostic correlations of histopathologic parameters and Ki-67 proliferation index were investigated. SPSS for Windows 17.0 software was used for statistical analysis.There was no statistically significant correlation between recurrence and clinicopathologic parameters or the PASS score (PASS>4). In addition, there were no statistically significant correlations between PASS score and clinicopathologic parameters, such as diameter (5 cm), weight (>100g), gender (female/male ratio) and age (25-45/45-55/>55). Besides, there were no significant correlation between diameter and clinicopathological parameters and also recurrence. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between Ki-67 proliferation index and capsule invasion (p=0.047).Some but not most of the findings in our study were concordant with the literature. To clarify relationships, investigations with standard scoring systems which are not affected by subjective factors and feature appropriate histopathological criteria should be made on larger study groups.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641403","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.623701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.122266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.0727563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Subject (philosophy)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Izmir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izmir"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Recursion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Medical algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm"},{"name":"PASS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PASS"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Uncial 047","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_047"},{"name":"Ataturk","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataturk"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"}]}
