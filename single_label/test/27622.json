{"id":27622,"title":"[Study on PK-PD characteristics of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1, in rats with myocardial ischemia following intravenous administration of shengmai injection].","abstract":"It is the objective of this paper to study pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) characteristics of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 on the effect of inducing nitric oxide (NO) release after intravenous administration of Shengmai injection to rats with myocardial ischemia. The model of myocardial ischemia rats was produced by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol. The serum samples were collected at different time points after intravenous administration of Shengmai injection to rats with the dose of 10.8 mL x kg(-1). The concentrations of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 in serum were determined, and then the concentration-time curves were drawn. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 were calculated after the construction of pharmacokinetic models. Meanwhile, NO2- and NO3-, the metabolites of NO, in serum were determined, and then the effect-time curve was drawn. The combined PK-PD model was established based on the theory of effect compartment by Sheiner et al. Then pharmacodynamic parameters were calculated. The results indicated that the pharmacokinetics of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 conformed to a two-compartment model. Ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 exhibited quick and slow elimination in rats respectively. The effect of Shengmai injection on inducing NO release did not relate directly with and lagged behind the concentrations of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 in serum. The effect exhibited good correlation with ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 levels in effect compartment. The relationship between effect and serum concentration fits Sigmoid-E(max) model. This study successfully established the combined PK-PD model of ginsenoside Rg1 and Rb1 after intravenous administration of Shengmai injection to rats. The model can efficiently predict the concentration and effect of Shengmai injection in vivo.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011272","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.867573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.66417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.533174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.330692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Isoprenaline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprenaline"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
