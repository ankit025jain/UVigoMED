{"id":56694,"title":"Intravitreal ranibizumab for retinal vein occlusion through 1 year in clinical practice.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab for branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in daily clinical practice.A prospective study enrolling all patients diagnosed with BRVO or CRVO who received intravitreal ranibizumab therapy at our department.Fifty-seven patients had BRVO and 49 had CRVO. By 12 months, the patients with BRVO improved a mean of 11.6 (P < 0.0001) ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) letters, whereas the patients with CRVO improved a mean of 1.8 letters (P = 0.50). The proportion of patients gaining ? 15 ETDRS letters was 26.3% for BRVO and 16.7% for CRVO. The proportion of patients losing ? 15 ETDRS letters was 0% for BRVO and 8.3% for CRVO. The reduction in foveal center point thickness at 12 months was 248 ?m for BRVO (P < 0.0001) and 222 ?m for CRVO (P < 0.0001). Functional outcome did not mirror anatomical outcome, and younger patients had better outcome.Our 12-month results of BRVO treated with intravitreal ranibizumab in daily clinical practice are similar to the results of the BRAVO trial that led to the approval of the therapy. However, our results for CRVO failed to reproduce the results of the CRUISE trial.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646663","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.5799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.108378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mirror","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
