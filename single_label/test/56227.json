{"id":56227,"title":"Comparison of interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase expression in the subretinal fluid and the vitreous during proliferative vitreoretinopathy: correlations with extent, duration of RRD and PVR grade.","abstract":"The full extent of IL-6 involvement in PVR pathophysiology has not yet been comprehensively investigated. The aim of this study was the comparison of the IL-6 effect on MMP expression between SRF and the vitreous in the context of RRD complicated by PVR.Thirty-one SRF samples from 31 eyes of 31 consecutive patients suffering from RRD with PVR were collected during treatment by scleral buckling. Twenty-eight vitreous samples from 28 eyes of 28 RRD patients with PVR were collected during surgical management with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay was employed for the measurement of MMP-1, -3, -8 and TIMP-1 concentrations (in ng/ml). MMP gelatinolytic activity was determined with the use of gelatin zymography analysis using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).Correlation analysis in the SRF revealed a significant correlation between MMP-1/IL6 and RRD duration. Regression analysis in the SRF revealed a significant correlation between the MMP-9/IL-6 and RRD extent. In the same fluid, with respect to PVR grade, ANOVA revealed a significant relationship with the proMMP-2/IL-6, MMP-2/IL6 and TIMP-1/IL-6 ratios. Graphical representation of the results revealed that, between the SRF and vitreous groups, significant peak values were observed for all MMP/IL-6 and TIMP-1/IL-6 ratios included in this study with the exception of the MMP-2/IL-6 ratio.It appears that there is a significant correlation between the presence of IL-6 and MMP/TIMP ratio in the SRF, indicating that IL-6 may contribute to the increased MMP/TIMP ratio during PVR.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Eye
