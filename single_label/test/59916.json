{"id":59916,"title":"Interferon ?-2b gains high sustained response therapy for advanced essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera with JAK2V617F positive mutation.","abstract":"This open-label, prospective, observational study aimed to evaluate treatment response, efficacy therapy and safety to IFN ?-2b for the essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) with JAK2V617F positive mutation.A total of 123 ET patients received IFN?-2b therapy with JAK2V617F positive or negative mutation; and 136 PV patients with JAK2V617F(+) received IFN?-2b or hydroxyurea (HU) therapy according to random number assignment (ages 18-65 years old).ET patients receiving IFN ?-2b with JAK2V617F(+) had a greater advantage in overall hematologic response (OHR) than JAK2V617F(-) (83.3% versus 61.4%, P<0.01). For PV patients with JAK2V617F(+), IFN had no OHR superiority to HU (70.3% versus 70.8%, P>0.05), but which gained a greater satisfactory molecular response than HU (54.7% versus 19.4%, P<0.01). IFN significantly decreased the phlebotomy rate, which was better than HU for MPDs patients with OHR than HU (3.6% versus 65.7%, P<0.01). Furthermore, ET patients with JAK2V617F(+) demonstrated a definite advantage over JAK2V617F(-) in five-year PFS (75.9% versus 47.6%, P<0.05). For PV patients with JAK2V617F(+), IFN ?-2b was superior to HU in five-year PFS (66.3% versus 46.7%, P<0.01). Moreover, IFN ?-2b also contributed to improved vasomotor symptoms in MPDs, and especially significantly decreased the incidence of distal paresthesias (14.1% versus 37.5%) and erythromelalgia (9.4% versus 29.2%) better than HU (P<0.01). Meanwhile, IFN did not observe the severe hematological adverse events in patients with PV or ET.The data confirmed that IFN ?-2b benefited the patients with ET or PV, particularly for JAK2V617F(+) mutation.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069759","annotations":[{"name":"Hydroxycarbamide","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxycarbamide"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Essential thrombocytosis","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Polycythemia vera","weight":0.728682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia_vera"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Polycythemia","weight":0.650484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.619471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.4941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Erythromelalgia","weight":0.353049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythromelalgia"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.351701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.296392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Janus kinase 2","weight":0.214232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_2"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0444368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_for_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina"},{"name":"Phlebotomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotomy"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"1865","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1865"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"Hot flash","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_flash"},{"name":"Vasomotor","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasomotor"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Ironman 70.3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
