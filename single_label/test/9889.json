{"id":9889,"title":"Development of a chimeric strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus with an infectious clone and a Korean dominant field strain.","abstract":"The K418 chimeric virus of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was engineered by replacing the genomic region containing structure protein genes of an infectious clone of PRRSV, FL12, with the same region obtained from a Korean dominant field strain, LMY. The K418 reached 10(6) TCID50/ml of viral titer with similar growth kinetics to those of parental strains and had a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response to field serum from the entire country. The chimeric clone pK418 can be used as a practical tool for further studying the molecular characteristics of PRRSV proteins through genetic manipulation. Furthermore, successful construction of the K418 will allow for the development of customized vaccine candidates against PRRSV, which has evolved rapidly in Korea.
