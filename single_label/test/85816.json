{"id":85816,"title":"Oncogenic drivers, targeted therapies, and acquired resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer.","abstract":"In the past decade, a shift toward targeted therapies in non-small-cell lung cancer following molecular profiling has dramatically changed the way advanced adenocarcinoma is treated. However, tumor cells inevitably acquire resistance to such therapies, circumventing any sustained clinical benefit. As the genomic classification of lung cancer continues to evolve and as the mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies become elucidated and more improved target-specific drugs come into sight, the future will see more promising results from the clinic through the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome, or prevent the development of, resistance for lung cancer patients.
