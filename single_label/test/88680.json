{"id":88680,"title":"Strategic approach to O'Driscoll type 2 anteromedial coronoid facet fracture.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to suggest a strategic approach to the management of anteromedial coronoid facet (AMCF) fracture that is related to posteromedial rotational instability of the elbow through investigation of the surgical outcome of diverse combinations, including internal fixation of AMCF fractures and repair of collateral ligament injury.The study enrolled 18 patients. On the basis of the size of the coronoid fracture and the degree of the soft tissue injuries that were evaluated with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and varus stress test under anesthesia, these fractures were managed differently. Functional outcomes were evaluated with the visual analog scale score, modified Mayo Elbow Performance Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. Plain radiographs were used to evaluate the degree of arthrosis.There were 2 cases of O'Driscoll type 2, subtype 1 fractures; 14 cases of type 2, subtype 2 fractures; and 2 cases of type 2, subtype 3 fractures. Seven cases were managed with only AMCF fracture fixation, 4 cases with only lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL) repair, 6 cases with concomitant repair of the LUCL and AMCF fracture, and 1 case with a conservative method. There were no significant differences among O'Driscoll types and among the subgroups of type 2-2 (P > .05). When the elbow showed instability on the varus stress test after AMCF fracture fixation, the soft tissue injuries of the lateral elbow were more severe (P =. 015). Arthrosis was not correlated with the patient's symptoms (P > .05).AMCF fracture can be treated by only AMCF fracture fixation, only LUCL repair, or a combination of these techniques, depending on the size of the AMCF fracture fragment and the degree of the lateral soft tissue injuries.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810081","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.692794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.556427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.540748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.501848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.445239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.442143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.243798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.146731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Cardiac stress test","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_stress_test"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Soft tissue injury","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue_injury"},{"name":"Zygapophysial joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygapophysial_joint"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
