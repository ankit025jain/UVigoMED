{"id":68684,"title":"p27KIP1 is involved in ERK1/2-mediated MMP-9 expression via the activation of NF-?B binding in the IL-7-induced migration and invasion of 5637 cells.","abstract":"Interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a pivotal role in the development and survival of lymphocytes, but its role in cancer cell responses remains unexplained. In this study, IL-7 treatment resulted in a significant induction in the wound-healing migration and Matrigel invasion of the 5637 bladder cancer cells, but it did not result in cell proliferation. In addition, IL-7 treatment strongly induced MMP-9 expression, and increased the binding activation of NF-?B and AP-1 motifs, the important transcription factors that regulate MMP-9 expression. Moreover, the treatment of 5637 cells with IL-7 stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. U0126, an ERK1/2-specific inhibitor, blocked IL-7-induced cell migration and invasion, and also suppressed the expression of MMP-9 in the presence of IL-7. Inhibition of the ERK1/2 function consistently reversed the binding activity of NF-?B without altering AP-1 activation in IL-7-stimulated cells. Among the cell cycle regulators examined, only the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1 was induced by IL-7. Moreover, the inhibition of p27KIP1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the migration, invasion and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, the expression of MMP-9, and the binding activity of the NF-?B motif in IL-7-stimulated 5637 cells. These results demonstrated that the cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1 is involved in ERK1/2-mediated MMP-9 expression via activation of the NF-?B binding motif, which leads to the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells induced by IL-7. These novel results could help explain the migration and invasion of bladder tumor cells.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504262","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.784336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.771091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.64443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.627014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.323346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"CDKN1B","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN1B"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Structural motif","weight":0.123606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"AP-1 transcription factor","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP-1_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
