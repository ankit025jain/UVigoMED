{"id":55362,"title":"Retinal structural changes in a case of spontaneous resolution of vitreomacular traction syndrome: multimodal retinal imaging approach.","abstract":"Retinal structural changes in a case of spontaneous resolution of vitreomacular traction (VMT) syndrome were followed by means of multimodal retinal imaging approach.Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) including digital infrared and blue reflectance (BR) imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were performed in a young man with VMT syndrome.At the time of diagnosis, multimodal retinal imaging documented outer retina abnormalities linked to VMT. At 1 month follow-up visit, improvement of best-corrected visual acuity and resolution of metamorphopsia were accompanied by documentation of VMT resolution and outer retina restoration.Both cSLO and SD-OCT imaging, particularly BR and en face OCT adapted to the outer plexiform layer contour, allowed to depict outer retina changes in the course of VMT resolution. A strict correlation between topographic BR images and en face OCT scans was evident.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905253","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.731015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.664861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.651453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.472859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.36893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.358141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.326889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Reflectivity","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectivity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.274844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Outer plexiform layer","weight":0.112303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_plexiform_layer"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_laser_ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Transverse mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_mode"}]}
