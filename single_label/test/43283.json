{"id":43283,"title":"The risk for hepatitis C infection in blood donors in Cluj County, Romania.","abstract":"Blood products safety is based on different criteria including the selection of blood donors. Blood donors referred to Cluj County (Romania) Blood Transfusion Centre in January-March 2012 completed a self-administered questionnaire and were examined by a physician. Data collected from first-time and repeat donors were compared for possible risk factors for hepatitis C infection. In total, 1100 donors were selected. In first-time donors, most frequent factors were age<26 years, female gender and history of health care procedures. Behavioural risk factors (e.g. drug use, sexual promiscuity) may not be properly filtered out in blood donors, suggesting the necessity of improving the health screening process.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797791","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.75757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.635664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Promiscuity","weight":0.520641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuity"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.412504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Blood product","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_product"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.288573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.198354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"}]}
