{"id":53879,"title":"[Effect of human umbilici mesenchymal stromal cells implantation on the BDNF expression in diabetic foot rats].","abstract":"OBJECTITVE: To investigate the effect of human umbilici mesenchymal cells (HUMSCs) implantation on the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in diabetic foot rats.SD rats were divided into three groups (n = 12): normal group, diadetic foot model group and HUMSC treatment group. Diabetic foot model in rats was established, then prepared HUMSC were implanted on the diabetic foot ulcers in rats, and control ones were administrated with saline only. The area of ulceration, sensory function, BDNF expression and its localization were determined by using morphology, physiological function measurement, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assay.Siglificantly decreased area of ulceration in diabetic foot rats of HUMSC implantation group was observed. This was simultaneously companied with the sensory function improvement (P < 0.05). RT-PCR showed that BDNF mRNA expression was significantly up regulated (P < 0.05). BDNF immunstaining was located in epithelia tissue and the protein level of BDNF was markedly increased (P < 0.05).HUMSC implantation maybe an effective strategy on the treatment of ulceration in diabetic foot rats, and the possible mechanism may involve in BDNF expression.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490505","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.658307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.609633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.535087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor","weight":0.42307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor"},{"name":"Neurotrophin","weight":0.41468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.332107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.271502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0187256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
