{"id":55805,"title":"Retinal and choroidal thickness changes after single anti-VEGF injection in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: ranibizumab vs bevacizumab.","abstract":"To evaluate and compare the effects of single intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and bevacizumab on central retinal and choroidal thickness in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Forty eyes of 40 patients with neovascular AMD that underwent intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGFs) were included. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 20 eyes received ranibizumab and 20 eyes received bevacizumab injection. Central retinal and choroidal thicknesses of all eyes at baseline and 1 month postinjection scans were measured with Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the data.The mean central retinal thickness (CRT) showed significant decrease after single injection of ranibizumab (from 345.0 µm to 253.5 µm, p&lt;0.01) and bevacizumab (from 329.5 µm to 251.0 µm, p&lt;0.01) at the first month, respectively. There was no significant difference regarding the CRT change between groups (p = 0.39). The mean choroidal thickness decreased from 158.6 µm (115-317) to 155.5 µm (111-322) in the ranibizumab group and from 211.5 µm (143-284) to 201.5 µm (93-338) in bevacizumab group. The decrease was not significant between groups (p = 0.35).Intravitreal injection of both ranibizumab and bevacizumab provided a significant decrease in CRT; however, the agents caused no significant change in choroidal thickness. Additionally, no difference between ranibizumab versus bevacizumab was observed related to macular edema inhibition.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803153","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.699598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.559022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.329465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.3191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.241807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.174966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.102778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"345","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/345"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Malagasy language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malagasy_language"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
