{"id":81972,"title":"The correlation between the expression of differentiated embryo-chondrocyte expressed gene l and oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"This study aims to explore the correlation between expression of differentiated embryo-chondrocyte expressed gene l (DEC1) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which could provide the reference for treatment and prognosis assessment of OSCC.The expression of DEC1 in tissues from 56 primary OSCC patients and 20 normal oral mucosa samples were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical methods, respectively.The results showed that the positive expression rate of DEC1 in the OSCC group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (P <0.05); further, the expression of DEC1 in different OSCC groups was statistically significant (P <0.05). The expression of DEC1 in the 1-year recurrence OSCC group was significantly higher than other groups. The expression of DEC1 in the 3-years no recurrence OSCC group was the lowest.The expression of DEC1 was associated with the incidence of OSCC and there was a negative correlation between the expression of DEC1 and the prognosis of OSCC.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758579","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.591886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.486457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.296396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Digital Equipment Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"}]}
