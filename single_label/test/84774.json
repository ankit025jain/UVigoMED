{"id":84774,"title":"Factors influencing readiness to deploy in disaster response: findings from a cross-sectional survey of the Department of Veterans Affairs Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel System.","abstract":"The Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel System (DEMPS) program provides a system of volunteers whereby active or retired Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) personnel can register to be deployed to support other VA facilities or the nation during national emergencies or disasters. Both early and ongoing volunteer training is required to participate.This study aims to identify factors that impact willingness to deploy in the event of an emergency. This analysis was based on responses from 2,385 survey respondents (response rate, 29%). Latent variable path models were developed and tested using the EQS structural equations modeling program. Background demographic variables of education, age, minority ethnicity, and female gender were used as predictors of intervening latent variables of DEMPS Volunteer Experience, Positive Attitude about Training, and Stress. The model had acceptable fit statistics, and all three intermediate latent variables significantly predicted the outcome latent variable Readiness to Deploy.DEMPS Volunteer Experience and a Positive Attitude about Training were associated with Readiness to Deploy. Stress was associated with decreased Readiness to Deploy. Female gender was negatively correlated with Readiness to Deploy; however, there was an indirect relationship between female gender and Readiness to Deploy through Positive Attitude about Training.These findings suggest that volunteer emergency management response programs such as DEMPS should consider how best to address the factors that may make women less ready to deploy than men in order to ensure adequate gender representation among emergency responders. The findings underscore the importance of training opportunities to ensure that gender-sensitive support is a strong component of emergency response, and may apply to other emergency response programs such as the Medical Reserve Corps and the American Red Cross.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038628","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.663236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement","weight":0.659731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement"},{"name":"State of emergency","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.64282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.637615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.630975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.581271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.56631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Nation","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.522886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.440196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Emergency service","weight":0.437115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.431007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.380424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.260156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"American Red Cross","weight":0.206412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Experience","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Voter registration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration"},{"name":"Structural equation modeling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling"},{"name":"Representation (politics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(politics)"}]}
