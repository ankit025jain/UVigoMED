{"id":24494,"title":"Reconstructing the infected aortic root with antibiotic impregnated biological glue.","abstract":"Prosthetic valve dehiscence and persistent infection are two complications following reconstruction of the aortic root in destructive endocarditis. A technique is described involving the principles of aggressive debridement, closure of large abscess cavities with biological material incorporating a slurry of antibiotic-impregnated biological sealant, and replacement of the aortic valve with an aortic allograft valve. This strategy appears to have been successful in preventing persistent endocarditis and valve dehiscence in a limited number of patients.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433228","annotations":[{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.948144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.726513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.717669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.651334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.494868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.432155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Biomaterial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"},{"name":"Slurry","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry"},{"name":"Sealant","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealant"}]}
