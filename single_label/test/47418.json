{"id":47418,"title":"Embolization of the hemorrhoidal arteries (the emborrhoid technique): a new concept and challenge for interventional radiology.","abstract":"Elective transanal Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DG-HAL) has recently been shown to be effective in hemorrhoidal disease. It consists of ligating the terminal branches of the superior rectal artery under Doppler guidance, in order to reduce the hemorrhoidal arterial blood flow and improve the symptoms. By analogy, we propose performing this arterial occlusion using the \"emborrhoid\" technique (embolization of the hemorrhoidal arteries), in which arterial occlusion is achieved via the endovascular route using coils placed in the terminal branches of the superior rectal arteries. Three patients have been treated by this new technique, and the observations show that it is feasible and reproducible, with no ischemic complications or pain. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this technique for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease.
