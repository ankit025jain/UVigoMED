{"id":77492,"title":"Cervical spondylosis in South West Nigerian farmers and female traders.","abstract":"Neck pain is a common pain syndrome in the clinical practice. It may or may not be associated with the radiculopathy or myelopathy. Load carrying on the head is believed to be associated with an increased incidence of cervical spondylosis. Radiographic spondylosis is noticeable in 25-50% of people of 50 years of age and in 75-90% by the age of 65 years.Plain cervical radiograph were obtained in all farmers and female traders above 45 years of age who complained of neck pain. Those who met the radiological diagnostic criteria were enlisted in the study. The study was carried out over a 3 year period (July 2009-June 2012) in a private rheumatology clinic.Thirty six cases of cervical spondylosis were seen, representing 10.7% of a total rheumatology cases seen over the study period. There were 23 males (63.9%) and 13 females (36.1%), giving a male : female ratio of 1.8:1. There were 18 male farmers, 5 female farmers, and 5 female traders. Eight males and 6 females showed severe degenerative changes in the cervical spine. Mostly affected were C4-C7 cervical spine levels.Load carrying, as earlier documented in literature may be a significant contributory factor to the degenerative process of the cervical spine.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705109","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.794467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.582455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.249696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Myelopathy","weight":0.195727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelopathy"},{"name":"Radiculopathy","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiculopathy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Spondylosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylosis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Channel 4","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4"},{"name":"Load (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(album)"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Coccyx","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccyx"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Enlisted rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Neck pain","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
