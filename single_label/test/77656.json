{"id":77656,"title":"Seroprevalence of hepatitis E antibodies in a population of recyclable waste pickers in Brazil.","abstract":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection represents an important cause of acute viral hepatitis. Selective waste collection is a widespread activity carried out by the urban poor, and recyclable waste pickers have a lifestyle that makes this group highly vulnerable to unfavorable socio-economic and environmental factors. To date, the epidemiology of HEV infection in this population remains unknown.To assess the seroprevalence of hepatitis E-specific antibodies in a population of recyclable waste pickers in Brazil.Between April 2010 and May 2011, a cross-sectional study was conducted among recyclable waste pickers from all 15 recycling cooperatives in GoiÃ¢nia City, Central Brazil. The participants were tested for serological markers indicative of HEV infection.Of 432 individuals asked to participate in the survey, 431 (99.8%) agreed to participate. Twenty-four of 431 participants were anti-HEV IgG positive by ELISA. Of these, 22 were confirmed positive by immunoblot, resulting in an anti-HEV IgG prevalence of 5.1% (95% CI: 3.4-7.6). In addition, four individuals were anti-HEV IgM positive by ELISA. Of these, three (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.4-2.4) were confirmed anti-HEV IgM positive by immunoblot, but were HEV RNA negative. One was concurrently positive for anti-HEV IgG. Only age>40 years was independently associated with the presence of anti-HEV.These findings demonstrated that the prevalence of HEV antibodies among recyclable waste pickers in Central Brazil is relatively low and increased with age.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480723","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Hepatitis E","weight":0.831221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.761063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.619996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.435634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Recycling","weight":0.24461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Hepatitis E virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E_virus"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"431","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/431"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Hybrid vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Sewage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Continental knitting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_knitting"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
