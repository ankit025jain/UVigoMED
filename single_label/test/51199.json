{"id":51199,"title":"[Heart failure. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"In spite of new therapy options the life expectancy of patients with diabetes mellitus is clearly reduced compared to the average population. In addition to coronary heart disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy, cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is also a factor in patients with diabetes mellitus. The CAN is an impairment of cardiovascular control. A reduced variability of heart rate up to the point of a fixed heart rate are symptoms of CAN. In addition symptomatic hypotension, a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death are also signs of CAN. Prevalence rates of CAN increase with age and are approximately 38?% in patients 40-70 years old with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 44?% in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. The disease is usually documented using miscellaneous cardiovascular autonomic tests so that therapy can be started as soon as possible.
