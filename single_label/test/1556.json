{"id":1556,"title":"Designer drugs. Patients may be using synthetic cannabinoids more than you think.","abstract":"Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a large family of man-made chemical compounds functionally or biologically similar to natural cannabinoids. They produce marijuana-like effects from binding to cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) and have sometimes been referred to as \"fake pot,\" \"legal weed,\" \"new marijuana\" and \"legal high.\" These substances are marketed to teens and young adults and have become the second most-abused illicit substance in the United States after marijuana. They appeal to young people because they're relatively inexpensive, easily available and aren't detectable on routine drug screens. There's also a major misconception that these drugs are natural, legal, safe and produce less adverse effects than marijuana.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322519","annotations":[{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.646624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.614623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.605767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Designer drug","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_drug"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.253289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Weed","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weed"},{"name":"Synthetic cannabis","weight":0.0722222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_cannabis"},{"name":"Cannabinoid receptor","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Appeal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Misconceptions about HIV and AIDS","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misconceptions_about_HIV_and_AIDS"}]}
