{"id":72960,"title":"Cardiovascular events among 1090 cancer patients treated with sunitinib, interferon, or placebo: a comprehensive adjudicated database analysis demonstrating clinically meaningful reversibility of cardiac events.","abstract":"To define cardiovascular (CV) risk and reversibility of cardiac events in patients who received sunitinib versus comparator treatment (interferon-alfa or placebo).We performed a retrospective adjudication of comprehensive CV adverse events (AEs) from two phase 3 trials. Components of the comprehensive CV AE end-point comprised hypertension, symptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction decreases (SD-LVEF; AD-LVEF) and extent of reversibility, heart-failure symptoms, thromboembolic events, dysrhythmia and CV death. Three cardiologists and one oncologist, blinded to treatment allocation, adjudicated suspected CV AEs in the pooled trial database (N=1090).Incidence rates (IR) for sunitinib versus Interferon-alfa (IFN-?)/placebo were hypertension: 6.9 versus 2.6 (hazard ratio (HR), 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4-4.0); SD-LVEF: 0.4 versus 0.2 (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-6.2); AD-LVEF: 1.1 versus 0.8 (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4); and composite CV AE end-point: 10.1 versus 4.8 (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.0-3.1), however reversibility, not previously quantified, was found to be clinically meaningful.Hypertension and SD-LVEF/AD-LVEF were significantly higher with sunitinib versus IFN-?/placebo. Among patients who experienced a cardiac event, symptomatic and asymptomatic instances of decreased cardiac dysfunction were adjudicated as reversible in 47 of 83 (56%) and 17 of 30 (57%), respectively. Among sunitinib-treated patients, many were able to resume sunitinib dosing following resolution of events, a finding that is important for clinical care. In comparator groups, symptomatic and asymptomatic instances were adjudicated as reversible in 4 of 6 (66.7%) and 11 of 21 (52%), respectively. Thromboembolic, dysrhythmic and/or CV deaths were not significantly higher in sunitinib-treated patients.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930624","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.779949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.774204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.731169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.721059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.657486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.308549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0912894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0226131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"}]}
