{"id":84913,"title":"Association between the IRS1 and FTO genes regulates body weight in rabbits.","abstract":"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins play key roles in signal transduction in insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling to control postnatal growth. The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein also play an essential role in postnatal growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the IRS1 and FTO genes and the regulation of growth traits in rabbits. A total of nine synonymous SNPs were detected in the IRS1 coding sequence using direct sequencing, and the c.189G>T and c.2574G>A SNPs from two linkage disequilibrium blocks were further genotyped for association analysis in 216 New Zealand rabbits. The association results revealed that the TT genotype of c.189G>T and the AA genotype of c.2574G>A were significantly associated with higher body weight at 70 (BW70) and 84 (BW84) days of age and with higher average daily gain (P<0.05). Linear-regression analysis revealed that the two-gene combination model of FTO c.499G>A and IRS1 c.2574G>A was associated with BW70 and BW84. The combination model of the GA genotype of FTO c.499G>A with the AA genotype of IRS1 c.2574G>A was associated with preferred values for BW70 and BW84. The performance values for the FTO c.499G>A genotypes after stratification with regard to the IRS1 c.189G>T genotypes revealed that the TT genotype of IRS1 c.189G>T reduced the FTO c.499G>A significance associated with BW70 and BW84. Together, our data indicated that the IRS1 gene was associated with growth traits in rabbits. The IRS1 and FTO combination model may be exploited to assist breeders in selecting rabbits with preferred body weight.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25014140","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.756407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"IRS1","weight":0.74591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS1"},{"name":"Insulin receptor","weight":0.70278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_receptor"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.614156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.614035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.407582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Linkage disequilibrium","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Insulin receptor substrate","weight":0.194893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_receptor_substrate"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.153596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.129709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Internal Revenue Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"I.R.S.
