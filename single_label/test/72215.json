{"id":72215,"title":"[Research progress in cytoplasmic PML gene functions].","abstract":"The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) was originally identified and named as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) . The PML, encoded by PML gene, locates in the nuclear body (NB) and shuttles in the cell nucleus-cytoplasm, so that PML completes many regulation functions. There are many research on the function of nuclear PML, but in recent years the foreign data indicate that cytoplasmic PML gene plays an important role in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In this article, the biological functions of PML gene in cytoplasm are reviewed.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989309","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.39545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.255994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Acute promyelocytic leukemia","weight":0.229578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_promyelocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0960416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
