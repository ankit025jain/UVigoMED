{"id":83584,"title":"[What lipid emulsion should be administered to ICU patients?].","abstract":"The review deals with a question what lipid emulsion should be administered to ICU patients according to recently published official parenteral and enteral nutrition guidelines. Classic lipid emulsions based on omega-6 fatty acids are immunosuppressive and should not be used with ICU patients. The olive/soy emulsion is immunoneutral and can be used for most patients. Many ICU patients are in an inflammatory state (e.g. sepsis, ARDS, pancreatitis). A common belief is that this \"hyperinflammed patient population\" would profit from an anti-inflammatory lipid component of their parenteral nutrition solution, such as fish oil. On the other hand, every anti-inflammatory therapy has the disadvantage of also being immunosuppressive. Inflammation is a necessary part of the host defense against infection and any correct anti-inflammatory medication presupposes the exact immunologic knowledge that there is too much inflammation for a given situation. This \"too much\" is certainly not fulfilled in every patient with sepsis, ARDS or pancreatitis. At the bedside it is nearly impossible to determine the degree of \"hyper\" inflammation. In reality, a number of these patients may be adequately inflamed or, in fact, even hypoinflammed. Specific emulsions which can be used in hyper- or hypoinflammation should be developed in the future. As long as these difficulties in the immunologic diagnosis prevail, the clinician might be best advised to use an immunoneutral lipid emulsion when choosing a lipid preparation for the ICU patients.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306684","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.776646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.690852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.580195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.531798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.486593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Fish oil","weight":0.462832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_oil"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.422873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.384641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.321528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0682475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Bachelor's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
