{"id":29975,"title":"Role of the kappa-opioid receptor system in stress-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking in rats.","abstract":"The correlation between stress and smoking is well established. The mechanisms that underlie this relationship are, however, unclear. Recent data suggest that the kappa-opioid system is involved in the mediation of negative affective states associated with stress thereby promoting drug addiction and relapse. Pharmacological treatments targeting the kappa-opioid system and this mechanism may prove to be useful therapeutics for nicotine addiction in the future.We sought to determine whether there was a stress-specific role of the kappa-opioid system in nicotine seeking behavior.Groups of male Long Evans rats were trained to self-administer nicotine intravenously; their operant responding for nicotine was extinguished prior to tests of reinstatement. Pretreatment with systemic injections of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) was given prior to tests of stress (systemic injections of yohimbine (YOH)) or cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking. Systemic injections of the KOR agonist U50,488 were also given in a test for reinstatement of nicotine seeking.Nor-BNI pretreatment at 1h and 24h prior to testing was able to block YOH-induced, but not cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking. U50,488 reinstated nicotine seeking behavior in a dose-dependent manner.These findings support the hypothesis that the kappa-opioid system is involved in relapse to nicotine seeking induced by stress, but not by conditioned cues. KOR antagonists such as nor-BNI may therefore be useful novel therapeutic agents for decreasing the risk of stress-induced drug relapse.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583188","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.704189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.686541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Operant conditioning","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.536657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.429685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.350918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.2695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.239412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Yohimbine","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohimbine"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
