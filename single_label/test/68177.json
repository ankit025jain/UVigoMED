{"id":68177,"title":"TOT approach in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) - outcome in obese female.","abstract":"Only limited data are available on the outcome of tension-free obturator tape (TOT) procedures in overweight and obese women. We would like to verify the objective and subjective outcomes of TOT in women with a higher body mass index (BMI).We evaluated the records of 116 patients who had undergone TOT, stratifying by BMI into normal weight (n = 31), overweight (n = 56), and obese (n = 29) groups. We compared pre- and postoperative evaluations, including subjective and objective outcome of TOT, complications, and quality of life assessed by validated questionnaires (ICIQ-SF and KHQ).The median follow-up was 21 months. There were no significant differences between different groups in terms of objective cure rate and subjective success, quality of life scores and postoperative complications.Our data demonstrate that TOT procedure is safe and effective. BMI did not influence the outcome of TOT procedures at a median of 21 months after surgery and represents no contraindication for continence surgery. The success of the outcome of TOT procedure in females and the occurrence of complications are not negatively affected by obesity.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552585","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.657598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.624787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.560937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.445357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.442598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Videotape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Match fixing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Stratification (water)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(water)"},{"name":"KHQ-TV","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHQ-TV"},{"name":"TOT S.C.","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOT_S.C."},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"}]}
