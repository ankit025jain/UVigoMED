{"id":76488,"title":"Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in apparently healthy children in north India.","abstract":"The data on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in apparently healthy children from India is limited.To assess the prevalence of VDD in apparently healthy children.Prospective study.Apparently healthy children from the age groups of 3 months-12 years, from the upper socioeconomical status (USES), attending the outpatient department (OPD) of a private pediatric hospital in Chandigarh, India, for minor ailments were enrolled over a period of 6 months (March-August 2013).Plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were measured by competitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.In total, 338 children (188 boys, 150 girls) with mean age of 3.31 years were enrolled. The percentages of children with deficient, insufficient, and sufficient levels of 25(OH)D were 40.24%, 25.44%, and 34.32%, respectively. Clinical signs of VDD were seen in only 8.53% of the children. The mean (Â±SD) levels of 25(OH)D were 27.48 (15.99) ng/mL. On univariate analysis, deficient levels of 25(OH)D were associated with relatively younger age group, female sex, failure to thrive, exclusive breastfeeding, inadequate sun exposure, and no vitamin D supplements.A high prevalence of clinical and biochemical VDD was noted in apparently healthy children belonging to the USES.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
