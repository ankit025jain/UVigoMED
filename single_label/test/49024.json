{"id":49024,"title":"Evaluation of final height prediction and selected parameters in Polish patients with severe and partial growth hormone deficiency.","abstract":"The main goal of growth hormone therapy is to reach the height in the population ranges. The aim of the study was the comparison of selected methods for predicting final height in Polish patients with severe (sGHD) and partial (pGHD) growth hormone deficiency.149 children with growth hormone deficiency treated with rhGH in the Department of Pediatrics, Endocrinology, Diabetology, Metabolic Diseases and Cardiology Developmental Age, PUM, in Szczecin, in 2000-2010 have been evaluated. Patient were divided into two groups: sGHD and pGHD. Two methods of final height prediction have been used: Roche-Weiner-Thissen (RWT) and target height (TH), results were compared to the final height (FH). 117 children finished therapy in the analysed period and reached final height.The mean FH was similar in both groups. There was no significant difference between the accuracy of prediction methods of TH and RWT between groups of pGHD v. sGHD. Further analysis revealed, that in the group of boys with sGHD the prediction error of RWT was significantly lower than of the TH method (p < 0.05).It seems that in the group of boys with sGHD RWT is a more accurate method than TH.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977976","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Szczecin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Growth hormone deficiency","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_deficiency"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"5-alpha-reductase deficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-alpha-reductase_deficiency"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Diabetology","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetology"}]}
