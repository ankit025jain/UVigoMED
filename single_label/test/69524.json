{"id":69524,"title":"Design, synthesis, and evaluation of conformationally restricted acetanilides as potent and selective ?3 adrenergic receptor agonists for the treatment of overactive bladder.","abstract":"A series of conformationally restricted acetanilides were synthesized and evaluated as ?3-adrenergic receptor agonists (?3-AR) for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Optimization studies identified a five-membered ring as the preferred conformational lock of the acetanilide. Further optimization of both the aromatic and thiazole regions led to compounds such as 19 and 29, which have a good balance of potency and selectivity. These compounds have significantly reduced intrinsic clearance compared to our initial series of pyridylethanolamine ?3-AR agonists and thus have improved unbound drug exposures. Both analogues demonstrated dose dependent ?3-AR mediated responses in a rat bladder hyperactivity model.
