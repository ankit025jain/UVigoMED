{"id":51594,"title":"Assessment of tumor size as a useful marker for the surgical staging of endometrial cancer.","abstract":"Accumulating evidence suggests that the estimation of tumor size may improve endometrial cancer treatment. We conducted an observational study aimed at elucidating the association between tumor size and other universally accepted prognostic factors in order to identify suitable preoperative parameters which can guide surgery in a subgroup of early corpus endometrial cancer. We found that when tumor size increased, both stage and grading were significantly increased. Tumor size was correlated with CA 125 serum values, node metastasis and peritoneal cytology status. Patients who have grade 1 or 2 endometrioid corpus cancer, myometrial invasion < 50% and ? 3 cm largest tumor diameter can only be treated with hysterectomy. The tumor largest diameter should be evaluated as a preoperative parameter that indicates patients who do not require lymphadenectomy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676344","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.600507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.57494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.568419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.457418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.379467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Myometrium","weight":0.316275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myometrium"},{"name":"Endometrioid tumor","weight":0.160705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioid_tumor"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
