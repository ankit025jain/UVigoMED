{"id":78314,"title":"Preparation and identification of Per a 5 as a novel American cockroach allergen.","abstract":"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) from various arthropods can elicit allergic reactions. In the present study, Per a 5, a GST, was cloned from American cockroach (CR) and expressed in both baculovirus-infected insect cell (iPer a 5) and E. coli expression (bPer a 5) systems. The secondary structures were predicted to be 45.93 and 8.69% of ?-helix ?-sheets in iPer a 5 and 42.54 and 8.49% of ?-helix and ?-sheets in bPer a 5, respectively. It is found that 4 out of 16 (25%) sera from American CR allergy patients reacted to both bPer a 9 and iPer a 9 as assessed by ELISA and Western blotting analysis, confirming that Per a 5 is not a major allergen of American CR. Induction of upregulated expression of CD63 and CCR3 on passively sensitized human basophils (sera from American CR allergy patients) by approximately up to 4.5- and 3.2-fold indicates that iPer a 5 and bPer a 5 are functionally active. Recombinant Per a 5 (rPer a 5) should be a useful tool for studying and understanding the role of Per a 5 in CR allergy.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707117","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.886534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Insect","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.600491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Basophil granulocyte","weight":0.573269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cockroach","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach"},{"name":"Arthropod","weight":0.404822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.329274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.270229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"American cockroach","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cockroach"},{"name":"IPer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPer"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"CD63","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD63"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Critically Endangered","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"}]}
