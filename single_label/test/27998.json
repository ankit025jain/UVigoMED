{"id":27998,"title":"Feasibility of providing interventions for injection drug users in pharmacy settings: a case study among San Francisco pharmacists.","abstract":"In addition to syringe exchange programs, pharmacies are important venues where injection drug users (IDUs) can access non-prescription syringes and other prevention interventions. This study assessed the feasibility of providing a range of interventions for IDUs in pharmacy settings. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 participants (policy makers, owner/managers, dispensing pharmacists, and pharmacy staff) from independent and chain/retail pharmacies in San Francisco, California, USA. The highest level of support was for a coupon syringe program and educational materials. Several overarching themes illustrate challenges to implementing pharmacy-based preventive interventions: time, space, sufficient staff, pharmacist training, legal considerations, pharmacist attitudes toward IDUs, and cost and reimbursement issues. This study provides concrete examples of the types of preventive services that pharmacists support and consider feasible, and illustrates that pharmacists welcome the opportunity to broaden their role as critical partners in public health matters related to injection drug use.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052881","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.752328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.72345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.61624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"San Francisco","weight":0.612516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.587328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.583299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Over-the-counter drug","weight":0.543214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug"},{"name":"California","weight":0.509685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.461767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.434575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.246245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Concrete","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Theme music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_music"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Music venue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_venue"},{"name":"Student exchange program","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_exchange_program"},{"name":"Independent music","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music"}]}
