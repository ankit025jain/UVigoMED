{"id":4488,"title":"[Locomo 25--a screening tool for risk of locomotive syndrome].","abstract":"Locomo 25 was developed as a screening tool of locomotive syndrome by Japanese orthopedic surgeon group in 2008. It contains 25 questions in terms of musculoskeletal disorder such as walking disability, difficulty in daily living, or suffering pain on body. Its reliability and validity were already confirmed through multi-center study including 731 Japanese elderly people (over 65 y.o. average 77 y.o.). The cutoff score for identifying locomotive syndrome was set at 16, and list-upped person is considered as under high-risk condition who may soon require care services without some medical interventions. We can use Locomo 25 not only as a screening tool of locomotive syndrome but also as a measuring scale for evaluating effects of interventions in individuals.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509812","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.800885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.692599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.421364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cutscore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscore"},{"name":"Locomotive","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive"}]}
