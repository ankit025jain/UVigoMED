{"id":90264,"title":"Pediatric liver lacerations and intensive care: evaluation of ICU triage strategies.","abstract":"To compare PICU admission criteria following blunt traumatic liver laceration based on CT grade and/or physiologic instability with actual practice to improve efficiency of ICU admission.Retrospective cohort study.Patients with grade 3-6 liver lacerations, 2002-2010.Hundred seventy-one infants and children, ages 1 month to 17 years.None.Preadmission signs of physiologic instability (i.e., coma and cardiac arrest), liver CT grading, and outcomes including length of stay and packed RBC transfusion after admission to ICU were collected. Multiple body region severe trauma was defined as more than or equal to 1 extra-abdominal body area abbreviated injury score more than or equal to 4. Actual ICU admissions were compared with predicted. Two patients died before ICU admission and five (3%) died afterward. Of 169 patients, 52 (31%) were initially admitted to the inpatient ward. Five percent received surgical care for liver injury. Twenty percent received packed RBCs emergently for shock, whereas 5% received their first packed RBCs after admission. Compared with ICU admissions, ward patients were significantly older, had lower Injury Severity Scores, and less operative care. Among ICU patients, transfusion for hemorrhagic shock was significantly associated with more severe injury scores. Sixty percent of ICU patients were not transfused. ICU triage determined by signs of physiologic instability predicted 53 admissions (31%) including seven of nine patients (78%) treated with transfusions after admission. Predicted ICU admission for nontransfused patients was lower-9%. Adding CT laceration grade more than or equal to 4 increased ICU admissions to 129 (76%). Among surviving ICU patients, 37 of 62 patients (60%) with isolated severe abdominal trauma and no systemic instability had ICU length of stay less than 1 day.Children with isolated abdominal injury and no physiologic instability can generally be treated without ICU admission. Adding grade more than or equal to 4 to usual ICU admission criteria resulted in excessive admission of stable patients.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632581","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.774743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.752252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.716466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.556656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.442598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.403971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Laceration","weight":0.349269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laceration"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.219945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.154507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Acronym and initialism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism"}]}
