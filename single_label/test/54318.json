{"id":54318,"title":"Serum potassium is an age-dependent risk factor for pre-diabetes and diabetes in the Israeli population.","abstract":"We analysed the association between serum potassium, within the normal range, and early signs of diabetes in an Israeli population.A computerized database of the Clalit Health Services was used for obtaining information regarding patients' baseline serum potassium levels. The main study outcome was dysglycaemia, defined as fasting glucose > 100 mg/dL, HbA1C > 6.5 gr% (48 mmol/mol) or a new diagnosis of diabetes. A secondary outcome was overt diabetes.Included in the study were 71,597 patients, mean age 40.8 ± 13.4 years. After a mean follow-up period of 5.3 ± 2.2 years, dysglycaemia decreased [odds ratio (OR) = 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.906-0.997; p = 0.038], as did the incidence of overt diabetes (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.793-0.934; p = 0.0001), for every 1 mmol/L elevation in serum potassium in the normal range. But analysis of subpopulation reveals that when elevated serum potassium was associated with low adjusted ORs for predicting dysglycaemia (OR = 0.904 with a 95% CI of 0.849-0.963; p = 0.002), the opposite effect was demonstrated over the age of 41 years (OR = 1.113 with a 95% CI of 1.048-1.104; p < 0.001).This study demonstrates age-related association between serum potassium and the risk of dysglycaemia.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464151","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence
