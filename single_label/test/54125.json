{"id":54125,"title":"Ovarian cancer presenting as a metastasis to a trocar tract used for a gasless lift-laparoscopy to resect a benign ovarian cyst: an unusual case report.","abstract":"Metastasis to a trocar tract (port-site metastasis, PSM) is an uncommon but serious complication that possibly compromises the prognosis of cancer patients treated laparoscopically.A 42-year-old Japanese woman had a 20-cm benign right ovarian cyst resected using gasless lift-laparoscopy. Five years and eight months postoperatively, she noticed a three-cm subcutaneous tumor involving the trocar tract. She was also found to have a pelvic mass and an exploratory laparotomy revealed left ovarian cancer. Based on the histopathological findings, the subcutaneous tumor was diagnosed as a metastasis from the ovarian cancer.This case suggested that PSM could occur without direct or indirect wound contamination during laparoscopic surgery.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475589","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Ovarian cyst","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cyst"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.665601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.560982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Trocar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocar"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"}]}
