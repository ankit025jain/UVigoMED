{"id":68616,"title":"Successful maternal and fetal outcome in a kidney transplant patient with everolimus exposure throughout pregnancy: a case report.","abstract":"Pregnancy after kidney transplantation is becoming more common as more patients of childbearing age are undergoing successful transplantation. There is limited evidence on the safety and efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors during pregnancy, which are considered Category C. We will review the use of this class of medications in pregnancy, which is currently contraindicated due to risk of fetal complications. We will also present the case of a successful pregnancy and renal outcome in a 33-year-old kidney transplant recipient who was administered everolimus throughout pregnancy.
