{"id":54203,"title":"Recombinant lentivirus targeting the pleotrophin gene reduces pleotrophin protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells and inhibits neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons.","abstract":"The objectives of the present study were to construct the recombinant primate lentivirus?short hairpin RNA-pleiotrophin (pLV-shRNA-PTN) vector, to investigate the silencing effect of pLV-shRNA-PTN on PTN expression in MIA PaCa-2 cells and to observe the inhibition efficiency of pLV-shRNA?PTN on neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro. The construction procedure for recombinant lentivirus pLV-shRNA-PTN has been described previously. In the present study, pLV-shRNA?PTN was used to infect MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells and the efficiency of the knockdown of the PTN gene on day 7 following infection was analyzed using western blotting. The morphological changes in the cultured DRG neurons were observed by monoculture of DRG neurons and co-culture with MIA PaCa-2 cells in vitro. The recombinant lentivirus pLV-shRNA?PTN was successfully constructed. The western blot analysis showed that the inhibition rates of PTN expression were 46, 80, 20 and 21%, respectively, following pLV-shRNA?PTN-A, B, C and D infection. pLV-shRNA-PTN?B showed the highest knockdown efficiency. DRG neurons co-cultured with infected MIA PaCa-2 cells were decreased in size when compared with the control, and there was a significant decrease in the number and length of neurites. The results suggest that efficient and specific knockdown of PTN in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells and the subsequent reduction in PTN expression results in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth from DRG neurons.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469464","annotations":[{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.916951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.893457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dorsal root ganglion","weight":0.597601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_root_ganglion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neurite","weight":0.536896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurite"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.536344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.304946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.265351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Monoculture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
