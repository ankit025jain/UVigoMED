{"id":39817,"title":"Does intramesorectal excision for ulcerative colitis impact bowel and sexual function when compared with total mesorectal excision?","abstract":"Proctectomy for ulcerative colitis (UC) can be performed via intramesorectal (IME) or total mesorectal excision (TME).We compared patient-reported bowel and sexual function among IME versus TME UC patients (September 2000 to March 2011) using the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function scale, Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life, Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, Female Sexual Function Instrument, and International Index of Erectile Dysfunction surveys.Eighty-nine IME versus TME patients (35 Â± 2 years, 57% male, 62% IME) had similar baseline characteristics, although IME patients had more open procedures (P ? .03). IME patients reported better fecal continence (P = .009) but similar fecal incontinence-related quality of life (P ? .44). For sexual function, there were no differences for either women (Female Sexual Function Instrument; P ? .20) or men (International Index of Erectile Dysfunction; P ? .22).IME appears to be associated with better fecal continence but no difference in overall bowel or sexual function compared with TME in patients with UC.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124292","annotations":[{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.865968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.74293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.683353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.577076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.548671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Total mesorectal excision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_mesorectal_excision"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Dysfunction (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunction_(album)"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Input method","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method"}]}
