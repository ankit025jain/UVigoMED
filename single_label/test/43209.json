{"id":43209,"title":"Vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine that often develops in the young. A few new treatment options have become available in the past decade, but management of a large proportion of patients still remains challenging because of side effects, unresponsiveness and cost. A novel strategy targeting trafficking of immune cells to the sites of inflammation involves reducing expression or binding of adhesion molecules to integrins. Natalizumab was the first therapeutic antibody blocking infiltration of leukocytes, but because of lack of selectivity to the gut and associated risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, it will probably never be tested in ulcerative colitis. In this article we discuss molecules that block leukocyte trafficking to inflamed bowel that have been tested in ulcerative colitis. Because of favourable efficacy and safety data, we will review the development, pharmacology and clinical data of vedolizumab, a gut-selective ?4?7 antibody, in depth.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802046","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","weight":0.888537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.762605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.734911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.643407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Natalizumab","weight":0.637782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalizumab"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.575423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.140264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
