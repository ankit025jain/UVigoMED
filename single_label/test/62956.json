{"id":62956,"title":"Arm and shoulder morbidity following surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer.","abstract":"To explore the relationship between radiotherapy (RT) dose levels in the arm/shoulder region and arm/shoulder morbidity in breast cancer patients.This study included 183 breast cancer patients who had received locoregional RT with or without chemotherapy and/or hormone treatment during the period 1998-2002. Individual RT dose level, reflected by dose-volume histograms (DVHs), for the shoulder joint and joining structures were obtained from archived CT-based RT plans. Individual median, mean and maximum arm/shoulder RT dose levels were extracted. Arm/shoulder morbidity was assessed 29-58 months after breast cancer treatment using the following clinical endpoints: arm pain, arm stiffness, swollen arm, use of arm, numbness, shoulder flexion and shoulder abduction difference, fibrosis and breast cancer-related lymphedema. The relationship between arm/shoulder RT dose level and these clinical endpoints was assessed by Spearman's correlation and multivariate logistic regression.Ninety-one percent of the included patients had some degree of arm/shoulder morbidity. Neither mean nor maximum RT dose level was associated with clinical endpoints. However, significant correlations (p < 0.05) were found between DVHs and arm stiffness, arm pain, use of arm and shoulder abduction difference, when arm/shoulder RT dose levels were approximately 15 Gy.Three-dimensional conformal locoregional RT for breast cancer results in long-term arm/shoulder morbidity. To minimize this risk, large shoulder volumes receiving RT doses of approximately 15 Gy should be reduced.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495044","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.626731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.604058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.564437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.525218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.472164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.419741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.368282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.258789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.146861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Histogram","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Conformal map","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Breast cancer treatment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_treatment"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"}]}
