{"id":83135,"title":"Effect of electric toothbrush on residents' oral hygiene: a randomized clinical trial in nursing homes.","abstract":"A single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial was performed to investigate the effect of electric toothbrushes (ET) compared with manual toothbrushes (MT) on residents in nursing homes and to evaluate the caregiver's opinion on ET. A sample of 180 nursing-home residents were given either a new ET or a new MT. Oral examinations were performed to measure dental hygiene, using the Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified (OHI-S). Both groups received the same instructions for use. After 2 months participants were re-examined. Questionnaires were then sent to their caregivers. Participants' mean age was 86.1 ± 7.7 yr, and the mean number of remaining teeth was 20 ± 5.6. No specific intervention effect was found for ET. Both groups showed identical improvements in the OHI-S, from 1.27 ± 0.63 at baseline (the mean value for all participants) to 1.01 ± 0.53 after 2 months. Of 152 caregivers who responded to the questionnaire, the majority evaluated ET to be beneficial and less time-consuming compared with MT, also for demented residents. In a frail population, no difference is found in the effect of ET compared with MT. However, the ET appears to be a useful aid for residents who receive assistance with dental hygiene.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438077","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.680583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dental hygienist","weight":0.645114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_hygienist"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.511352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.479276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.38509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Electric toothbrush","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_toothbrush"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Montana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Reexamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reexamination"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
