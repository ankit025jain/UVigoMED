{"id":38567,"title":"Pain location and intensity impacts function in persons with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy with chronic pain.","abstract":"We examined the effects of pain site and intensity on function in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and chronic pain.Questionnaires assessing pain sites, pain extent (number of sites), pain intensity, and pain interference were completed by 182 individuals with DM1 (43%) or FSHD (57%) and chronic pain.There was a positive association between pain extent and intensity with pain interference, and a negative association with psychological functioning in both DM1 and FSHD. Pain intensity at specific sites had differential impact beyond the effects of pain intensity alone. Head pain intensity independently affected psychological functioning, whereas leg, foot, hip, and knee pain contributed independently to the prediction of pain interference.Pain site and intensity differentially modulates the effect of chronic pain on function in DM1 and FSHD patients. Researchers and clinicians should consider these factors when assessing and treating pain.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415580","annotations":[{"name":"Headache","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.55743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.271115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.0627902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Myotonic dystrophy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotonic_dystrophy"},{"name":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facioscapulohumeral_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Modulation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_(music)"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
