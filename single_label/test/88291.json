{"id":88291,"title":"Comparison of tension band wiring and precontoured locking compression plate fixation in Mayo type IIA olecranon fractures.","abstract":"Aim of the present study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcome of tension band wiring and precontoured locking compression plate fixation in patients treated surgically for an isolated olecranon fractures type IIA according to the Mayo classification. Of 26 patients presenting with an isolated Mayo type IIA olecranon fracture, 13 underwent fixation with a precontoured locking compression plate (group A), 13 patients were treated with tension band wiring (group B). At a mean follow-up of 43 months, patients were clinically and radiographically re-examined using the DASH score, the Mayo Elbow Performance score (MEPS) and anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. The mean DASH score was 14 points in group A and 12.5 points in group B. Regarding the MEPS, 92% of the patients in group A achieved a good to excellent results in comparison to 77% in group B. No significant differences between the two groups could be detected regarding the clinical and radiographic outcome. Implant-related irritations requiring hardware removal occurred more frequently in group B (12 vs. 7). Procedure and implant related costs were significantly higher in group A. Tension band wiring is still a preferable surgical method to treat simple isolated olecranon fractures. The patient must be informed that in all likelihood implant removal will be required once the fracture has healed. Fixation with precontoured locking compression plates does not provide better functional and radiographic outcome but is more expensive than tension band wiring.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873093","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.562029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.504853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Olecranon","weight":0.355441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olecranon"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.306299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Type II string theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_string_theory"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Institute of Internal Auditors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Internal_Auditors"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Reexamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reexamination"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
