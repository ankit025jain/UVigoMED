{"id":56364,"title":"Lamellar keratoplasty following thermokeratoplasty in the treatment of acute corneal hydrops.","abstract":"To observe the efficacy of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) for treatment of acute hydrops in keratoconus after anterior chamber paracentesis combined with thermokeratoplasty.Retrospective, noncomparative clinical case series.Twenty-one patients (21 eyes) suffering acute hydrops associated with keratoconus were treated first by anterior chamber paracentesis combined with thermokeratoplasty. At 1 week after the edema was absorbed, and Descemet membrane ruptures and stromal clefts were cured, all patients received modified DALK. Descemet membrane re-ruptures during surgery were recorded, if any. Graft transparency, visual acuity, recipient folds or opacity, and immune rejection were monitored for 6 months to 1 year.All the corneal edema alleviated rapidly, and the intrastromal clefts narrowed within 1 week after combined anterior chamber paracentesis and thermokeratoplasty. DALK was performed successfully in all patients within 2 weeks after the first surgical procedure, with no Descemet membrane rebreaking or corneal perforation. The recipients were completely clear in 7 eyes, and mild fusiform scars appeared at the central recipient in 14 eyes. All the opacity of Descemet membrane ruptures became slight or even disappeared after 6 months. The mean best-corrected visual acuity was improved to 20/30 at 1 year after DALK. No immune rejection occurred.Anterior chamber paracentesis combined with thermokeratoplasty can accelerate the absorption of corneal edema in patients with acute corneal hydrops (within 1 week) and Descemet membrane rupture healing without obvious opacity (within 2 weeks). During this window phase, DALK could be performed safely, and good visual acuity may be obtained.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699158","annotations":[{"name":"Edema","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.726851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.592414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.526748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Paracentesis","weight":0.454088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracentesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Descemet's membrane","weight":0.151923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descemet's_membrane"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.104895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.0989523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.0886762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0663472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0547481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0339747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Corneal perforation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_perforation"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Fold (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(geology)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Lamella (materials)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_(materials)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
