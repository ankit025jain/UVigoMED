{"id":4396,"title":"[Epidemiological analysis of malaria prevalence in Jiangsu Province in 2012].","abstract":"To understand the malaria epidemic situation and characteristics in Jiangsu Province in 2012, so as to provide the evidence for formulating and adjusting effective malaria elimination strategies and measures.The reported malaria cases from the Internet Reporting System and the epidemiological data of malaria in Jiangsu Province were collected and analyzed.A total of 198 malaria cases were reported in Jiangsu Province in 2012 with the incidence of 0.026/10 000, which decreased by 47.06% compared with that in 2011(374 cases). A total of 198 malaria cases were reported from 13 prefectures of Jiangsu and the cases were mainly distributed in Yangzhou (34 cases), Nantong (31 cases), Nanjing (22 cases), Taizhou (21 cases), Xuzhou (17 cases) and Huaian (17 cases), which accounted for 71.72% (142/198) among the total cases of the province. There were no local malaria cases reported from Jiangsu in 2012, and the imported malaria cases from other countries decreased by 45.15% compared with that in 2011.For the first time, there are no local malaria cases reported from Jiangsu in 2012. However, the imported case distribution is further expanded and the infected plasmodium parasites are more diverse. Imported malaria from other countries remains the key for malaria control in Jiangsu Province.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345154","annotations":[{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.7638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.654165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Nantong","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantong"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.337222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Yangzhou","weight":0.311111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou"},{"name":"Taizhou, Zhejiang","weight":0.199501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taizhou,_Zhejiang"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.130712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Xuzhou","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuzhou"},{"name":"Huai'an","weight":0.0550013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai'an"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Prefectures of Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Report","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}]}
