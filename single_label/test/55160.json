{"id":55160,"title":"Prentice medal lecture 2013: visual accessibility: a challenge for low-vision research.","abstract":"Low vision may be defined as any chronic form of vision impairment, not correctable by glasses or contact lenses, that adversely affects everyday function. Visual accessibility refers to factors that make an environment, device, or display usable by vision. In this article, I discuss the concept of visual accessibility with special reference to low vision. What role can vision science play in enhancing visual accessibility for people with low vision? I propose that greater efforts to embed low-vision research in real-world contexts and collaboration with other disciplines will accelerate progress. I describe examples from my current research projects on architectural accessibility and reading accessibility.
