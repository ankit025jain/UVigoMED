{"id":9325,"title":"The optimal concentration of topical hydroxycamptothecin in preventing intraarticular scar adhesion.","abstract":"10-Hydroxycamptothecin could reduce intraarticular adhesion by inhibiting fibroblasts proliferation after knee surgery. However, the ideal concentration of hydroxycamptothecin have not been defined. This study was tried to verify the optimal concentration of 10-hydroxycamptothecin in preventing knee intraarticular adhesion. Sixty rabbits were randomly divided into five groups. Approximately 10?mm Ã— 10?mm of the cortical bone was removed from both sides of the femoral condyle and the underneath cancellous bone was exposed. Various concentrations of hydroxycamptothecin (0.1?mg/ml, 0.5?mg/ml, 1.0?mg/ml, 2.0?mg/ml) or saline were applied to the decorticated areas for 10 minutes. After four weeks, the degree of inraarticular adhesion was assessed by macroscopic evaluation, biochemical analysis of hydroxyproline content and histological evaluation. The results demonstrated that the extent of knee inraarticular adhesion in 1.0?mg/ml group and 2.0?mg/ml hydroxycamptothecin group were significantly lower than those of 0.5?mg/ml group, 0.1?mg/ml hydroxycamptothecin group and control group. Moreover, there was no significant difference between 1.0?mg/ml group and 2.0?mg/ml hydroxycamptothecin group. In conclusion, topical application of 1.0?mg/ml hydroxycamptothecin may be the optimal concentration in reducing intraarticular adhesion after knee surgery in rabbits.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714729","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.731343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.680956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.567805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.468066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.419148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.278171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hydroxyproline","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyproline"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"10mm Auto","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10mm_Auto"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Bark","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Lower extremity of femur","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_femur"}]}
