{"id":7148,"title":"Critical analysis of endocrine disruptive activity of triclosan and its relevance to human exposure through the use of personal care products.","abstract":"This review examines the mammalian and human literature pertaining to the potential endocrine disruptive effects of triclosan (TCS). Dietary exposure to TCS consistently produces a dose-dependent decrease in serum thyroxine (T4) in rats without any consistent change in TSH or triiodothyronine (T3). Human studies reveal no evidence that the TCS exposure through personal care product use affects the thyroid system. TCS binds to both androgen and estrogen receptors in vitro with low affinity and evokes diverse responses (e.g., agonist, antagonist, or none) in steroid receptor transfected cell-based reporter assays. Two of three studies in rats have failed to show that TCS exposure suppresses male reproductive function in vivo. Three of four studies have failed to show that TCS possesses estrogenic (or uterotrophic) activity in rats. However, two studies reported that, while TCS lacks estrogenic activity, it can amplify the action of estrogen in vivo. The in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies reviewed herein show little evidence that TCS adversely affects gestation or postpartum development of offspring. Furthermore, previously reported toxicity testing in a variety of mammalian species shows little evidence that TCS adversely affects thyroid function, male and female reproductive function, gestation, or postpartum development of offspring. Finally, doses of TCS reported to produce hypothyroxinemia, and occasional effects on male and female reproduction, gestation, and offspring in animal studies are several orders of magnitude greater than the estimated exposure levels of TCS in humans. Overall, little evidence exists that TCS exposure through personal care product use presents a risk of endocrine disruptive adverse health effects in humans.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Animal
