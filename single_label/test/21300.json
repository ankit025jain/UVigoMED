{"id":21300,"title":"Heparin-binding protein (HBP/CAP37) - a link to endothelin-1 in endotoxemia-induced pulmonary oedema?","abstract":"Vascular leakage and oedema formation are key components in sepsis. In septic patients, plasma levels of the vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) correlate with mortality. During sepsis, neutrophils release heparin-binding protein (HBP) known to increase vascular permeability and to be a promising biomarker of human sepsis. As disruption of ET-signalling in endotoxemia attenuates formation of oedema, we hypothesized that this effect could be related to decreased levels of HBP. To investigate this, we studied the effects of ET-receptor antagonism on plasma HBP and oedema formation in a porcine model of sepsis. In addition, to further characterize a potential endothelin/HBP interaction, we investigated the effects of graded ET-receptor agonist infusions.Sixteen anesthetized pigs were subjected to 5 h of endotoxemia and were randomized to receive either the ET-receptor antagonist tezosentan or vehicle after 2 h. Haemodynamics, gas-exchange and lung water were monitored. In separate experiments, plasma HBP was measured in eight non-endotoxemic animals exposed to graded infusion of ET-1 or sarafotoxin 6c.Endotoxemia increased plasma ET-1, plasma HBP, and extravascular lung water. Tezosentan-treatment markedly attenuated plasma HBP and extravascular lung water, and these parameters correlated significantly. Tezosentan decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and increased respiratory compliance. In non-endotoxemic pigs graded ET-1 and sarafotoxin 6c infusions caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma HBP.ET-receptor antagonism reduces porcine endotoxin-induced pulmonary oedema and plasma levels of the oedema-promoting protein HBP. Moreover, direct ET-receptor stimulation distinctively increases plasma HBP. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which ET-1 contributes to formation of oedema during experimental sepsis.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611481","annotations":[{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.705405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Vascular resistance","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_resistance"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.59774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.546629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.437076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.429832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Vascular permeability","weight":0.389764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_permeability"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.380451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Endotoxemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxemia"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
