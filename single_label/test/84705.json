{"id":84705,"title":"Application of platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of chronic skin ulcer - case report.","abstract":"The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has proved promising regarding its applicability in dermatology, especially in the healing of chronic ulcers. The autologous platelet-rich plasma is obtained by centrifuging the blood, so that the components are separated by density gradient. The final product is a gel rich in growth factors that act in tissue repair by activating fibroblasts and inducing extracellular matrix remodeling.
