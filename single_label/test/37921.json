{"id":37921,"title":"Ethanol embolotherapy of vascular malformations: clinical outcomes at a single center.","abstract":"To retrospectively evaluate the results of endovascular therapy of vascular malformations principally treated with ethanol embolization at a single center.From May 1999 to December 2012, 46 patients (28 female, 18 male) with vascular malformations (31 venous malformations, 15 arteriovenous malformations [AVMs]) throughout the body (nine upper extremity, 31 lower extremity, and six truncal) who underwent ethanol embolization were studied and followed up. Demographic factors, clinical findings, imaging data, and patient-reported changes in symptoms were collected and analyzed. Follow-up data were obtained by office visits, repeat imaging, and telephone contact.Twenty-four patients (52.2%) were considered cured, 12 (26.1%) showed improvement, and 10 (21.7%) had no change or showed worsening. Similar rates of cure or improvement were seen for AVMs and venous malformations (P = 0.67). Lesion location, depth, and size were not associated with differences in outcomes (P = .87, P = .37, and P = .61, respectively). Type 1 and type 2 AVMs were cured more often than other AVM types. The overall complication rate was 24% (11 of 46 patients). Minor complications were seen in six individuals (13%), and major complications developed in five patients (11%).Ethanol embolization of vascular malformations produces good outcomes, with control or relief of symptoms in a majority of patients.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461130","annotations":[{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.582015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.317046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.29772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.0886408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"September Six","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_Six"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
