{"id":54577,"title":"Type 2 diabetes is associated with low muscle mass in older adults.","abstract":"Our aim was to clarify the association between type 2 diabetes and the risk of low muscle mass in older adults.In the present study, 414 adults aged 65 years or older (144 patients with type 2 diabetes and 270 control participants) were included. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Low muscle mass was defined as the appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height(2) (ASM/Ht(2)) or appendicular skeletal muscle mass/weight (ASM/Wt) of <2 SD below the sex-specific normal mean of the young reference group, or <lower 20th percentile of total body skeletal muscle mass/weight (TSM/Wt) from control participants.Older men with type 2 diabetes showed significantly lower appendicular skeletal muscle mass than those without diabetes (19.5 ± 3.5 kg vs 21.0 ± 2.8 kg, P < 0.001). The prevalence of low muscle mass was consistently higher in older men with diabetes than those without diabetes defined by ASM/Ht(2) (57.6% vs 41.5%, P = 0.040), ASM/Wt (23.7% vs 12.3%, P = 0.046) and TSM/Wt (49.2% vs 20.0%, P < 0.001). In older women with diabetes, the prevalence of low muscle mass was higher than those without diabetes by ASM/Wt (25.9% vs 15.0%, P = 0.044) and TSM/Wt (32.9% vs 20.0%, P = 0.030), but not by ASM/Ht(2) (7.1% vs 8.6%, P = 0.685). The risk of low muscle mass was approximately two- to fourfold higher in older adults with type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting for age, body mass index, current smoking and other risk factors.In Korean older adults, type 2 diabetes is associated with low muscle mass.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450569","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.688496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.502215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.473824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.460881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.455041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.361872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.339232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.316807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"414","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/414"},{"name":"1 myriametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_myriametre"},{"name":"685","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/685"},{"name":"270","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/270"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Appendicular artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicular_artery"}]}
