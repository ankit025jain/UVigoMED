{"id":53602,"title":"Expression of PI3-K, PKB and GSK-3 ? in the skeletal muscle tissue of gestational diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"To analyze the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-K), protein kinase B (PKB) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 ?) in skeletal muscle tissue of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).A total of 90 cases of pregnant women were divided into observation group and control group according to the occurrence of GDM with 45 cases in either, and the expression of PI3-K, PKB, GSK-3 ? mRNA expression in skeletal muscle tissue was compared between two groups.The total PI3-K p85 protein was significantly higher in the observation group compared with the control group, the activity of PI3-K was lower than that of the latter; The total PKB, GSK-3 ? protein in skeletal tissue had no significant difference between two groups, while the serine phosphorylation levels of PKB and GSK-3? were significantly lower in observation group compared with the control group.The downregulation of PI3-K, PKB and GSK-3?in skeletal tissue of GDM caused by phosphorylation dysfunction of signaling molecules is the reason for insulin resistance and transporter function decline which lead to GDM.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System
