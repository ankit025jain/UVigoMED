{"id":18598,"title":"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells in cutaneous lesions of patients with chromoblastomycosis, lacaziosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis: a comparative analysis.","abstract":"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are characterized by expression of CD123 and BDCA-2 (Blood Dendritic Cell Antigen 2) (CD303) molecules, which are important in innate and adaptive immunity. Chromoblastomycosis (CBM), lacaziosis or Jorge Lobo's disease (JLD), and paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), are noteworthy in Latin America due to the large number of reported cases. The severity of lesions is mainly determined by the host's immune status and in situ responses. The dendritic cells studied in these fungal diseases are of myeloid origin, such as Langerhans cells and dermal dendrocytes; to our knowledge, there are no data for pDCs. Forty-three biopsies from patients with CBM, 42 from those with JLD and 46 diagnosed with PCM, were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Plasmacytoid cells immunostained with anti-CD123 and anti-CD303 were detected in 16 cases of CBM; in those stained with anti-CD123, 24 specimens were obtained from PCM. We did not detect the presence of pDCs in any specimen using either antibody in JLD. We believe that, albeit a secondary immune response in PCM and CBM, pDCs could act as a secondary source of important cytokines. The BDCA-2 (CD303) is a c-type lectin receptor involved in cell adhesion, capture, and processing of antigens. Through the expression of the c-lectin receptor, there could be an interaction with fungi, similar to other receptors of this type, namely, CD207 in PCM and CD205 and CD209 in other fungal infections. In JLD, the absence of expression of CD123 and CD303 seems to indicate that pDCs are not involved in the immune response.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
