{"id":8595,"title":"Preclinical evaluation of [¹¹¹ In]-DOTA-trastuzumab for clinical trials.","abstract":"Herceptin and its fragments have been radiolabeled and used in the imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-positive tumors and development of diagnostic kits is of great importance in radiopharmacy.In this study, ¹¹¹ In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-trastuzumab (¹¹¹ In-DOTA-trastuzumab) was successively prepared and evaluated for ultimate use in the HER2 antigen imaging in oncology.The conjugate was prepared, labeled and evaluated using in vitro (radioimmunoassay [RIA], enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), stability, binding, internalization)/in vivo (bio-distribution, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) experiments.¹¹¹ In-DOTA-trastuzumab was prepared followed by determination of radiochemical purity (RCP), integrity of protein, immunoreactivity of radiolabeled antibody with HER2/neu antigen (by SkBr3 cell line binding and RIA methods) were determined followed by stability tests, internalization studies and the tissue bio-distribution determination in wild-type rats as well as SPECT imaging in SkBr3-bearing mice.All values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD) and the data were compared using Student's t-test. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.¹¹¹ In-DOTA-trastuzumab was prepared (RCP >95 ± 0.5%, S.A. 5.3 ?Ci/?g) with the average number of chelators per antibody of 6:1 showing significant immune-reactivity retention using ELISA. In vitro stability was >90% in phosphate buffered saline and 80 ± 0.5% in serum over 48 h. Cell binding was significant (>0.79). In vitro internalization reached up to %12-13 in 10 h. Significant tumor uptake was observed.In vitro and in vivo/SPECT imaging in SkBr3-bearing mice demonstrated that ¹¹¹ In-DOTA-trastuzumab is a potential compound for molecular imaging of SPECT for diagnosis and follow-up of HER2 expression in oncology.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal
