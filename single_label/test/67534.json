{"id":67534,"title":"[Acyldepsipeptide 1 induces apoptosis in renal cancer cells by down-regulation of Gli and Bcl-2 via SHH pathway].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of acyldepsipeptide 1 (ADEP1) on renal cancer cell apoptosis and on the expressions of SHH signaling pathway related protein Gli-1 and Bcl-2.The renal cancer cells (ACHN and 769-P) were treated with 50 ?mol/L ADEP1 for 48 hours. The changes of cell morphology and the nucleus shape in cell apoptosis were observed under a light microscope, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The mRNA levels of SHH and Gli-1 were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and the protein levels of Gli-1 and Bcl-2 were determined by Western blotting.ADEP1 induced renal cancer cell apoptosis through reducing the transcription of SHH and Gli-1, and decreasing Gli-1 and Bcl-2 protein expressions.ADEP1 could induce renal cancer cell apoptosis by the inhibition on SHH signaling pathway related proteins.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606742","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Optical microscope","weight":0.746354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.677763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.620731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.591466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.5777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.517193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Sonic hedgehog","weight":0.273154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.228935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.186427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"GLI1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLI1"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
