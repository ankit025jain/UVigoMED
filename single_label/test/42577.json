{"id":42577,"title":"[Prognostic significance of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase before transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma].","abstract":"To evaluate the prognostic significance of serum GGT in patients with intermediate HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B) treated with TACE.A retrospective analysis was conducted on 162 intermediate HCC patients receiving TACE treatment in 301 Hospital Department of Interventional Radiology from August 2008 to December 2011. Survival rates and prognostic significance were compared between the 116 patients (High GGT group) and 46 patients (normal GGT group). The survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Log-rank method was used for univariate analysis, and the Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis.The level of GGT was statistically different (P < 0.01) in the high GGT group and normal GGT group before TACE, which was respectively (168 ± 121) U/L and (33 ± 9) U/L. After patients treated with TACE, the 1, 2 and 3 year survival rates were 54.3%, 33.6% and 25.0%, respectively, and the median survival time was 23.0 months in the high GGT group. The 1, 2 and 3 year survival rates were 87.0%, 56.5% and 41.3%, respectively, and the median survival time was 36.0 months in the normal GGT group. It has statistically significant(P = 0.000) on the median survival time. It was showed that the survival rares (P < 0.05) were relevant with the following several aspects by univariate analysis: the level of serum GGT before TACE, hepatocirrhosis, Child score, tumor size, tumor numbers and serum AFP level, and the prognosis-related factors were relevant with the following several aspects by Cox multiple regression analysis: the level of serum GGT before TACE, tumor numbers, serum AFP level and tumor size.The level of GGT before TACE was an important prognostic factor to predict the effect of TACE on patients with intermediate HCC.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842205","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular
