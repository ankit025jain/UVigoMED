{"id":77227,"title":"No strong relationship between body mass index and clinical hand osteoarthritis: results from a population-based case-control study.","abstract":"The aim of this population-based case-control study was to investigate whether a high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for clinical hand osteoarthritis (OA).Persons living in Ullensaker municipality in Norway who were aged 20-52 years in 1990 reported height and weight in 1990, 1994, 2004, and 2010 (n = 1276). Cases (clinical hand OA in 2010, n = 59) were compared to controls (participants without self-reported OA or hand pain in 2010, n = 805) with regard to the prospectively measured BMI by means of a generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis adjusted for age, sex, time, and education.The mean age of hand OA cases was 64 (SD = 7.5) years in 2010 and 78% were women. There was no association between total average BMI over the entire period and later clinical hand OA (p = 0.320). Cases had a higher mean BMI in 1990 [unstandardized B = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07-1.79] and in 1994 (B = 0.75, 95% CI 0.22-1.28) but there were no differences between the groups in 2004 or 2010.The study lend support to the hypothesis that having a higher BMI when young or middle-aged might be associated with later hand OA.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824945","annotations":[{"name":"Risk","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.456217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.352325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.260586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.240727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Ullensaker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullensaker"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"GEE (navigation)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEE_(navigation)"},{"name":"Generalized estimating equation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_estimating_equation"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"805","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/805"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"1276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1276"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"List of municipalities of Norway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_Norway"},{"name":"2052","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2052"},{"name":"Total average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_average"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"1994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
