{"id":80491,"title":"Indirect haemagglutination test and ELISA as compared to Kato thick-smear in diagnosing Schistosoma mansoni.","abstract":"The risk of schistosomiasis infection is associated to age, sex, and occupations. This study evaluated the reliable method for diagnosis of schistosomiasis in correlation to their sensitivity and specificity. A total of 75 patients (49 males and 27 females) with manifestations suggestive intestinal schistosomiasis, with ages less than 18 years old (46) and 29 above were enrolled. They were subjected to history taking and clinical and stool examinations. Stool examination was done by Kato-Katz technique, and detection of antibodies against S. mansoni by ELISA and IHAT. S. mansoni eggs were detected among 45 (60%) by microscopic examination (25 of them <18 years and 20 cases >25 years of old), while antibodies were recorded among 38 (50.7%) and 43 (57.3%) by both ELISA and IHA respectively, non-significant differences were recorded between the three applied methods of examination. On comparing IHA with Kato-Katz technique as gold standard method of diagnosis, it showed 80% sensitivity & 93.3% specificity. On other hand, ELISA revealed high sensitivity and specificity 96.9% & 90.7% respectively. On comparing Kato-Katz technique to IHA it showed low sensitivity and specificity; 78.9% & 59.5% respectively.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640882","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.806321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.752457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.484367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.351722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.328754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.266338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Hemagglutination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutination"},{"name":"Egg (food)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
