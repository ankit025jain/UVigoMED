{"id":79151,"title":"Simultaneous, unilateral plugging of superior and posterior semicircular canal dehiscences to treat debilitating hyperacusis.","abstract":"To describe a case of bilateral superior and posterior semicircular canal dehiscences, and the use of a unilateral transmastoid approach to address both right-sided defects simultaneously.In a patient with right-sided hyperacusis, bilateral dehiscence of both the superior and the posterior semicircular canals was identified, located adjacent to the common crus, together with a right-sided, anterosuperiorly positioned sigmoid sinus and a high-riding jugular bulb. Results for audiography and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing were consistent with right-sided semicircular canal dehiscence. At surgery, a right-sided transmastoid approach provided access to plug both defects simultaneously, following posterior mobilisation of the sigmoid sinus. The patient's hyperacusis was completely resolved, with a 10-30 dB improvement in his right ear air conduction hearing, without decrement in bone conduction.In properly selected patients, a transmastoid approach can be used to effectively manage superior semicircular canal dehiscence and posterior semicircular canal dehiscence simultaneously. Pre-operative computed tomography is recommended to evaluate the dehiscence sites and to identify complicating vascular anatomy.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480590","annotations":[{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.777963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Semicircular canal","weight":0.694475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.417653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.408823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Hyperacusis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.359417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.167861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sigmoid sinus","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_sinus"},{"name":"Superior canal dehiscence","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_canal_dehiscence"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Bone conduction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction"},{"name":"Posterior semicircular canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Superior semicircular canal","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_semicircular_canal"},{"name":"1030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1030"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Semicircle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle"},{"name":"Increment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Myogenic contraction","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenic_contraction"},{"name":"Bulb","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb"},{"name":"Conduction (heat)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_(heat)"},{"name":"Canal (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"}]}
