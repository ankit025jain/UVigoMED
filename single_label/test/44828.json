{"id":44828,"title":"Lobaplatin combined floxuridine/pirarubicin-based transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization for unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To assess the effect and safety of lobaplatin combinated floxuridine /pirarubicin in transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization(TACE) of unresectable primary liver cancer.TACE combined with the chemotherapy regimen was used to treat 34 unresectable primary liver cancer patients. DSA/ MRI/CT/blood routine examinations were used to evaluate short term activity and toxicity after 4-5 weeks, the process being repeated if necessary.Among the 34 cases, 1 (2.9%) showed a complete response, 21 (61.7%) a partial response, 8 (23.5%) stable disease, and 4 progressive disease, with a total effective rate of 67.6%. The content of alpha fetoprotein dropped by over 50% in 20 cases (58.8%). The rate of recovery was hepatalgia (88.2%), ascites (47.1%), appetite (55.9%), Performance Status(30.4%). The median follow-up time (MFT) was 281 days (63-558 days), and median progression-free survival was 118.5 days (95%, CI:88.8-148.2 days). Adverse reactions (III-IV grade) were not common, with only 4 cases of vomiting and 2 cases of thrombocytopenia (III grade).Lobaplatin-based TACE is an effective and safe treatment for primary liver cancer.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716934","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Floxuridine","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floxuridine"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.449165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.444591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.41458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.302877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.209804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.142977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Digital Signature Algorithm","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"OS/360 and successors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
