{"id":18682,"title":"Extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolation among older adults: epidemiology and outcomes.","abstract":"Clinical outcomes of older and younger adults with extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolation were compared. Two hundred thirty-two older adults (aged ?65 years), and 145 younger adults with infection were identified between February 2010 and July 2011. After controlling for the propensity score and receipt of effective therapy, older adults were not at increased risk for adverse outcomes.
