{"id":18410,"title":"European enhanced surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2010: data from 26 European countries in the post-heptavalent conjugate vaccine era.","abstract":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of severe infectious diseases worldwide. This paper presents the results from the first European invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) enhanced surveillance where additional and valuable data were reported and analysed. Following its authorisation in Europe in 2001 for use in children aged between two months and five years, the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was progressively introduced in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries, albeit with different schemes and policies. In mid-2010 European countries started to switch to a higher valency vaccine (PCV10/PCV13), still without a significant impact by the time of this surveillance. Therefore, this surveillance provides an overview of baseline data from the transition period between the introduction of PCV7 and the implementation of PCV10/PCV13. In 2010, 26 EU/EEA countries reported 21 565 cases of IPD to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) applying the EU 2008 case definition. Serotype was determined in 9946/21565 (46.1%) cases. The most common serotypes were 19A, 1, 7F, 3, 14, 22F, 8, 4, 12F and 19F, accounting for 5949/9946 (59.8%) of the serotyped isolates. Data on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) in the form of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were submitted for penicillin 5384/21565 (25.0%), erythromycin 4031/21565 (18.7%) and cefotaxime 5252/21565 (24.4%). Non-susceptibility to erythromycin was highest at 17.6% followed by penicillin at 8.9%. PCV7 serotype coverage among children <5 years in Europe, was 19.2%; for the same age group, the serotype coverage for PCV10 and PCV13 were 46.1% and 73.1%, respectively. In the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the monitoring of changing trends in antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution are essential in assessing the impact of vaccines and antibiotic use control programmes across European countries.
