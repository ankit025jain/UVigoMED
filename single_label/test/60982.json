{"id":60982,"title":"Radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"The long-term cardiac complications of radio(chemo)therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma include coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, valvular disease, pericardial disease, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The extent of myocardial damage after radiotherapy is dependent on the dose, the volume and the technique of chest irradiation. Also, patient-specific factors, such as the age of the patient at the time of treatment and the presence of classical cardiac risk factors are supposed to be important. The relative risk of cardiovascular events is estimated to be 2 to 7 times higher than the general population. The patient's clinical picture can vary from asymptomatic to an acute presentation of end-stage coronary artery or valvular disease.","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783474","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.837165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.796195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.769861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.564734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.543831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.474772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Constrictive pericarditis","weight":0.429793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrictive_pericarditis"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.250882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.136268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
