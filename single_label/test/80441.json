{"id":80441,"title":"[The prevalence of Dicrocoeliid (Trematoda: Digenea) larval stages in Helix lucorum Linneus 1758 (Mollusca: Pulmonata) in the vicinity of Kastamonu].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Dicrocoeliid larval stages in Helix lucorum Linnaeus, 1758 (Mollusca: Pulmonata) living in the vicinity of Kastamonu.Snails were collected in the vicinity of Ta?köprü, Kastamonu in March, April, May 2013. They were dissected while alive and their hepatopankreas were removed and placed on clean glass slide with a drop of 0.6% NaCl solution. The hepatopankreas were incised with a mounted needle and a thin film of the hepatopankreas fluid was drown out on a slide for examination of live parasites. After examination, larval stages fixed in %70 alcohol, formaldehyde-ethyl alcohol, 10% formalin and bouin.H. lucorum which is a land snail species has been reported for the first time being an intermediate host in the life cycle of Dicrocoeliid (Trematoda: Digenea) species with the prevalence of 27.6% from our country. Morphological and histological features of larval stages were determined.H. lucorum is an intermediate host in the life cycle of Dicrocoeliid species. The prevalence of infection was highest in April. This land snail species is important for the health of animal and human.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659700","annotations":[{"name":"Intermediate host","weight":0.848396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_host"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Mollusca","weight":0.816901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Carl Linnaeus","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Trematoda","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Digenea","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digenea"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.338922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Pulmonata","weight":0.337407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonata"},{"name":"Land snail","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_snail"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Systema Naturae","weight":0.122719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Drowning","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Helix lucorum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_lucorum"},{"name":"Thin film","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_film"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Sewing needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing_needle"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
