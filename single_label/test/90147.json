{"id":90147,"title":"[Instability and other local complications after revision hip replacement in one patient--a case report].","abstract":"Arthroplasty of the hip is now considered as a safe procedure. The most frequent complications include such terms as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and thrombosis locally at the lower extremities, wound infection, loosening of the implant, periprosthetic fracture, dislocation of the prosthesis or sciatic nerve injury. The work is described for patient operated at the Department of Orthopaedics WIM, in which within 3 years from revision surgery made of loosening of the implants there were multiple complications, including multiple prosthetic dislocations, periprosthetic fracture, nonunion and damage of the stabilizing plate. During this period, the present 73-year old woman were seven treatments, including three closed repositions dislocated prosthesis. Treatment was discontinued in February 2012 stating union at the pseudarthrosis.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645575","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.774202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.73549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.699351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.672465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.562923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.417127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.127312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Pseudarthrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudarthrosis"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"}]}
