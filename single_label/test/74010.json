{"id":74010,"title":"Epidemiology of basal cell carcinoma in the United Kingdom: incidence, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities.","abstract":"Little is known about the epidemiology of basal cell carcinoma (BCC).Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we calculated annual incidence rates. In a case-control analysis, we examined lifestyle factors and comorbidities.Incidence rose significantly between 2000 and 2011. Basal cell carcinoma risk was increased in alcohol drinkers (slightly) and immunocompromised patients, but reduced in smokers and individuals with abnormal weight.Basal cell carcinoma places a growing public health burden. Lifestyle factors do not play a major role in pathogenesis, but immunosuppression is important.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874476","annotations":[{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.900917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.798387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Basal-cell carcinoma","weight":0.543719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.307366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Data link","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link"},{"name":"Practice research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_research"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
