{"id":2936,"title":"Prohepcidin in maternal circulation: is it related to spontaneous preterm labor?","abstract":"To investigate whether spontaneous preterm labor (PTL) with intact membranes is associated with changes in maternal serum prohepcidin concentrations.The study consisted of patients with spontaneous PTL with intact membranes (n = 25), a control group of healthy pregnant women between the 24th and 37th gestational weeks (n = 22), and uncomplicated term pregnancies in spontaneous labor (n = 19). Blood samples were collected from patients at the time of clinical diagnosis. Levels of prohepcidin, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, serum iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity, total iron binding capacity, transferrin and transferrin saturation, C reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were measured.Patients with spontaneous PTL had significantly lower maternal serum prohepcidin concentrations than term delivery and control subjects.Maternal serum prohepcidin concentration is lower in patients with spontaneous PTL compared to term delivery and control subjects. This suggests that measuring maternal serum prohepcidin concentrations in PTL may be a feasible method for understanding etiologic causes of spontaneous preterm delivery, but, before suggesting this as a course of action, low levels of prohepcidin in patients with PTL need to be more fully investigated.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552169","annotations":[{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.859022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.720698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.713397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.644004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.407595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.32596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.304947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.279711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.261252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Serum iron","weight":0.133226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_iron"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Total iron-binding capacity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_iron-binding_capacity"},{"name":"Transferrin saturation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin_saturation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0187256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"}]}
