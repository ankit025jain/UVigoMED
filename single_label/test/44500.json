{"id":44500,"title":"Down-regulation of miR-141 induced by helicobacter pylori promotes the invasion of gastric cancer by targeting STAT4.","abstract":"The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer has been identified recently. However, the molecular mechanism remained largely unknown.We found that miR-141 was decreased in Helicobacter pylori positive specimens (n=75) compared with negative tissues (n=75). The knockdown of miR-141 enhanced the invasion ability of gastric cancer cells; meanwhile, over-expression of miR-141 could inhibit the abilities of gastric cancer cells in vitro. A luciferase assay revealed that miR-141 was directly bound to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of STAT4. STAT4 was found up-regulated at mRNA and protein levels, as shown by qRT-PCR and western blot. Over-expression of STAT4 was used to mimic miR-141 action in the invasion of gastric cancer.MiR-141 may play a pivotal role in controlling gastric cancer invasion through regulating STAT4 and maybe a potential target to treat gastric cancer.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732377","annotations":[{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.946214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.741171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.621206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.589794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.223177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.185466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"STAT4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT4"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
