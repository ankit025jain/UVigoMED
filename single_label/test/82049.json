{"id":82049,"title":"A three-species biofilm model for the evaluation of enamel and dentin demineralization.","abstract":"Although Streptococcus mutans biofilms have been useful for evaluating the cariogenic potential of dietary carbohydrates and the effects of fluoride on dental demineralization, a more appropriate biofilm should be developed to demonstrate the influence of other oral bacteria on cariogenic biofilms. This study describes the development and validation of a three-species biofilm model comprising Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus gordonii for the evaluation of enamel and dentin demineralization after cariogenic challenges and fluoride exposure. Single- or three-species biofilms were developed on dental substrata for 96 h, and biofilms were exposed to feast and famine episodes. The three-species biofilm model produced a large biomass, mostly comprising S. mutans (41%) and S. gordonii (44%), and produced significant demineralization in the dental substrata, although enamel demineralization was decreased by fluoride treatment. The findings indicate that the three-species biofilm model may be useful for evaluating the cariogenic potential of dietary carbohydrates other than sucrose and determining the effects of fluoride on dental substrata.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730462","annotations":[{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Streptococcus mutans","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.810259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.472954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Famine","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"},{"name":"Actinomyces","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinomyces"},{"name":"Biomass","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"}]}
