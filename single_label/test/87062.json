{"id":87062,"title":"First-line antiretroviral therapy with nevirapine versus lopinavir-ritonavir based regimens in a resource-limited setting.","abstract":"To compare WHO first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-based regimen with a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) regimen in a resource-limited setting regarding treatment outcome and emergence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs).Treatment-naive adults were randomized to nevirapine (NVP) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) regimens each in combination with tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) or zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC). Primary endpoint was the incidence of therapeutical (clinical and/or virologic) failure at week 48 with follow-up till week 96.Four hundred and twenty-five patients (120 men; 305 women) received at least one dose of the study drug. mITT analysis showed no difference in proportion of therapeutical failure between treatment arms [67/209 (32%) in NVP vs. 63/216 (29%) LPV/r at week 48 (P?=?0.53); 88/209 (42%) in NVP vs. 83/216 (38%) in LPV/r at week 96 (P?=?0.49)]. Per-protocol analysis demonstrated significantly more virologic failure with NVP than with LPV/r regimens [at week 48: 19/167 (11%) vs. 7/166 (4%), P?=?0.014; at week 96: 27/158 (17%) vs. 13/159 (8%), P?=? 0.019)]. Drug resistance mutations to NNRTI were detected in 19 out of 22 (86.3%) and dual-class resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and NNRTI in 15 out of 27 (68.2%) of NVP failing patients. K65R mutation was present in seven out of 14 patients failing NVP-TDF/FTC regimen. No major protease inhibitor-DRM was detected among LPV/r failing patients. Discontinuation for adverse events was similar between treatment groups.In resource-limited settings, first-line NNRTI-NRTI regimen as compared with bPI-based regimen provides similar outcome but is associated with a significantly higher number of virologic failure and resistance mutations in both classes that jeopardize future options for second-line therapy.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028911","annotations":[{"name":"Lopinavir","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopinavir"},{"name":"Zidovudine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine"},{"name":"Tenofovir","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir"},{"name":"Nevirapine","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevirapine"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-transcriptase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.796422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.712148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.591096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.472668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Federal Trade Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
