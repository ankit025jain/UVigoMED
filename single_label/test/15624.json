{"id":15624,"title":"[Study on the safety and efficacy of sitafloxacin at a dose of 100 mg once a day--results of the use-results survey].","abstract":"Sitafloxacin (STFX, Gracevit 50 mg, fine granules 10%), an oral quinolone antibacterial agent, was approved additionally for administration at a dose of 100 mg once a day in August 2011. A use-results survey on STFX 100 mg/day was performed from December 2011 to May 2013. In total, 1,186 case cards were collected from 226 medical institutions and 1,089 cases were subjected to a safety evaluation and 1,069 were subjected to an efficacy evaluation. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 2.11% (23/1,089 cases) and no serious ADRs were observed. The major ADR was diarrhea at 1.10% (12/1,089 cases). Of these 12 cases, 10 cases developed symptoms within 4 days of treatment. All of them, except one case that could not be followed up, either recovered or improved. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs of the phenyl acetate and propionate types, which require caution when coadministered with STFX, were used concomitantly by 17.6% (192/1,089 cases) of patients but no central nervous system ADRs were observed. The overall efficacy rate was 96.4% (1,030/1,069 cases) and by types of infections, it was 97.0% (387/399 cases) for respiratory tract infections, 96.7% (353/365 cases) for urinary tract infections, 94.7% (36/38 cases) for gynecological infections, 92.3% (132/143 cases) for otorhinolaryngological infections, 98.4% (122/124 cases) for dental and oral surgical infections. The efficacy rate in every category of site of infection exceeded 90%. The overall eradication rate was 94.4% (185/196 strains) including Gram-positive bacteria at 95.4% (62/65 strains), Gram-negative bacteria at 92.2% (94/102 strains), anaerobes at 100.0% (11/11 strains) and atypical bacteria at 100.0% (18/18 strains). In conclusion, this use-results survey confirmed that STFX 100 mg/day is an effective administration with no serious problems in its safety profile and efficacy rate of over 90% in every category of site of infection.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163251","annotations":[{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Antiseptic","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.748303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.625063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.582941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.531469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.441668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.359386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.193022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Propanoic acid","weight":0.0344035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propanoic_acid"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fine motor skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill"}]}
