{"id":65674,"title":"[Abiraterone acetate (AA): current guidelines of prescription of abiraterone].","abstract":"Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a selective inhibitor of cytochrom p450 (CYP)17 which is required for androgen biosynthesis, and can block the androgens synthesis by testicles, surrenals and intratumoral secretion. In phase I and II studies in patients with prostate cancer, therapy with AA 250-2000 ?mg once daily demonstrated reductions in prostate specific antigen (PSA), and/or circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In two large phase III trials in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in post-docetaxel and pre-docetaxel setting, AA plus prednisone compared with placebo plus prednisone demonstrated a significant superior overall survival in post-docetaxel setting, and a superior radiological PFS in pre-docetaxel setting. Based of these results, AA is approved in metastatic CRPC patients in post-docetaxel setting or pre-docetaxel setting in 2013.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793632","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"CYP17A1","weight":0.691038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP17A1"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.592859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.469971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Abiraterone","weight":0.378789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiraterone"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.335087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
