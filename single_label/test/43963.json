{"id":43963,"title":"Role of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase down-regulation on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"The role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the modulation of cell growth is well established in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to elucidate the significance of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) down-regulation on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.The expression of 15-PGDH in HCC cell lines and resected HCC tissues was investigated, and the correlation between 15-PGDH expression and HCC cell-line proliferation and patient survival was explored.The interleukin-1-?-induced suppression of 15-PGDH did not change the proliferation of PLC and Huh-7 cells in the MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. The induction of 15-PGDH by transfection in HepG2 cells without baseline 15-PGDH expression was suppressed at day 2 of proliferation compared with empty-vector transfection, but there was no difference at day 3. Among the 153 patients who received curative HCC resection between 2003 and 2004 at our institution, 15-PGDH expression was observed in resected HCC tissues in 56 (36.6%), but the 5-year survival rate did not differ from that of the remaining 97 non-15-PGDH-expressing patients (57.1% vs 59.8%; P=0.93). Among 50 patients who exhibited baseline 15-PGDH expression in adjacent nontumor liver tissues, 28 (56%) exhibited a reduction in 15-PGDH expression score in HCC tissues, and there was a trend toward fewer long-term survivors compared with the remaining 22 with the same or increment in their 15-PGDH expression score in HCC tissues.The prognostic significance of 15-PGDH down-regulation in HCC was not established in this study. However, maintenance of 15-PGDH expression could be a potential therapeutic target for a subgroup of HCC patients with baseline 15-PGDH expression in adjacent nontumor liver tissue.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757656","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.894125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.788482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.68083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.627961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.414288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.187826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.119821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hep G2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep_G2"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Huh (god)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huh_(god)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"},{"name":"Phospholipase C","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C"}]}
