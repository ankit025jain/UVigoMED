{"id":9264,"title":"Experimental infection of dogs with H6N1 avian influenza A virus.","abstract":"H6N1 avian influenza A viruses, which have spread across North America, Europe and Asia, have been shown to be infectious not only for birds but also for mammals. Because humans lack immunity to H6N1 avian influenza A viruses, the emergence of these viruses in humans would probably cause a pandemic. Replication of H6N1 avian influenza A viruses in dogs may facilitate their adaptation in humans because dogs are often in close contact with humans. However, the susceptibility of dogs to these viruses is unknown. To address this question, we infected beagles intranasally (i.n.) with an H6N1 avian influenza A virus that was isolated from a mallard. Inoculation of this virus into beagles resulted in the virus being detectable in the lung and seroconversion with no clinical signs except for a fever at 1Â day post-inoculation (dpi). In addition, the virus was transiently shed from the nose and in the feces of the infected beagles. Our results suggest that dogs can be subclinically infected with H6N1 avian influenza A viruses, which, like H7N9, have low pathogenicity in birds and may serve as an intermediate host to transfer this virus to humans. Certain actions may be taken to prevent the potential transmission of these viruses, including the development of H6N1 avian influenza vaccines for prevention.
