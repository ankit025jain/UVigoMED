{"id":24025,"title":"Small RNAs in the Vibrionaceae: an ocean still to be explored.","abstract":"In bacteria, the discovery of noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) as modulators of gene expression in response to environmental signals has brought new insights into bacterial gene regulation, including control of pathogenicity. The Vibrionaceae constitute a family of marine bacteria of which many are responsible for infections affecting not only humans, such as Vibrio cholerae but also fish and marine invertebrates, representing the major cause of mortality in farmed marine species. They are able to colonize many habitats, existing as planktonic forms, in biofilms or associated with various hosts. This high adaptability is linked to their capacity to generate genetic diversity, in part through lateral gene transfer, but also by varying gene expression control. In the recent years, several major studies have illustrated the importance of small regulatory sRNAs in the Vibrionaceae for the control of pathogenicity and adaptation to environment and nutrient sources such as chitin, especially in V. cholerae and Vibrio harveyi. The existence of a complex regulatory network controlled by quorum sensing has been demonstrated in which sRNAs play central roles. This review covers major advances made in the discovery and elucidation of functions of Vibrionaceae sRNAs within the last 10?years.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458378","annotations":[{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.931221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Quorum sensing","weight":0.92504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_sensing"},{"name":"Chitin","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Ocean","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Plankton","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Invertebrate","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Marine (ocean)","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.615743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Marine biology","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.56593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.542944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.333652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.326206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Systems biology","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology"},{"name":"Fish farming","weight":0.213223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.198926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Vibrio harveyi","weight":0.136923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_harveyi"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.133733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Marine invertebrates","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_invertebrates"}]}
