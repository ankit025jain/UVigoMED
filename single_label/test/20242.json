{"id":20242,"title":"Are we justified in treating for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis based on positive follow-up smear results?","abstract":"National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, India.To assess, among new culture-confirmed smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients, the proportion of follow-up smear-positives that were culture-negative (S+C-) by month of follow-up examination, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, pre-treatment drug susceptibility status and smear grading.We extracted follow-up smear (fluorescence microscopy) and culture (LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen) results of patients enrolled in clinical trials from January 2000 to August 2012 and treated with the WHO Category I regimen (2EHRZ3/4HR3).Of 520 patients, including 176 who were HIV-infected, respectively 199, 81, 47 and 43 were smear-positive at months 2, 4, 5 and 6; of these, respectively 138 (69%), 62 (75%), 32 (68%) and 27 (63%) were culture-negative. The S+C- phenomenon was more pronounced among '1+ positive' patients than in 2+ or 3+ positive patients and in 'pan-susceptible' patients than in those with any resistance, and did not vary by HIV status.Nearly two thirds of patients with follow-up smears positive at months 5 and 6 were culture-negative. Starting multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) treatment empirically based on smear results, even in resource-limited settings, is incorrect and can have hazardous consequences. There is an urgent need to revisit the WHO recommendation concerning empirical MDR-TB treatment.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670701","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.802861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"India","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.616953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.527169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.482132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.170686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Empiricism","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Evidence-based practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_practice"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
