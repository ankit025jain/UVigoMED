{"id":61325,"title":"MDM2 rs2279744 and TP53 rs1042522 polymorphisms associated with etoposide- and cisplatin-induced grade III/IV neutropenia in Chinese extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer patients.","abstract":"Etoposide and cisplatin (EP) chemotherapy is the most frequently used regimen in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients, although the side effects (e.g., neutropenia) are high. This study investigates the association of the MDM2 rs2279744 and TP53 rs1042522 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with EP-induced grade III/IV neutropenia and with response to EP in extensive-stage SCLC patients.Blood samples from 119 extensive-stage SCLC patients were subjected to genotyping of these 2 SNPs, using the allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for determining the association with neutropenia in the patients.The data showed that patients carrying the MDM2 rs2279744-GG genotype were associated with a lower incidence of grade III/IV neutropenia in the recessive and additive models, while the TP53 rs1042522-CC genotype was associated with a higher incidence in the recessive model. Furthermore, the combination of the MDM2 rs2279744-TT+TG and the TP53 rs1042522-CC genotype was associated with a significantly higher incidence of grade III/IV neutropenia. And the combination of the MDM2 rs2279744-GG and the TP53 rs1042522-GG+GC genotype was associated with the lowest incidence of grade III/IV neutropenia.MDM2 rs2279744 and TP53 rs1042522 SNPs were associated with EP-induced high-grade neutropenia in extensive-stage SCLC patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732641","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.825118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.703174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.669436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.619301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.572845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.48835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.263582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"China","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Southern Christian Leadership Conference","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference"},{"name":"Mdm2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdm2"},{"name":"Extended play","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Township (Canada)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township_(Canada)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Desorption","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desorption"}]}
