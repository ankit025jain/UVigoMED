{"id":41738,"title":"Management of Budd-Chiari: a single-center experience of 280 cases.","abstract":"Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare and life-threatening disorder secondary to hepatic venous outflow obstruction. How to manage this complex disease has haunted many surgeons. The aim of this study is to investigate the treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome in our hospital.The clinical data of 280 BCS patients were analyzed retrospectively in our hospital between July 2000 and March 2013.The total effective rate was 90% (252/280). The rate of mortality was 7.14% (20/280), the rate of complication was 17.14% (48/280). We carried out followup in 198 cases from 6 months to 10 years, the rate of recurrence was 6.07% (12/198).Treatment of BCS need to get a corrective diagnosis and classification at first, then select corrective methods of treatment based on different pathological change of IVC and main hepatic vein.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901162","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.69265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.535711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.13109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.0204144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Bowl Championship Series","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series"}]}
