{"id":61384,"title":"[Current status of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for malignant lymphoma].","abstract":"The roles of high-dose chemotherapy/chemo-radiotherapy with either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell supports in the treatment lymphoma continue to change. Introduction of molecular targeting agents and other new drugs to the standard chemotherapy have improved the treatment outcome significantly, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is not currently used as part of first-line therapy. As opposed to this, autologous HSCT are widely used for the treatment of relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Allogeneic HSCT is also increasingly being considered. However, the outcome of HSCT in relapsed/refractory lymphoma remains unsatisfactory, and a variety of molecular targeting approaches are currently being incorporated in order to improve the outcome of HSCT for lymphoma.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724407","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.802861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.651766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.57037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
