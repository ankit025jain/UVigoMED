{"id":55876,"title":"A single injection of intravitreal ranibizumab in the treatment of choroidal neovascularisation secondary to optic nerve head drusen in a child.","abstract":"Optic nerve head drusen are acellular, calcified deposits which may be found in buried or exposed drusen form. Choroidal neovascularisation secondary to optic nerve head drusen is rarely seen in childhood. This case report summarises the clinical and therapeutic outcomes of a 13-year-old girl with unilateral choroidal neovascularisation secondary to optic nerve head drusen. The patient was successfully treated with a single intravitreal ranibizumab injection. After a month from the injection the visual acuity increased dramatically and maintained at the same level during 9 months of follow-up time. There was no complication related to the injection.
