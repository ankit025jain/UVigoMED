{"id":55175,"title":"Development of a cell-based assay for the detection of anti-aquaporin 1 antibodies in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.","abstract":"To develop a cell-based assay (CBA) to detect aquaporin 1 (AQP1) antibodies and determine sensitivity/specificity in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders.A HEK-293T transfected cell model expressing AQP1 was established and detected to be serum AQP1 antibodies.AQP1 antibodies were present in 73/98 (74.5%) AQP4 antibody-positive patients. Some AQP4 antibody-negative patients were also AQP1 antibody-positive. Test sensitivity was 74.5% in 98 AQP4 antibody-positive patients. Test specificity was 79.6% in 67 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 31 controls.A sensitive and simple CBA was developed to detect serum AQP1 antibodies. AQP1 antibodies were mainly present in NMO and its high-risk syndrome, but also in some MS patients.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972850","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.907611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.721359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Neuromyelitis optica","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromyelitis_optica"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.495077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Aquaporin","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Aquaporin 4","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin_4"},{"name":"HEK cell","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEK_cell"},{"name":"Continental Basketball Association","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association"},{"name":"Aquaporin 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin_1"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"}]}
