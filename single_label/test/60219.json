{"id":60219,"title":"Effect of intra-articular injection of tranexamic acid on postoperative hemoglobin in total hip arthroplasty.","abstract":"Postoperative anemia is a significant risk factor in total hip arthroplasty, leading to increased length of hospital stay and delayed mobility and rehabilitation, and is poorly tolerated by patients with peripheral vascular and cardiovascular disease. Intravenous tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic drug, has been shown to reduce postoperative anemia in total joint replacement. Intra-articular administration eliminates the risk of systemic effects, the most concerning of which is thrombosis. Although this method of administering tranexamic acid has been studied in total knee replacement, currently no literature has been published on its efficacy in primary total hip replacement. The purpose of this study was to examine postoperative hemoglobin decrease and the transfusion rate following intra-articular tranexamic acid administration in primary total hip arthroplasty. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 181 consecutive total hip replacements, 91 of which received tranexamic acid. No statistical significance was found between these groups in any of the demographic variables. Postoperative hemoglobin decrease in the control group was 4.4±1.0 g/dL compared with a decrease of 3.6±1.1 g/dL in the tranexamic group, demonstrating an 18% reduction in blood loss (P<.001). No significant difference was found between the number of patients transfused (P=.777) or the number of units used (P=.993). No clotting events were seen in either group. Overall, the study demonstrates that intra-articular tranexamic acid in primary total hip arthroplasty is associated with a significant improvement in postoperative hemoglobin decrease without systemic hypercoagulability.
