{"id":33706,"title":"Creatine prevents the imbalance of redox homeostasis caused by homocysteine in skeletal muscle of rats.","abstract":"Homocystinuria is a neurometabolic disease caused by severe deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase activity, resulting in severe hyperhomocysteinemia. Affected patients present several symptoms including a variable degree of motor dysfunction, being that the pathomechanism is not fully understood. In the present study we investigated the effect of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia on some parameters of oxidative stress, namely 2'7'dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation, levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT and GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), total sulfhydryl and carbonyl content, as well as nitrite levels in soleus skeletal muscle of young rats subjected to model of severe hyperhomocysteinemia. We also evaluated the effect of creatine on biochemical alterations elicited by hyperhomocysteinemia. Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous injection of homocysteine (0.3-0.6 ?mol/g body weight), and/or creatine (50mg/kg body weight) from their 6th to the 28th days age. Controls and treated rats were decapitated at 12h after the last injection. Chronic homocysteine administration increased 2'7'dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation, an index of production of reactive species and TBARS levels, an index of lipoperoxidation. Antioxidant enzyme activities, such as SOD and CAT were also increased, but GPx activity was not altered. The content of GSH, sulfhydril and carbonyl were decreased, as well as levels of nitrite. Creatine concurrent administration prevented some homocysteine effects probably by its antioxidant properties. Our data suggest that the oxidative insult elicited by chronic hyperhomocystenemia may provide insights into the mechanisms by which homocysteine exerts its effects on skeletal muscle function. Creatine prevents some alterations caused by homocysteine.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797612","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Homocystinuria","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocystinuria"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.762328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.752993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Carbonyl","weight":0.667453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.657951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nitrite","weight":0.552292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.451202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Hyperhomocysteinemia","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhomocysteinemia"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.323263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.24882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.227016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Cystathionine","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystathionine"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.114344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Soleus muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soleus_muscle"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Decapitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation"},{"name":"Tardive dyskinesia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
