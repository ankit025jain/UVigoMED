{"id":90938,"title":"Glycan-dependent binding of galectin-1 to neuropilin-1 promotes axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury.","abstract":"Following spinal cord injury (SCI), semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) prevents axonal regeneration through binding to the neuropilin-1 (NRP-1)/PlexinA4 receptor complex. Here, we show that galectin-1 (Gal-1), an endogenous glycan-binding protein, selectively bound to the NRP-1/PlexinA4 receptor complex in injured neurons through a glycan-dependent mechanism, interrupts the Sema3A pathway and contributes to axonal regeneration and locomotor recovery after SCI. Although both Gal-1 and its monomeric variant contribute to de-activation of microglia, only high concentrations of wild-type Gal-1 (which co-exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium) bind to the NRP-1/PlexinA4 receptor complex and promote axonal regeneration. Our results show that Gal-1, mainly in its dimeric form, promotes functional recovery of spinal lesions by interfering with inhibitory signals triggered by Sema3A binding to NRP-1/PlexinA4 complex, supporting the use of this lectin for the treatment of SCI patients.
