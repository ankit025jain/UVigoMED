{"id":88571,"title":"[Treatment of flexion-distraction thoracolumbar fractures by postural reduction with instrumental reduction].","abstract":"To study the curative effect of postural reduction with instrumental reduction in treatment of flexion-distraction thoracolumbar fractures.A retrospective study was performed on 43 patients with single thoracolumbar flexion-distraction fractures admitted from August 2009 to August 2011, included 28 males and 15 females with an average age of 44 years old (34 to 56 years old). All patients were treated with postural reduction with instrumental reduction. The kyphosis (Cobb angle) recovery of injured vertebral height and complication were analyzed. The visual analogue scale(VAS) and com-plications were followed up and recorded.There was no difference in recovery of injured vertebral posterior height among preoperative, 1 week and 1 year after operation (P > 0.05). There were significantly difference in kyphosis (Cobb angle) and recovery of injured vertebral anterior height between preoperative and postoperative at 1 week (P < 0.05). There was no difference in kyphosis (Cobb angle) and recovery of injured vertebral anterior height between 1 week and 1 year after operation (P > 0.05). VAS significantly improved from preoperative (7.2 +/- 1.2) to (0.8 +/- 0.7) at 1 year after operation (t = 18.47, P < 0.001).Postural reduction with instrumental reduction is effective for thoracolumbar flexion-distraction fractures and it is beneficial to the recovery of vertebral height and saggital alignment.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826480","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.156848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Cobb angle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_angle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0173619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Instrumental","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"}]}
