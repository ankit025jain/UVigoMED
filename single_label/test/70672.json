{"id":70672,"title":"Individual counseling is the preferred treatment for depression in breast cancer survivors.","abstract":"A substantial number of cancer patients experience depression. This study investigated treatment preferences for depression. Breast cancer survivors (N = 134) completed an anonymous survey asking preference and interest in three treatments for depression: individual counseling (IC), antidepressant medication (MED), or support groups (SG). Participants were recruited from a surgical oncology office and asked to complete the survey as they waited for their appointment. Preference was compared using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests. More than 50% ranked IC as first choice of treatment. Preference for IC was significantly higher than preference for MED and SG. Preference between MED and SG did not differ. Survivors prefered counseling for treatment of depression. Cancer centers should be prepared to provide preferred treatment methods, particulary as screening, and therefore management, of psychosocial distress is to be required.
