{"id":86573,"title":"Intramedullary thoracic spinal metastasis from small-cell lung cancer.","abstract":"Lung cancer with intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM) is a rare event exhibiting dismal prognosis. In the present paper, we describe a 74-year-old male who developed bilateral leg weakness with associated backache and non-productive cough. Chest imaging evaluation demonstrated pronounced bilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a nodular opacity in the right lower lobe. The patient was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer through bronchoscopic procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord with contrast-enhancement revealed an intramedullary lesion consistent with metastasis at the T5-T6 level. Despite chemotherapy and thoracic spine radiotherapy, he eventually succumbed to the disease 3 months after diagnosis. A brief overview of the current literature is also provided laying emphasis on the therapeutic strategies of this unusual extrathoracic metastatic disease.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761534","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Small-cell carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.731065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.579123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.444527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.413514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.31697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.245157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Bilateral symmetry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
