{"id":90912,"title":"Effect of surgical approach on the early outcome of total hip replacement for femoral neck fractures.","abstract":"We reviewed the short-term outcome of 171 patients treated with total hip replacement for femoral neck fractures using the lateral (94 patients) or posterior approach (77 patients). The Sernbo score and the Abbreviated Mental Test Score were used to assess patients' pre-injury functional and cognitive status respectively. Patients were uniformly treated with regard to the type of prosthesis, size of femoral head and rehabilitation. They were followed up to a mean of 25 months (range : 13-42 months). The dislocation rate in the lateral group was 2.1% versus 0% in the posterior group. There was no difference with regards to leg length discrepancy and the restoration of medial offset. Our results were attributed the standardised patients' selection and adequate soft tissue repair.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563972","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.599889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.558217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.544854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.355432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.258387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.0932836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Lateral aortic lymph nodes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_aortic_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Unequal leg length","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_leg_length"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"1342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1342"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Abbreviation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0136018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"}]}
