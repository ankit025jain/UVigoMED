{"id":22269,"title":"Colistin/daptomycin: an unconventional antimicrobial combination synergistic in vitro against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.","abstract":"The in vitro activity of the combination colistin/daptomycin was evaluated against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. Clonal relationships were assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The following synergy studies were undertaken: (i) daptomycin MICs were determined by E-test on Mueller-Hinton agar plates supplemented with a subinhibitory concentration of colistin; and (ii) time-kill methodology using tubes containing an inoculum of 5Ã—10(5)CFU/mL and subinhibitory concentrations of each antibiotic alone or in combination subcultured at 0, 5 and 24h for colony counting. Synergy was defined as ?2log10CFU/mL decrease of viable colonies compared with colistin alone. Ten colistin-susceptible and four colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates were tested. Isolates were assigned to nine different clonal types. Enhanced in vitro activity of the combination was detected only against colistin-susceptible isolates; using plates supplemented with colistin, the daptomycin MIC was reduced by 4- to 128-fold. From a total of 30 isolate-concentration combinations in time-kill studies, a synergistic interaction was detected in 16 (53.3%). The combination exhibited synergy against 8 and 12 of these combinations at 5h and 24h, respectively. No antagonism was detected. Colistin alone was bactericidal against two colistin-susceptible isolates at 24h, whereas the combination was bactericidal against 9 colistin-susceptible isolates at 24h. Against all colistin-resistant isolates, the combination exhibited a static effect and indifference in time-kill studies. Potent in vitro synergistic interactions between colistin and daptomycin provide evidence that this unorthodox combination may be beneficial in the treatment of colistin-susceptible multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.
