{"id":25559,"title":"Successful robot-assisted repair of congenital mitral valve regurgitation.","abstract":"Congenital mitral valve regurgitation (CMR) is very uncommon in adults and is usually associated with other congenital malformations. Repair of the mitral valve remains the standard of care. Very limited reports are available on minimally invasive surgical approaches in treating CMR. This report represents the first case series of the successful application of robotics in correcting CMR and associated anomalies, including a partial atrioventricular canal defect.
