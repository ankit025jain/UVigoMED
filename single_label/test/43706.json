{"id":43706,"title":"[Gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with duodenogastroesophageal reflux in patients with biliary pathology: the specific features of the course and esophagogastroduodenal microbial biocenosis].","abstract":"To study the specific features of the clinical course of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) associated with duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) in patients with chronic acalculous cholecystitis (CAC) and cholelithiasis (CL), as well as qualitative and quantitative characteristics.The clinical, morphological, motor tonic characteristics of the esophagogastroduodenal area, mucosal microbial biocenosis in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were studied in detail in 83 patients with GERD that was associated with DGER and ran concurrently with CAC or CL.Impaired duodenal propulsive activity as a concomitance of the signs of gastrostasis and duodenal dyskinesia with dyscoordination of both anthroduodenal and duodenojejunal propulsion and with the development of duodenogastric reflux and DGER, which in turn determine esophageal and gastric pH values is shown to be of importance in CAC and CL, which match GERD. Abnormal microbiocenosis in the upper digestive tract is characterized by the higher quantitative and qualitative content of the mucous microflora. Opportunistic microorganisms exhibit cytotoxic, hemolytic, lecithinase, caseinolytic, urease, and RNAase activities.The found specific features of the course of GERD associated with DGER in patients with biliary tract abnormalities lead us to search for novel therapeutic approaches based on the correction of digestive motor tonic disorders and abnormal microbiocenoses of the mucous flora in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772502","annotations":[{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.844232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.778725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.773426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Biliary tract","weight":0.650522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_tract"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.630477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Ribonuclease","weight":0.530621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonuclease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.276948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.250655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Prokinetic agent","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokinetic_agent"}]}
