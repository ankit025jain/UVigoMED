{"id":82043,"title":"Comparison of BMI, AHI, and apolipoprotein E ?4 (APOE-?4) alleles among sleep apnea patients with different skeletal classifications.","abstract":"This case-control study investigated whether variations within the APOE-? gene were associated with having a convex facial profile (skeletal Class II) compared to exhibiting a straight or concave facial profile (Class I or Class III) among patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Associations between the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and body mass index (BMI) scores for these OSA patients were also examined in the context of facial profile.OSA patients with an AHI ? 15 were recruited from a sleep clinic and classified by facial and dental occlusal relationships based on a profile facial analysis, lateral photographs, and dental examination. Saliva was collected as a source of DNA. The APOE-?1-4 allele-defining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs429358 and rs7412 were genotyped. A ?(2) analysis was used to assess Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and for association analysis (significance at p < 0.05). ANOVA and Fisher exact test were also used.Seventy-six Caucasian OSA patients participated in the study-25 Class II cases and 51 non-Class II cases. There was no association of the APOE-?4 allele with facial profile among these OSA patients. Class II OSA patients had significantly lower BMIs (30.7 ± 5.78) than Class I (37.3 ± 6.14) or Class III (37.8 ± 6.17) patients (p < 0.001), although there was no statistical difference in AHI for Class II patients compared with other groups.OSA patients with Class II convex profile were more likely to have a lower BMI than those in other skeletal groups. In fact 20% of them were not obese, suggesting that a Class II convex profile may influence or be associated with OSA development independent of BMI.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24733985","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.575011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.484239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.452927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.382241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.269322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.226611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.208726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"Horse care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_care"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
