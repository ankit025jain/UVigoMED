{"id":50427,"title":"The effect of age and NT-proBNP on the association of central obesity with 6-years cardiovascular mortality of middle-aged and elderly diabetic people: the population-based Casale Monferrato study.","abstract":"Among people with type 2 diabetes the relationship between central obesity and cardiovascular mortality has not been definitely assessed. Moreover, NT-proBNP is negatively associated with central obesity, but no study has examined their combined effect on survival. We have examined these issues in a well-characterized population-based cohort.Survival data of 2272 diabetic people recruited in 2000 who had no other chronic disease have been updated to 31 December 2006. NT-proBNP was measured in a subgroup of 1690 patients. Cox proportional hazards modeling was employed to estimate the independent associations between cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and waist circumference. Mean age was 67.9 years, 49.3% were men. Both age and NT-proBNP were negatively correlated with waist circumference (r?=?-0.11, p<0.001 and r?=?-0.07, p?=?0.002). Out of 2272 subjects, 520 deaths (221 for CV mortality) occurred during a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Central obesity was not associated with CV mortality (hazard ratio, HR, adjusted for age, sex, diabetes duration, 1.14, 95% CI 0.86-1.52). NTproBNP was a negative confounder and age a strong modifier of this relationship (p for interaction<0.001): age<70 years, fully adjusted model HR?=?3.52 (1.17-10.57) and age ?70 years, HR?=?0.80 (0.46-1.40). Respective HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.86 (1.03-3.32) and 0.73 (0.51-1.04).In diabetic people aged 70 years and lower, central obesity was independently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, independently of the negative effect of NT-proBNP. In contrast, no effect on 6-years survival was evident in diabetic people who have yet survived up to 70 years.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System
