{"id":60916,"title":"[Efficacy and safety evaluation of gemcitabine combined with oxaliplatin in lymphoma patients after failure of multiple chemotherapy regimens].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine combined with oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in lymphoma patients after failure of multiple chemotherapy regimens.The clinical data of 27 lymphoma patients, who received GEMOX regimen after failure of two or more prior chemotherapy regimens, were retrospectively reviewed. The predictive factors related to the clinical efficacy of GEMOX regimen were explored.The efficacy could be evaluated in 24 patients. Complete response was obtained in 4 patients (16.7%), partial response in 7 patients (29.1%), stable disease in 6 patients (25.0%), and progressive disease in 7 patients (29.1%), with an overall response rate of 45.8%. Among the eleven CR and PR patients, four patients were with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, four patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, one with peripheral T cell lymphoma, one with mantle cell lymphoma and one with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The median PFS time of the whole group was 8 months (95%CI, 1.6-14.4 months). For 11 CR and PR patients who had response to the GEMOX regimen, the median PFS time was 19 months (95%CI, 11.1-26.8 months). Major adverse response was hematologic toxicity. Among them, grade III or IV neutropenia appeared in 16 patients (59.3%), and grade III or IV thrombocytopenia appeared in 11 patients (40.7%). The sensitivity to the last chemotherapy was related to the efficacy of GEMOX regimen. The response rate was 83.3% in patients who had response to the last chemotherapy, and only 31.2% in the patients who failed to the last chemotherapy (P = 0.001).GEMOX regimen can get a better response rate in lymphoma patients after failure of multiple chemotherapy regimens, and with a good tolerance and acceptable safety. Some patients can get long-term survival. Patients sensitive to the last chemotherapy are more likely to benefit from GEMOX regimen.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796464","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.837808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.832165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mantle cell lymphoma","weight":0.776284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"T-cell lymphoma","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.643984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.615987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.568006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.465872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.414693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.404782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.390148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.312451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoid tissue","weight":0.267195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
