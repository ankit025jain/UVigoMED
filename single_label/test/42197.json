{"id":42197,"title":"Intraoperative cholangiography still a current investigation.","abstract":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment for patients requiring gallbladder removal. Although the advantages of the laparoscopic technique are widely accepted, the introduction of this technique has doubled the rate of iatrogenic lesions of extrahepatic bile ducts. Research methods for biliary tree also evolved, but intraoperative cholangiography, the traditional exploring method used for the biliary tree in classic cholecystectomy remains a valuable investigation in the laparoscopic technique. We performed a retrospective study on a group of patients who underwent cholecystectomy (laparoscopic or classic). Of these, intraoperative cholangiography was performed on a total of 108 patients. Patients who underwent cholangiography motivated by preoperative investigations were excluded from the group and the study operates on patients in whom the decision to perform cholangiography was taken during surgery (45 cases). We have analyzed the criteria that led to the motivation investigation (dilated cystic duct, suspected biliary duct stones, suspicion of iatrogenic biliary injury) results and subsequent therapeutic conduct. The results showed that in 90% of the patients, the suspected diagnosis was confirmed by cholangiography (10 cases with normal cholangiography aspect, oddita 9 cases, 11 cases with bile duct stones, 2 cases with biliary tumor and 13 cases of iatrogenic biliary injury). In conclusion, the decision to perform intraoperative cholangiography proved salutary, the suspected diagnosis was confirmed and the course of treatment was adjusted accordingly.
