{"id":24411,"title":"Molecular epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of Serbian Cryptococcus neoformans isolates.","abstract":"Molecular typing and antifungal susceptibility testing of 34 clinical Serbian Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from 25 patients was retrospectively performed. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting was used for genotyping, whereas a novel real-time PCR was used to determine the mating- and serotype. The antifungals amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole were used to determine the antifungal susceptibility profiles. The majority of isolates belonged to genotype AFLP1/VNI (n = 20; 58.8%), followed by AFLP2/VNIV (n = 10; 29.4%), AFLP3/VNIII (n = 3; 8.8%) and AFLP1B/VNII (n = 1; 2.9%). All AFLP1/VNI isolates were mating-serotype ?A, the sole AFLP1B/VNII isolate was found to be aA, whereas AFLP2/VNIV harboured serotype D isolates with either the a (n = 2; 5.9%) or ? (n = 8; 23.5%) mating-type allele. The isolates (n = 3; 8.8%) that were found to be genotype AFLP3/VNIII had the hybrid mating- and serotype combination aA-?D. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing showed that all isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole and posaconazole. Low resistance level was observed for fluconazole (n = 1; 2.9%) and 5-fluorocytosine. (n = 2; 5.8%). A large percentage of isolates was found to be susceptible dose dependent to itraconazole (n = 16; 47.1%). AFLP1/VNI was the most common genotype among clinical C. neoformans isolates from immunocompromised patients in Serbia. C. neoformans from HIV-negative patients were significantly less susceptible to 5-fluorocytosine (P < 0.01). Correlation between genotypes and antifungal susceptibility was not observed.
