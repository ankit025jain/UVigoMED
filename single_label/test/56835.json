{"id":56835,"title":"Congenital fixed dilated pupils due to ACTA2- multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome.","abstract":"Congenital fixed dilated pupils (congenital mydriasis) is characterized by hypoplasia or aplasia of the iris muscles, with absence of iris between the collarette and pupillary border, creating a scalloped pupillary margin. This condition has been reported in a multisystemic smooth muscle cell dysfunction syndrome, combined with congenital patent ductus arteriosus, cerebrovascular disease (Moya-moya-like), coronary artery disease, thoracic aorta aneurysm, and dysfunction of smooth muscle cells in organs throughout the body. All affected individuals carry a p.R179H heterozygous mutation in the ACTA2 gene. We add to the ophthalmologic involvement with 3 more patients. Congenital fixed dilated pupils is a rare condition and should alert ophthalmologists to the possibility of the coexistence of systemic life-threatening disorders.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621862","annotations":[{"name":"Mydriasis","weight":0.897172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydriasis"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Patent ductus arteriosus","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.780078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.695988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.624799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.558183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.365507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Thoracic aorta","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_aorta"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.308238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
