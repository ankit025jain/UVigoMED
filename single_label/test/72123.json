{"id":72123,"title":"Exploring silver as a contrast agent for contrast-enhanced dual-energy X-ray breast imaging.","abstract":"Through prior monoenergetic modelling, we have identified silver as a potential alternative to iodine in dual-energy (DE) X-ray breast imaging. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of silver and iodine contrast agents in a commercially available DE imaging system through a quantitative analysis of signal difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR).A polyenergetic simulation algorithm was developed to model the signal intensity and noise. The model identified the influence of various technique parameters on SDNR. The model was also used to identify the optimal imaging techniques for silver and iodine, so that the two contrast materials could be objectively compared.The major influences on the SDNR were the low-energy dose fraction and breast thickness. An increase in the value of either of these parameters resulted in a decrease in SDNR. The SDNR for silver was on average 43% higher than that for iodine when imaged at their respective optimal conditions, and 40% higher when both were imaged at the optimal conditions for iodine.A silver contrast agent should provide benefit over iodine, even when translated to the clinic without modification of imaging system or protocol. If the system were slightly modified to reflect the lower k-edge of silver, the difference in SDNR between the two materials would be increased.These data are the first to demonstrate the suitability of silver as a contrast material in a clinical contrast-enhanced DE image acquisition system.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998157","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.376841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"German language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Radiocontrast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocontrast"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"}]}
