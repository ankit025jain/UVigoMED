{"id":84555,"title":"[Quality of life among overweight women with chronic non-communicable diseases].","abstract":"This study aimed to identify quality of life and its associated factors within women who are overweight and have noncommunicable diseases. It was a cross sectional study with a convenience sample of 50 adult and elderly women enrolled in an \"Academia da Cidade\" in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. For quality of life assessment, the WHOQOL-bref was used. A descriptive analysis in addition to uni and multivariate linear regression were conducted. \"Social relations\" was the domain which most have contributed to quality of life, followed by \"physical\" domain. Worse quality of life was associated with self-reported presence of gastritis/ulcer (beta = -11.980, p = 0.011), medication use (beta = -7.730, p = 0.035), high per capita consumption of sugar (beta = -0.092, 0.045), elevated body mass index (beta= -1.218, p = 0.048) and high carbohydrate intake (beta = -0.388, p = 0.042). Many factors are associated to quality of life, that should be considered in health programs.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
