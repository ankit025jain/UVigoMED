{"id":71964,"title":"Evaluation of carrier added and no carrier added 90Y-EDTMP as bone seeking therapeutic radiopharmaceutical.","abstract":"The optimum conditions to label ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) compound with (90)y as a potential candidate for bone metastases therapy were investigated. Yttrium-90 is a pure ?-emitter and can be obtained by (89)y (n,?) (90)y nuclear reaction in a reactor or from an in-house generator system ((90)sr?(90)y). The preparation of (90)Y-EDTMPis described using (90)y, which was obtained from neutron irradiation of y2o3 as well as from a laboratory scale organic resin-based (90)sr--(90)y generator. Because of the radiolabeling yield of 90Y-EDTMP on ligand/metal molar ratio, incubation time and ph was evaluated. Under optimum parameters, the radiolabeling yields of (90)Y-EDTMP were <95% for no-carrier-added as well as carrier-added (90)y. The biodistribution of no-carrier-added and carrier-added (90)Y-EDTMP complexes in rats was identical. The results indicate that (90)y (carrier-added)-edtmp is also an effective bone pain palliation agent because of its rapid blood clearance, greater uptake in bones and little absorption in soft tissues.
