{"id":72361,"title":"What is a good death? An exploration of issues at the end of life through phenomenological analysis of selected dramatic literature.","abstract":"This study sets out to understand what might constitute a good death in the current UK context. It uses the demographic changes which have taken place in UK society over the period of the twentieth century to offer explanations for our relative unfamiliarity with dying and death. The study draws on two plays written by Nell Dunn as the data source; these are Home Death (2011) and Cancer Tales (2002), which are based on end-of-life experiences. A phenomenological approach is used to analyse this literature, drawing on the works of selected phenomenologists whose work is appropriate in the end-of-life context. Phenomenology seeks to understand the meaning of experience. This approach is used to gain an understanding of the meaning of the lived experiences of terminally ill patients, and their loved ones in order to gain a better appreciation of some of the needs and concerns which are important in end-of-life situations. Finally, the implications of the findings for end-of-life care are discussed in the light of recommendations of the recent report More Care Less Pathway (2013) which criticizes the implementation of the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient in some hospital settings.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979875","annotations":[{"name":"Literature","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Drama","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.497399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.424061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Phenomenology (philosophy)","weight":0.397326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Liverpool","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool"},{"name":"Nell Dunn","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nell_Dunn"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Nell (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nell_(film)"},{"name":"Western Lombard literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Lombard_literature"},{"name":"Clinical pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pathway"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
