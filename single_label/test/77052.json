{"id":77052,"title":"A first case of endoscopical removal of an eroded adjustable gastric band in Croatia.","abstract":"Laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) is one of the most common surgical procedures in the treatment of morbid obesity since it provides good long-term outcomes in weight loss and decrease of comorbidities associated with obesity. Although the procedure has low morbidity and almost none-existing mortality, certain complications can occur. Erosion of the band into the gastric wall is one of the rare complications in LAGB. The reported incidence varies from 1 to 11%, however the largest study reported an incidence of 1.6%. This is in accordance with the incidence in our Centre for obesity, where only one case of erosion occurred among 112 operative procedures. The aim of this paper is to present a patient with gastric band erosion and it's removal by using the endoscopic techniques as a minimally invasive management method.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851640","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.7114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.698659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.695363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Adjustable gastric band","weight":0.408333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustable_gastric_band"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
