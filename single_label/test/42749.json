{"id":42749,"title":"[Optimal use of proton pump inhibitors in primary care].","abstract":"Acid peptic diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal reflux disease have a high prevalence; they can have an important impact on the patient's quality of life and generate a considerable health care cost. Proton pump inhibitors are the most potent pharmacological inhibitors of gastric acid secretion currently available and are the mainstay medical therapy for acid peptic diseases. This review provides primary care clinicians with best practice guidelines for optimal use of these drugs.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830213","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Gastric acid","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.748916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.541668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.532968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.514448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.302019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.271558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"}]}
