{"id":24467,"title":"The effect of ?-glucan on formation and functionality of neutrophil extracellular traps in carp (Cyprinus carpio L.).","abstract":"The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been characterised as a novel antimicrobial host defence strategy of neutrophils besides phagocytosis and degranulation, which may lead to entrapment and subsequent immobilisation and/or killing of bacterial pathogens. Here we studied the effect of the feed additive ?-glucan, namely MacroGard(Â®), on the formation and functionality of NETs in carp. Therefore, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) head kidney and kidney cells were isolated and treated with or without ?-glucan over time. The formation of NETs was analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy and revealed a distinct increase of NET-formation with ?-glucan. Furthermore the subsequent entrapment of Aeromonas hydrophila, an important fish pathogen, was increased after stimulating the cells with ?-glucan. However, ?-glucan did not lead to a stimulation of antimicrobial activity of neutrophils against A. hydrophila. In conclusion, the data underline the fact that the feed additive ?-glucan is able to modulate carp neutrophil functions.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434196","annotations":[{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.866004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Degranulation","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degranulation"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.545282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.296439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Carp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carp"},{"name":"Common carp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carp"},{"name":"Aeromonas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas"},{"name":"Aeromonas hydrophila","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas_hydrophila"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Cyprinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprinus"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Underline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underline"},{"name":"Animal trapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trapping"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Feed additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_additive"},{"name":"Entrapment","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment"},{"name":"Glucan","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucan"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
