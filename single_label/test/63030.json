{"id":63030,"title":"Is cure of chronic myeloid leukemia in the third millennium a down to earth target (ed) or a castle in the air?","abstract":"The therapeutic approach in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has undergone a revolutionary change during the last 2 decades with the introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The use of these agents has changed overall survival as well as the quality of life of CML patients. Since the introduction of imatinib, newer agents have been developed and their role as first line treatment was examined. The use of genomics and proteomics as a means to tailor treatment of CML patients is underway. Meanwhile, clinical parameters as disease phase and response to treatment are used to guide a personalized approach. In this review, we will discuss the various aspects of personalized medicine in CML, including the use of the different scoring systems to guide treatment, disease phase as a means to choose the proper approach and the value of early response evaluation in decision-making. The approach towards patients resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), individual strategies for discontinuation of TKIs and \"operational\" cure in CML will also be discussed and finally the personalized treatment for CML patients in the near future based on present outcomes.
