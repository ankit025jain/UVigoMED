{"id":91430,"title":"Novel technique for preoperative pedicle localization in spinal surgery with challenging anatomy.","abstract":"Accurately localizing a spine level in the thoracic spine is often not easily achieved with the existing imaging modalities available in the operating room. The coordination of the preoperative imaging pathology with intraoperative imaging is even more difficult in patients with challenging anatomy. Using standard percutaneous techniques, the authors placed a radiopaque embolization coil into the pedicle of interest under biplanar fluoroscopy in 1 patient. Thoracic spine MRI along with scout MRI was then performed to confirm coil marker placement in relation to the actual spine pathology prior to surgical intervention. No complications were observed during placement of the radiopaque marker. Intraoperatively, the marker was immediately and easily visualized, leading to a confident identification of the correct thoracic spinal level. The preoperative placement of a radiopaque marker into the vertebral pedicle of the identified pathological level combined with postplacement MRI verification provides an advantage over previously proposed techniques in the literature.
