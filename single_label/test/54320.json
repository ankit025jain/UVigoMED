{"id":54320,"title":"Resveratrol ameliorates diabetic vascular inflammation and macrophage infiltration in db/db mice by inhibiting the NF-?B pathway.","abstract":"In this study, resveratrol (RSV) - a potent sirtuin 1 activator - was found to have beneficial effects on glucolipid metabolism and improve inflammatory mediators and markers of oxidative stress. Diabetic (db/db) mice and non-diabetic C57BL/6J mice were used in the study. The db/db mice were treated with or without 0.3% RSV mixed with chow for 8 weeks. Dietary RSV significantly lowered blood glucose, plasma lipid and free fatty acid levels in db/db mice. RSV markedly inhibited the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the aorta and the blood plasma of db/db mice (p < 0.05). Levels of mac-3-positive macrophages (measure of the infiltration of activated macrophages) were lower in RSV-treated diabetic mice than in their untreated counterparts (p < 0.05). RSV treatment reduced the activity of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) in aortic tissues (p < 0.05). Thus, RSV treatment reduced ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expression in the aorta and ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 levels in the plasma of diabetic mice. Since dietary supplementation with RSV also reduced NF-?B activities in the aorta, the therapeutic effects of RSV might be associated with the downregulation of NF-?B.
