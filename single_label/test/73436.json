{"id":73436,"title":"Adding ascorbic acid to arsenic trioxide produces limited benefit in patients with acute myeloid leukemia excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia.","abstract":"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is highly effective in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but despite its multiple mechanism of action, it has no activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that excludes APL (non-APL AML). Ascorbic acid (AA) and ATO induces apoptosis in AML cell lines by depleting intracellular glutathione and generation of reactive oxygen species. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ATO plus AA in patients with non-APL AML. The study enrolled patient aged 18 or older with relapsed or refractory AML (non-APL) after conventional chemotherapy or previously untreated patients 55 years or older who were unfit for standard induction chemotherapy for AML. Intravenous ATO (0.25 mg/kg/day over 1-4 h) was given with intravenous AA (1 g/day over 30 min after ATO) for 5 days a week for 5 weeks (25 doses). Eleven AML patients were enrolled, including six previously untreated elderly patients aged 66-84 years in whom five had antecedent hematological disorder (ADH). Among 10 evaluable patients, one achieved a CR one a CRi and 4 patients had disappearance of blasts from peripheral blood and bone marrow. Five of the six responders were seen in previously untreated elderly patients. ATO related toxicity was mild. The combination of ATO and AA has limited clinical meaningful antileukemia activity in patients with non-APL AML.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906216","annotations":[{"name":"Arsenic trioxide","weight":0.914023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_trioxide"},{"name":"Ascorbic acid","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.84813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Acute promyelocytic leukemia","weight":0.800593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_promyelocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.748245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.456416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Vasopressin","weight":0.394706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.343592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.13286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.110686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
