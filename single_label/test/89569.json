{"id":89569,"title":"Treatment of malar and midfacial fractures with osteoconductive forged unsintered hydroxyapatite and poly-L-lactide composite internal fixation devices.","abstract":"To evaluate the internal fixation of malar and midfacial fractures, long-term results, and biocompatibility of osteoconductive internal fixation devices composed of a forged composite of unsintered hydroxyapatite and poly-L-lactide (F-u-HA/PLLA).From January 2006 to June 2010, 29 patients (24 males and 5 females; age 33 Â± 15 years) were included in the present prospective study. The fracture type was malar in 24 patients, midfacial in 5, isolated orbital floor blowout in 2, and frontal sinus, cranial base in 2 patients. The fractures were fixed with internal fixation devices; these were plates and screws composed of F-u-HA/PLLA. The 24 patients with malar fractures were treated with a single 4-hole L-plate or a straight plate at the infrazygomatic crest.All fractures with internal fixation using devices composed of F-u-HA/PLLA healed well. All malar and midfacial fractures had satisfactory long-term stability. The follow-up examinations at 12 to 67 months after surgery showed that most patients had no complaints, although 2 patients (15%) had a foreign body reaction that was treated by implant removal, with complete symptom resolution. At 5 years after fracture fixation, 2 patients had ultrasound and 2 had radiographic evidence of residual material. An exemplar biopsy showed direct bone growth into the material.In patients with malar and midfacial fractures, hardware composed of the F-u-HA/PLLA composite provided reliable and satisfactory internal fixation, intraoperative handling, long-term stability, and biocompatibility. Direct bone growth into the material could be histopathologically exemplified, in contrast to previous polymer fixations that were resorbed and surrounded by a connective tissue layer. This finding indicates that long-term F-u-HA/PLLA residual material will be included into the remodeled bone, which was confirmed on long-term follow-up radiographs.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704037","annotations":[{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.878915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.728095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.693269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Frontal sinus","weight":0.640562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_sinus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.587969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.46174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.344756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.225688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.0763854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0700436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Chiropractic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Holotype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"}]}
