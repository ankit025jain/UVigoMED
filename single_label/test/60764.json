{"id":60764,"title":"[Cancer recurrence or sarcoidosis: the essential contribution of pathology].","abstract":"The development of pulmonary nodules or lymph nodes in the course of a malignancy, in particular breast cancer, can sometimes correspond to the onset of sarcoidosis. Osteolytic lesions can simultaneously occur which further strengthens the impression of a metastatic disease. No particular test, biological markers or imaging technique, has a satisfactory discriminating power and a biopsy is needed to establish the correct diagnosis and decide on the adequate treatment. The concomitance of sarcoidosis and cancer raises the possibility of a granolumatous disease.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830216","annotations":[{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.438274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.10852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
