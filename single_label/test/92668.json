{"id":92668,"title":"Trends of keratinocyte carcinoma mortality rates in the United States as reported on death certificates, 1999 through 2010.","abstract":"From 1969 to 1998, keratinocyte carcinoma (KC) mortality rates declined as reported on death certificates, despite increasing incidence of KC.To estimate KC mortality trends from 1999 to 2010 in the United States.Descriptive and linear regression analysis using population-based death certificate data from the US National Center for Health Statistics.On average, 1,491 deaths from nongenital KC and 1,058 deaths from genital KC were reported annually. Keratinocyte carcinoma mortality rates were stable or increasing over the study period. Highest nongenital mortality rates were seen in those older than 85 years (p < .001), men (p < .001), whites (p < .001), the South for white males (p = .001) and white females (p = .018), and nonmetropolitan areas for white males (p <.001), white females (p < .001), and black females (p = .005). Correlation between state UV Index and KC mortality existed for men (p = .004) but not for women (p = .379). Genital KC deaths increased with age (p < .001), in women (p < .001), and in less urbanized areas for white males (p < .001).Keratinocyte carcinoma poses a serious health burden, which may be underestimated by death certificate reporting. Mortality rates are no longer declining. Increasing awareness of genital and nongenital KC, especially the elderly, and population-based studies with controlled reporting of KC mortality are needed.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393350","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.640298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.532424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.530164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.425681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"National Center for Health Statistics","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Health_Statistics"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.279122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.237544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Urbanization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Ultraviolet index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_index"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"379","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/379"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Fad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad"},{"name":"Academic certificate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_certificate"},{"name":"Medical statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_statistics"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Death certificate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_certificate"},{"name":"Queen's Counsel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Counsel"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"2010 in the United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_in_the_United_States"}]}
