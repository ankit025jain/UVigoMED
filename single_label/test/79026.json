{"id":79026,"title":"Mid-term results of frontovertical partial laryngectomy for early glottic carcinoma with anterior commissure involvement.","abstract":"Frontovertical partial laryngectomy is useful for treatment of T1 and T2 glottic squamous cell carcinoma with anterior commissure involvement.To evaluate the efficiency of frontovertical partial laryngectomy for T1 and T2 glottic carcinoma with anterior commissure involvement.This was a retrospective review of 58 cases of glottic squamous cell carcinoma with anterior commissure involvement (T1, n = 28; T2, n = 30) that were treated by frontovertical partial laryngectomy between August 2000 and August 2010.Postoperative pathology reports confirmed negative tumor margins in every case. All patients were followed postoperatively, with a median follow-up interval of 55 months. Three patients had local recurrence; there were no patients who had cervical or distant metastases. The 3-year local control rate was 94% according to life tables curves. There were no reports of laryngostenosis or dysphagia in any patients, and mean Voice Handicap Index (VHI) questionnaire scores were 32.9.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506297","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.782845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.753561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.679806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.670054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.631563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.466133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Life table","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table"},{"name":"Vhi Healthcare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vhi_Healthcare"},{"name":"Anterior commissure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_commissure"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Professional wrestling match types","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Handicap (golf)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_(golf)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Relaxation (NMR)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)"},{"name":"Commissure","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissure"}]}
