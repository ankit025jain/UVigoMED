{"id":24615,"title":"[The content of fibronectin in blood serum in patients with myocardium infarction depending on age].","abstract":"The fibronectin, being one of main components of extracellular matrix of myocardium, is involved into post-infarction repair process. However, the role of fibronectin in this process in patients with myocardium infarction in various periods of their life continues to be a controversial issue. To decide this point the study was organized concerning analysis of content of fibronectin in blood serum in 75 males of three different age groups (prior to 49 years, 50-59 years, 60 -69 years). It is demonstrated that in two groups (prior to 49 years and 50-59 years) the maximal content of fibronectin was marked at second phase regarding to data at first and third phase of reparation process. Whereas in patients aged 60-69 years the maximal content of fibronectin was detected at first phase of reparation process regarding to such in patients aged 50-59 years. The lower content of fibronectin was detected in third phase of reparation process regarding to analogous indicator in other two age groups of patients. These dynamics of content of fibronectin in patients of elder age apparently is an evidence of lower reparation potential of extracellular matrix.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335392","annotations":[{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.373306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.156982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"}]}
