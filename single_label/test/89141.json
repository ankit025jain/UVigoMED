{"id":89141,"title":"Liver laceration from a diaphragmatic suture in minithoracotomy mitral valve repair.","abstract":"Mitral valve operations are increasingly performed through minimally invasive approaches such as the right anterior minithoracotomy. To facilitate exposure with this technique, a diaphragmatic suture may be implemented. We describe a liver laceration caused by the diaphragmatic suture in minithoracotomy mitral repair and its successful nonoperative management with arterial embolization.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750236","annotations":[{"name":"Liver","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.727272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.609132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.218284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mitral valve repair","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_repair"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Heart valve repair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve_repair"},{"name":"Laceration","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laceration"}]}
