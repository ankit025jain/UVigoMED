{"id":72398,"title":"STAT of the union: dynamics of distinct tumor-associated macrophage subsets governed by STAT1.","abstract":"The tumor stroma has long been ignored as therapeutic target, but it has become clear that several stromal cell types play a nonredundant role during tumor progression. In particular, macrophages possess the capacity to stimulate tumor growth and metastasis via multiple mechanisms. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, a study by Tymoszuk et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 2247-2262 demonstrates that both monocyte recruitment and local macrophage proliferation determines the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) pool size in HER2/Neu-driven mammary carcinomas. These tumors contain two main TAM subsets--MHC class II (MHC-II)(lo) F4/80(hi) and MHC-II(hi) F4/80(lo)--similar to what was observed in other tumor models. Interestingly, only the MHC-II(lo) F4/80(hi) subset is largely absent in a STAT1-deficient background. STAT1 induces the expression of CSF-1, which in turn drives TAM proliferation and possibly also the M2 gene signature of MHC-II(lo) F4/80(hi) TAM. Conversely, STAT1 deficiency upregulates M2 gene expression in MHC-II(hi) F4/80(lo) TAM, demonstrating that both TAM subsets are differentially regulated, probably as a consequence of their distinct intratumoral localization. In this Commentary, we place these findings in the context of current knowledge and propose new avenues for future research.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975396","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.647034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.559801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.463709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Macrophage colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.430486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.297724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.246841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.204876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"STAT1","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT1"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0197861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Exaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaptation"}]}
