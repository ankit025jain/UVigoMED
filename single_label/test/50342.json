{"id":50342,"title":"Efficacy of voglibose in type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is currently at epidemic proportions and the forecast is for a continued sharp increase in global prevalence. An even larger proportion of the population has prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) underscoring the urgent need for preventive strategies. Even in the presence of adequate glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, postprandial hyperglycemia can occur and is known to have a stronger association with cardiovascular morbidity than fasting glucose. The ?-glucosidase inhibitor voglibose is widely used in Japan to improve postprandial hyperglycemia.This review examines the literature for the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of voglibose in patients with T2DM. Particular focus is on its efficacy in preventing T2DM in individuals with IGT and its efficacy as add-on therapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents in patients with T2DM.As the relationship between glucose levels and cardiovascular risk extends below the diabetic threshold, postprandial hyperglycemia is recognized as a key therapeutic target in the treatment of T2DM. Strategies to prevent the progression of IGT to overt T2DM have enormous potential to reduce the individual and societal burden of disease. Voglibose is the first oral antidiabetic agent to gain approval in Japan for this indication.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798092","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.839264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.803268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.802204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.776875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.725634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.686871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.543164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Glycoside hydrolase","weight":0.247227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Voglibose","weight":0.146367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voglibose"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
