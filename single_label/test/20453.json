{"id":20453,"title":"Infectious morbidity is higher after second-stage compared with first-stage cesareans.","abstract":"The objective of the study was to compare maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity following cesareans performed in the second and first stages of labor.We conducted a retropective cohort study of all consecutive, singleton, term, cesarean deliveries in laboring women in a single institution from 2005 to 2012. Second-stage cesareans were defined as those performed at complete cervical dilation (10 cm), and first-stage cesareans were those performed before 10 cm cervical dilation. The primary outcome was endometritis. Rates of infectious morbidity were compared in the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted risk estimates.Of 2505 cesareans meeting inclusion criteria, 400 (16.0%) were performed in the second stage, whereas 2105 (84.0%) were performed in the first stage of labor. The risk of endometritis was nearly 3-fold higher in second- compared with first-stage cesareans (4.25% vs 1.52%; crude odds ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-5.23). The risk remained significantly higher after controlling for confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-5.09).Second-stage cesarean is associated with an increased risk of endometritis compared with first-stage cesarean. Further studies will determine whether different infection preventive strategies are needed at second-stage cesareans to reduce endometritis.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657794","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.800237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.781434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cervical dilation","weight":0.741273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_dilation"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.730996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.412499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.408201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Endometritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometritis"},{"name":"Singleton (mathematics)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"585","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/585"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Richard O'Connor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_O'Connor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"2100s (decade)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2100s_(decade)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
