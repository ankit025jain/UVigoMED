{"id":86638,"title":"Therapeutic implications of microRNAs in pulmonary arterial hypertension.","abstract":"microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that play critical posttranscriptional regulatory roles typically through targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of messenger RNA (mRNA). Mature miRNAs are known to be involved in global cellular processes, such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and organogenesis, due to their capacity to target multiple mRNAs. Thus, imbalances in the expression and/or activity of miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a progressive disease characterized by vascular remodeling due to excessive proliferation of pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Recently, studies have evaluated the roles of miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of PAH in these pulmonary vascular cells. This review provides an overview of recent discoveries on the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of PAH and discusses the potential for miRNAs as therapeutic targets and biomarkers of PAH.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755557","annotations":[{"name":"Organogenesis","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organogenesis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.765763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.758945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.673817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.454221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.417482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.401749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.343702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.291842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Five prime untranslated region","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_prime_untranslated_region"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"}]}
