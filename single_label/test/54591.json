{"id":54591,"title":"Choroidal thickness in healthy Turkish subjects.","abstract":"To investigate choroidal thickness in healthy Turkish subjects.Refraction, axial length (AXL) measurement, anterior chamber, and fundus examinations were performed. Eyes that had any retinal or choroidal pathology were excluded from the study. Enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography was used to evaluate choroidal thickness.139 eyes from 70 subjects were investigated. The mean age, AXL, spherical equivalent refractive error (SE), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) were 34.7 +/- 12.7 years, 23.31 +/- 0.91 mm, -0.15 +/- 1.64 diopters (D), and 326 +/- 60 microm, respectively. A negative correlation was found between SCT and AXL (P = 0.043). The mean age, SE, AXL, and SCT were 31.7 +/- 9.3 and 34.6 +/- 14.3 years, -0.27 +/- 1.45 and 0.02 +/- 1.89 D, 23.52 +/- 0.94 and 23.02 +/- 0.75 mm, and 324 +/- 69 and 329 +/- 40 mirom in male and female subjects, respectively (P = 0.14, P = 0.31, P = 0.001, and P = 0.58, respectively). Regression analysis showed that SCT decreased by 0.93 microm for each year of age.In healthy Turkish subjects, SCT decreased by 0.93 pm for each year of age and was thicker in men when the results were adjusted according to AXL measurements.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558559","annotations":[{"name":"Optics","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.430637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.416569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.1401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"324","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/324"},{"name":"Picometre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picometre"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75_mm_Gun_M2/M3/M6"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"},{"name":"AXL receptor tyrosine kinase","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXL_receptor_tyrosine_kinase"}]}
