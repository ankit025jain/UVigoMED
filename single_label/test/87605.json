{"id":87605,"title":"Wrist essentials: the diagnosis and management of scapholunate ligament injuries.","abstract":"After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the pathophysiology of a scapholunate injury. 2. Understand how to diagnose scapholunate injuries 3. Formulate and carry out a surgical plan for patients with a scapholunate injury.Scapholunate ligament instability is the most common form of carpal instability. Untreated scapholunate injuries can lead to a predictable pattern of wrist arthritis. Early forms of scapholunate ligament instability can be missed, and clinical detection relies on an educated observer. This article covers the basic anatomy and biomechanics of the wrist, and reviews in detail scapholunate ligament injury. This article also reviews and discusses the current relevant topics and issues surrounding scapholunate ligament injury.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068352","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.722288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.631607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.621298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.611167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.255017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.162111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Scapholunate ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapholunate_ligament"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Early Cyrillic alphabet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Cyrillic_alphabet"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
