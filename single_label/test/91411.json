{"id":91411,"title":"A severely displaced metaphyseal fracture of the proximal humerus with dislocation of the shoulder in a child.","abstract":"Fracture of the proximal humerus metaphysis with coexistent dislocation of the shoulder in children is a rare injury. The injury often occurs as a consequence of high velocity trauma. Most fractures of the proximal humerus commonly associated with the epiphysis in children can be treated with closed reduction. We presented a case of 5-year-old girl who sustained this type of fracture- dislocation of the shoulder. Open reduction and internal fixation with multiple smooth K-wires was performed. At two years follow-up, the patient was pain free and regained full range of motion.
