{"id":85274,"title":"Simplified cavernostomy using wound protector for complex pulmonary aspergilloma.","abstract":"A 64-year-old man presented with dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, and continuous low-grade fever. Chest radiography and computed tomography revealed a right-sided, thick-walled cavity with diseased lung parenchyma, and sputum microscopy confirmed fungal forms of aspergillus. He subsequently developed a left-sided pneumonia caused by aspiration of the right-sided abscess. Because lung resection was considered too invasive, we performed simplified cavernostomy using the Alexis Wound Protector (XXS) using local anesthesia. In addition to the excellent drainage outcomes, this procedure was both simple and efficient. Moreover, the procedure was associated with less pain and physical limitation for the patient.
