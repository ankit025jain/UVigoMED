{"id":34728,"title":"[A novel splicing mutation in COL1A1 gene caused type I osteogenesis imperfecta in a Chinese family].","abstract":"To study a family affected with osteogenesis imperfecta for potential mutations in COL1A1 gene.Clinical data of an affected family was collected. Potential mutation of the COL1A1 gene was screened using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Suspected mutation was detected in 20 unaffected relatives and 200 unrelated healthy controls.Analysis of RNA splicing has revealed a c.3208G/A mutation, which created a new splice sites and led to a frameshift mutation. The same mutation was not detected in the unaffected relatives or the 200 healthy controls.Mutations of the COL1A1 gene are one of the major causes of osteogenesis imperfecta in Chinese population. Our finding has enriched the mutation spectrum of type I collagen genes.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24711029","annotations":[{"name":"Frameshift mutation","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameshift_mutation"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.834754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.617984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.551453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.508968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Translational frameshift","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.194444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Allopatric speciation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Collagen, type I, alpha 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen,_type_I,_alpha_1"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Chinese people in Burma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Burma"},{"name":"Type-I collagen","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-I_collagen"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
