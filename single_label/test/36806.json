{"id":36806,"title":"Tendon transfers in cavovarus foot.","abstract":"The use of tendon transfers in the cavovarus foot is a common surgical procedure because of the muscular imbalance present in this pathologic condition. Therefore, deforming forces are transferred to obtain movement and function. General principles must be followed for transfers to work; depending on the muscle deficiency and the function to restore, different tendon transfer options exist. The authors do not recommend tendon transfers for forefoot deformities in this setting. Postoperatively tendon transfers should be protected in a removable boot, but early protected weight bearing and motion is stimulated to obtain a well-functioning transfer and not a tenodesis.
