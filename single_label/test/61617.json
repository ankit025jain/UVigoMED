{"id":61617,"title":"Study of anemia in adolescents female and effect information, education and communication in rural area of central Kathmandu Valley.","abstract":"Adolescence is a period of rapid change and opportunities. It is a coming up of age as children grow into young adults. It constitutes 10-19 yrs of age. In Nepal 23% of the population are adolescents. Across-sectional community based study was carried out in 3 schools in Jhaukhel (Bhaktapur) to determine the prevalence of anemia and the effect of IEC in female adolescents. Does IEC effect improve anemia rapidly. Two hundred four female school children were screened for Hemoglobin estimation by Simple Random Sampling method. Physical examination and nutritional assessment was also done. Hemoglobin estimation was done by Cynomethemoglobin method in their respective schools. Anemia was diagnosed according to WHO guidelines. IEC was given to all adolescents girls thrice in 1 month and again the effect of IEC was studied by estimating hemoglobin. Out of 204, 72 (35.3%) had anemia. Forty (34.2%) had anemia in the age group of 13-15 yrs, followed by 19 in age group 10-12 yrs and mild anemia was found in the age group 16-19 yrs. The adolescents girls whose parents were farmers and labourers were more anemic than others. Twelve (44.4%) maximum anemic girls were observed in those whose parental income was between NPRs 12000-16000. Out of 204 girls only 157 attained menarche. All girls 52 (33.1%) who attained menarche upto 13 yrs had more anemia than others of above 13 yrs of age group. The mean age at menarche was 13.05 yrs. The subjects exhibited increase in Hb significantly P value 0.000. Mean Hb before IEC was 12.26 (SD 1.43) and after IEC it was 12.81 (SD +/- 1.05). The Mean increase in percentage after IEC was 4.48 (SD +/- 9.68) in females. The Range was 20 to 41.18%. The Coefficient of relationship (Karl Pearson coefficient of correlation) between two Hb levels before and after giving IEC was 0.719, which is statistically significant with positive correlation (p = .000) and r2 = 0.516. It is represented as scattered diagram.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696933","annotations":[{"name":"Karl Pearson","weight":0.836483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.822493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.817494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.777399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.715993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.687199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.666962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.521298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Simple random sample","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample"},{"name":"Nepal","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.356403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.344571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"School","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Kathmandu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu"},{"name":"Menarche","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menarche"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Diagram","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram"},{"name":"Laborer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laborer"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"}]}
