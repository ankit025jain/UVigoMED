{"id":36318,"title":"Idiopathic left ventricular apical hypoplasia.","abstract":"A 46-year-old man was found to have an abnormal ECG taken during a routine health and blood pressure check. His only symptom was non-specific central chest discomfort, unrelated to exertion. His ECG showed sinus rhythm, a normal axis and poor R wave progression across the chest leads and lateral T wave flattening. An echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with a thin and hypokinetic septum bulging to the right. The apex was 'not well seen' but also appeared thin and hypokinetic. The right heart and valves were normal. The patient was further investigated for left ventricular hypoplasia.
