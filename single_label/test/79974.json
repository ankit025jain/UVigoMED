{"id":79974,"title":"Does the National Health Insurance Scheme in Ghana reduce household cost of treating malaria in the Kassena-Nankana districts?","abstract":"The Government of Ghana introduced the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2003 to replace out-of-pocket (OOP) payment for health services with the inherent aim of reducing the direct cost of treating illness to households.To assess the effects of the NHIS in reducing cost of treating malaria to households in the Kassena-Nankana districts of northern Ghana.We conducted a cross-sectional survey between October 2009 and October 2011 in the Kassena-Nankana districts. A sample of 4,226 households was randomly drawn from the Navrongo Health and Demographic Surveillance System household database and administered a structured interview. The costs of malaria treatment were collected from the patient perspective.Of the 4,226 households visited, a total of 1,324 (31%) household members reported fever and 51% (675) reported treatment for malaria and provided information on where they sought care. Most respondents sought malaria treatment from formal health facilities 63% (424), with the remainder either self-medicating with drugs from chemical shops 32% (217) or with leftover drugs or herbs 5% (34). Most of those who sought care from formal health facilities were insured 79% (334). The average direct medical cost of treating malaria was GH¢3.2 (US$2.1) per case with the insured spending less (GH¢2.6/US$1.7) per case than the uninsured (GH¢3.2/US$2.1). The overall average cost (direct and indirect) incurred by households per malaria treatment was GH¢20.9 (US$13.9). Though the insured accounted for a larger proportion of admissions at health facilities 76% (31) than the uninsured 24% (10), the average amount households spent on the insured was less (GH¢4/US$2.7) than their uninsured counterparts (GH¢6.4/US$4.3). The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.2330).Even though some insured individuals made OOP payments for direct medical care, there is evidence that the NHIS has a protective effect on cost (outpatient and in-patient) of malaria treatment.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Parasitic
