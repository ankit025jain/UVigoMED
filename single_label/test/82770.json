{"id":82770,"title":"The effect of periodontal status and occlusal support on masticatory performance: the Suita study.","abstract":"In this study, we investigated the effect of differences in periodontal status in the masticatory performance of dentate subjects with the same occlusal supporting area.The subjects of the analysis were classified into those of Eichner A1-3 (n = 1094) and Eichner B1-4 (n = 529). Subjects' periodontal status was evaluated on the basis of the Community Periodontal Index (CPI). The number of functional teeth and occlusal support were investigated, the latter on the basis of the Eichner Index. Furthermore, masticatory performance was investigated by means of test gummy jelly. For each group, periodontal status was classified in two different ways, either with/without moderate periodontitis (CPI Code ?2/?3) or with/without severe periodontitis (CPI Code ?3/4), and masticatory performance was compared between the various groups.In subjects who were Eichner A1 and B3, masticatory performance was significantly lower in subjects with moderate periodontitis compared with those without, and in subjects with severe periodontitis compared with those without.Periodontal disease affects masticatory performance not only if occlusion is established by natural dentition with no tooth loss but also if occlusal support has decreased.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527750","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.80712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.757355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.608877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.518045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.491498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.157094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.098008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Suita","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suita"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"529","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/529"},{"name":"1094","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1094"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Gummi candy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummi_candy"},{"name":"Community (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Communist Party of India","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
