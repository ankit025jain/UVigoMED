{"id":81099,"title":"Anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibody detection in eastern Andalusia (Spain).","abstract":"Chagas disease caused by the protozoan haemoflagellate Trypanosoma cruzi is no longer found exclusively in Latin America; the disease is occurring in Europe, and Spain is the country with the highest prevalence.Our aim was to detect anti-T. cruzi antibodies in blood donors from southeast Spain, and we performed eight serological diagnostic assays on each of 550 blood samples collected in March-June 2010. Two in-house ELISA methods were used to test against a parasite lysate (ELISA-H) and the semi-purified superoxide dismutase excreted by T. cruzi (ELISA-SODe); we also used the Western blot technique against the same antigen (WB-SODe), indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and four commercial tests.The serological test results showed a range of seroprevalence values, the lowest being 1.1%, determined by IFA and two commercial tests (Ab rapid and Chagascreen); other values were: 1.3% (commercial ELISA [Chagas ELISA IgG+IgM]); 2.1% (immunochromatographic test [Stick Chagas]); 2.7% (ELISA-H); 4.0% (WB-SODe); and 4.2%, the highest value (ELISA-SODe).The excellent specificity of SODe antigen for the detection of antibodies to T. cruzi in donors lead us to affirm that the serological test performed with this biomarker could provide a useful screening and confirmatory test method for cases of Chagas disease.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463719","annotations":[{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.904095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.784596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Protozoa","weight":0.728698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.61761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Trypanosoma cruzi","weight":0.593902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.484947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.293064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Local extinction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
