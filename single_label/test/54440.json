{"id":54440,"title":"The histone acetylase activator pentadecylidenemalonate 1b rescues proliferation and differentiation in the human cardiac mesenchymal cells of type 2 diabetic patients.","abstract":"This study investigates the diabetes-associated alterations present in cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMSC) obtained from normoglycemic (ND-CMSC) and type 2 diabetic patients (D-CMSC), identifying the histone acetylase (HAT) activator pentadecylidenemalonate 1b (SPV106) as a potential pharmacological intervention to restore cellular function. D-CMSC were characterized by a reduced proliferation rate, diminished phosphorylation at histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10P), decreased differentiation potential, and premature cellular senescence. A global histone code profiling of D-CMSC revealed that acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9Ac) and lysine 14 (H3K14Ac) was decreased, whereas the trimethylation of H3K9Ac and lysine 27 significantly increased. These observations were paralleled by a downregulation of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNAT) p300/CBP-associated factor and its isoform 5-? general control of amino acid synthesis (GCN5a), determining a relative decrease in total HAT activity. DNA CpG island hypermethylation was detected at promoters of genes involved in cell growth control and genomic stability. Remarkably, treatment with the GNAT proactivator SPV106 restored normal levels of H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac, reduced DNA CpG hypermethylation, and recovered D-CMSC proliferation and differentiation. These results suggest that epigenetic interventions may reverse alterations in human CMSC obtained from diabetic patients.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458358","annotations":[{"name":"Histone code","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_code"},{"name":"CpG island","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.811419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Histone acetyltransferase","weight":0.750493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_acetyltransferase"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"EP300","weight":0.737751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EP300"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histone H3","weight":0.70336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H3"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acetyl","weight":0.621937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyl"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.579123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.515704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.447847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.405584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.393477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.374278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.1621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Amino acid synthesis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid_synthesis"}]}
