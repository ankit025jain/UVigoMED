{"id":47509,"title":"[Therapeutic decisions in patients with operable, non-metastatic oesophageal cancer].","abstract":"Therapy for oesophageal carcinoma is a subject of controversial debate. The aim of this study is to answer the question how the therapeutic decision in patients with operable, non-metastatic oesophageal cancer should be made.A systematic literature research regarding different therapeutic strategies in patients with oesophageal cancer was undertaken.Multiple criteria influence the therapy for oesophageal carcinoma. Radical oesophagectomy in a multimodal setting is the therapy of choice. Definitive chemoradiation is a conservative option for high risk patients.Therapeutic decisions in patients with oesophageal cancer should only be made after standardised staging and accurate risk analysis.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585195","annotations":[{"name":"Risk","weight":0.732188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.639905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.518819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.385244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.307409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.283893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Political radicalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_radicalism"}]}
