{"id":72550,"title":"The roles of retinoic acid and retinoic acid receptors in inducing epigenetic changes.","abstract":"Epigenetics is \"the branch of biology which studies the causal interactions between genes and their products which bring the phenotype into being\" as defined by Conrad Waddington in 1942 in a discussion of the mechanisms of cell differentiation. More than seven decades later we know that these mechanisms include histone tail post-translational modifications, DNA methylation, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA pathways. Epigenetic modifications are powerful drugs targets, and combined targeting of multiple pathways is expected to significantly advance cancer therapy.
