{"id":75741,"title":"Reduced anterior internal capsule white matter integrity in primary insomnia.","abstract":"Chronic insomnia is one of the most prevalent central nervous system diseases, however, its neurobiology is poorly understood. Up to now, nothing is known about the integrity of white matter tracts in insomnia patients. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used in a well-characterized sample of primary insomnia (PI) patients and good sleeper controls to fill this void. Voxelwise between-group comparisons of fractional anisotropy (FA) were performed in 24 PI patients (10 males; 14 females; 42.7 ± 14.5 years) and 35 healthy good sleepers (15 males; 20 females; 40.1 ± 9.1 years) with age and sex as covariates. PI patients showed reduced FA values within the right anterior internal capsule and a trend for reduced FA values in the left anterior internal capsule. The results suggest that insomnia is associated with a reduced integrity of white matter tracts in the anterior internal capsule indicating that disturbed fronto-subcortical connectivity may be a cause or consequence of the disorder.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25050429","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Diffusion tensor imaging","weight":0.812696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_tensor_imaging"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Diffusion MRI","weight":0.502017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI"},{"name":"Anisotropy","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy"},{"name":"Fractional anisotropy","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_anisotropy"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.331944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.303665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tensor","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.168708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.162983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Internal capsule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_capsule"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"Private investigator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Neural pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Nervous system disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system_disease"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Railroad tie","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_tie"}]}
