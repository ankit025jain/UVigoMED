{"id":72867,"title":"Nurses lead the way for \"safe in the sun\" play!","abstract":"Skin cancer prevention is of great importance as it is the most common type of cancer in the United States. Much skin damage occurs early in life. Adolescents are a vulnerable population, as they strive to fit in with their peers, and they neglect sun safety habits. Since a substantial portion of adolescents' time is spent at school, school nurses are in an ideal position to develop and lead a sun safety action plan, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and evidence-based sun safety internet resources. It is hoped that incorporating a culture of skin health promotion and disease prevention among teens will lead to improved health outcomes in the future.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937901","annotations":[{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.742176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.712569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.684308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.493094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.378049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.377566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.325763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.314057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"School","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.064482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Neglect","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglect"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"School nursing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nursing"},{"name":"Idealism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"}]}
