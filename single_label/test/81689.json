{"id":81689,"title":"Concepts in critical thinking applied to caries risk assessment in dental education.","abstract":"Much progress has been made in the science of caries risk assessment and ways to analyze caries risk, yet dental education has seen little movement toward the development of frameworks to guide learning and assess critical thinking in caries risk assessment. In the absence of previous proactive implementation of a learning framework that takes the knowledge of caries risk and critically applies it to the patient with the succinctness demanded in the clinical setting, the purpose of this study was to develop a model learning framework that combines the science of caries risk assessment with principles of critical thinking from the education literature. This article also describes the implementation of that model at one dental school and presents some preliminary assessment data.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882777","annotations":[{"name":"Science","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"School","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.589186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Critical thinking","weight":0.258245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Dental school","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_school"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Proactivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactivity"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"}]}
