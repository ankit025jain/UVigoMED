{"id":86096,"title":"The effect of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation combined with tracheal gas insufflation on extravascular lung water in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a randomized, crossover, physiologic study.","abstract":"High-frequency oscillation combined with tracheal gas insufflation (HFO-TGI) improves oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are limited physiologic data regarding the effects of HFO-TGI on hemodynamics and pulmonary edema during ARDS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HFO-TGI on extravascular lung water (EVLW).We conducted a prospective, randomized, crossover study. Consecutive eligible patients with ARDS received sessions of conventional mechanical ventilation with recruitment maneuvers (RMs), followed by HFO-TGI with RMs, or vice versa. Each ventilatory technique was administered for 8 hours. The order of administration was randomly assigned. Arterial/central venous blood gas analysis and measurement of hemodynamic parameters and EVLW were performed at baseline and after each 8-hour period using the single-indicator thermodilution technique.Twelve patients received 32 sessions. Pao2/fraction of inspired oxygen and respiratory system compliance were higher (P<.001 for both), whereas extravascular lung water index to predicted body weight and oxygenation index were lower (P=.021 and .029, respectively) in HFO-TGI compared with conventional mechanical ventilation. There was a significant correlation between Pao2/fraction of inspired oxygen improvement and extravascular lung water index drop during HFO-TGI (Rs=-0.452, P=.009).High-frequency oscillation combined with tracheal gas insufflation improves gas exchange and lung mechanics in ARDS and potentially attenuates EVLW accumulation.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814973","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.791849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.778612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Gas exchange","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_exchange"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Arterial blood gas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood_gas"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.69057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Infant respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.597689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.597633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.532844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Invertebrate trachea","weight":0.15882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Compliance (physiology)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(physiology)"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
