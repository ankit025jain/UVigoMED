{"id":12498,"title":"Isolated limb infusion as a model to test new agents to treat metastatic melanoma.","abstract":"The limb model of in-transit disease can expand our understanding of treating melanoma because of the ease of obtaining tissue biopsies for correlative studies and the availability of preclinical animal models that allow validation of novel therapeutic strategies. This review will focus on regional therapy for in-transit melanoma as a platform to investigate novel therapeutic approaches to improve regional disease control, and help us develop insights to more rationally design systemic therapy trials.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522940","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.60838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.337024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Systemic therapy","weight":0.0639325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_therapy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0151828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
