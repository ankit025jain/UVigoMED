{"id":42362,"title":"Sequential gastroenteritis episodes caused by 2 norovirus genotypes.","abstract":"We investigated sequential episodes of acute norovirus gastroenteritis in a young child within an 11-month period. The infections were caused by 2 distinct genotypes (GII.4 and GII.6). Failure to achieve cross-protective immunity was linked to absence of an enduring and cross-reactive mucosal immune response, a critical consideration for vaccine design.
