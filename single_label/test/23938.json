{"id":23938,"title":"Infective endocarditis and meningitis due to Scedosporium prolificans in a renal transplant recipient.","abstract":"Scedosporium prolificans is a ubiquitous filamentous fungi that may cause disseminated diseases in neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. We report a fatal case of renal transplant recipient who developed both infective endocarditis and meningitis due to S.Â prolificans during treatment with micafungin and itraconazole for chronic necrotizing aspergillosis. Breakthrough Scedosporium infection should be considered among differential diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases in patients with renal transplant recipients receiving antifungal agents.
