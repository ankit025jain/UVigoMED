{"id":81853,"title":"Upper incisors' positions after extraction.","abstract":"The aim of this research was to verify the amount of horizontal and vertical movement and incisor inclination of upper incisors and correlate these with Edgewise and Alexander brackets use and the presence of overbite during anterior retraction in sliding mechanics. The sample was composed of 40 adult patients divided into 2 groups, treated with Edgewise and Alexander brackets (20 each) subdivided in 2 groups (10 each), according to the presence or absence of deep bite. Treatment consisted of 4 extraction cases with sliding mechanics with the 2 different brackets. Pre- and post-treatment cephalograms were measured and the values of interest submitted to descriptive statistical analysis, ANOVA at 5%, the Tukey test and Pearson's correlation. Upper incisor retraction was not related to the brackets used nor to the presence of deep bite, though lingual tipping was greater when Edgewise brackets were used and deep bite was absent. No statistically significant differences in upper incisor vertical movements were observed and no correlation was determined between upper incisor intrusion and lower incisor labial tipping in overbite correction or in upper incisor retraction and lower incisor labial tipping for overjet correction. Bracket prescription and its interaction with deep bite were significant and Edgewise brackets without deep bite showed the worst inclination control. It was concluded that bracket prescriptions are important to increase control of sliding mechanics.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812742","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.429166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.425705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"John Tukey","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Fault (geology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Landslide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide"},{"name":"Labial consonant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Intrusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Bracket (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(band)"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Bracket (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(architecture)"},{"name":"Edgewise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgewise"},{"name":"Charles Paul Alexander","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Paul_Alexander"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Bracket","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
