{"id":87504,"title":"Cognitive overload? An exploration of the potential impact of cognitive functioning in discrete choice experiments with older people in health care.","abstract":"This exploratory study sought to investigate the effect of cognitive functioning on the consistency of individual responses to a discrete choice experiment (DCE) study conducted exclusively with older people.A DCE to investigate preferences for multidisciplinary rehabilitation was administered to a consenting sample of older patients (aged 65 years and older) after surgery to repair a fractured hip (N = 84). Conditional logit, mixed logit, heteroscedastic conditional logit, and generalized multinomial logit regression models were used to analyze the DCE data and to explore the relationship between the level of cognitive functioning (specifically the absence or presence of mild cognitive impairment as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination) and preference and scale heterogeneity.Both the heteroscedastic conditional logit and generalized multinomial logit models indicated that the presence of mild cognitive impairment did not have a significant effect on the consistency of responses to the DCE.This study provides important preliminary evidence relating to the effect of mild cognitive impairment on DCE responses for older people. It is important that further research be conducted in larger samples and more diverse populations to further substantiate the findings from this exploratory study and to assess the practicality and validity of the DCE approach with populations of older people.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128060","annotations":[{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.668446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.561443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.530277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Heteroscedasticity","weight":0.400759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.333738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Logit","weight":0.307942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.292974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Discrete choice","weight":0.258022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_choice"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mild cognitive impairment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Multinomial distribution","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Staatsexamen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatsexamen"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Discrete probability distribution","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_probability_distribution"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Conditional probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability"},{"name":"Cognitive load","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load"}]}
