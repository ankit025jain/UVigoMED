{"id":78275,"title":"[Background factors in the detection of drug-resistant bacteria in adult patients with acute rhinosinusitis].","abstract":"In the treatment of adult patients with acute rhinosinusitis, it has been assumed that subjects over 65 years of age or living with children attending a day nursery, are at higher risk for infection with drug-resistant bacteria. However there are few reports which have discussed the relationship between those risk factors and adult patients with acute rhinosinusitis. I investigated the association between adult patients with acute rhinosinusitis living with children attending a day nursery and gender, ages, and frequency of detection of drug-resistant bacteria. From 2010 to 2012, a total of 598 adult patients with acute rhinosinusitis were enrolled. The majority of the study subjects were women, and the largest 10-year age group was 30-39 years. By sex, a greater proportion of the female subjects than the male subjects lived with children attending a day nursery. By age, the proportion of subjects who lived with children attending a day nursery was significantly higher in the 30-39-year age group than other age groups. Drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant Haemophilus influenzae were detected at significantly higher rates in subjects with children attending a day nursery than in those without. There were no significant difference in drug-resistant bacteria detection between subjects over 65 years of age, and under 65 years. These findings suggested that living with children attending a day nursery is a risk factor and source of infection by drug-resistant organisms that may cause intra-familial infections of adult patients with acute rhinosinusitis. These results suggested we must ask adult patients with acute rhinosinusitis whether they are living with children attending a day nursery or not, when we plan their treatment strategy.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720161","annotations":[{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.733423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.645335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.533358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.461225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Day care","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_care"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.10821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0633437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
