{"id":47729,"title":"Family case of achalasia cardia: case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Achalasia cardia is an idiopathic disease that occurs as a result of inflammation and degeneration of myenteric plexi leading to the loss of postganglionic inhibitory neurons required for relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and peristalsis of the esophagus. The main symptoms of achalasia are dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain and weight loss. At present, there are three main hypotheses regarding etiology of achalasia cardia which are under consideration, these are genetic, infectious and autoimmune. Genetic theory is one of the most widely discussed. Case report given below represents an inheritable case of achalasia cardia which was not diagnosed for a long time in an 81-year-old woman and her 58-year-old daughter.
