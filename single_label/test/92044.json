{"id":92044,"title":"[Early results after surgical treatment of femoral neck fractures with total cementless hip arthroplasty].","abstract":"The aim of the study was to assess early results after the treatment of femoral neck fractures with the cementless hip arthroplasty as well as complications after the earlier fixation of these fractures in patients aged 55-70 years.40 cementless hip arthroplasty procedures with the use of Bicontact S endoprosthesis were performed, including 33 due to the femoral neck Garden III and IV type fractures, 7 due to the destabilization of the earlier performed bone fixation with DHS (Dynamic Hip Screw) or the nonunion after the fracture fixation. Postoperative complications as well as early clinical and radiological results were assessed. Outpatient follow-up examinations assessed patients using Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), to estimate their quality of life and the level of contentment.The total cementless hip arthroplasty with the use of Bicontact endoprosthesis allows to achieve very good early clinical results in patients who have undergone the surgical procedure due to the femoral neck fracture and good clinical results in patients who have undergone this surgery because of complications after the fixation of fractures. In the examined group of patients early radiological results were good.Based on the very good and good early results of clinical trials can be assumed that the total cementless hip arthroplasty will be an effective and recommended method of treatment of femoral neck fractures and complications after the earlier fixation of these fractures in patients aged 55 to 70 years, but this requires further, long-term observation. Total hip arthroplasty, not the fixation, should be more often considered as a primary care management of fractures of this type because it allows for a pain-free walking faster and faster return to pre-injury functioning.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455829","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.541438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.361341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.342331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.194686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"United States Department of Health and Human Services","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0480512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"United States Department of Homeland Security","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Destabilisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destabilisation"},{"name":"Dynamic (record label)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_(record_label)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Contentment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contentment"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Chronic care management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_care_management"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"}]}
