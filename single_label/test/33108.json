{"id":33108,"title":"The Roberts syndrome: a case report of an infant with valvular aortic stenosis and mutation in ESCO2.","abstract":"Roberts syndrome, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive group of disorders, is a rare syndrome characterized with symmetrical extremity defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and prenatal and postnatal growth retardation. Here, we present a case of Roberts Syndrome brought to the clinic with diarrhoea and multiple abnormalities, that had tetra phocomelia, growth and developmental retardation, abnormality of complete cleft lip-palate accompanied with Aortic stenosis and PDA, and in which cytogenetic analysis identified premature centromere separation. Mutation analysis of ESCO2 revealed a splice site mutation [c.1131+1G>A] in intron 6 in homozygous status in the patient and heterozygous status in the parents. Our case is the first Robert- Syndrome with valvular aortic stenosis in the literature, to the best of our knowledge.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864645","annotations":[{"name":"Intron","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.839122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.75686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.75686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.691357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.643209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.566462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.518284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.491298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Roberts syndrome","weight":0.459824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_syndrome"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.362412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Aortic valve stenosis","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_stenosis"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Delayed milestone","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_milestone"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Splice site mutation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splice_site_mutation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
