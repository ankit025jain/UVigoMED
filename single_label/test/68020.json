{"id":68020,"title":"Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis with carcinoma in situ in the ureter.","abstract":"Primary epithelial tumor of the renal pelvis is rare and only 100 cases are reported in the literature [1]. Histological examination of the tumor showed glands, cysts, and papillae lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium with hyperchromatic nuclei. Scattered signet ring-type cells were also seen floating in large pools of extracellular mucin. Sections from the ureter showed a component of adenocarcinoma in situ. No invasive tumor was identified in ureteric tissue. One case was reported with carcinoma in situ of the ureter (2). Immunohistochemically: The tumor showed positivity for CK7, CK20, CK8/18, GATA-3, MSH-2, MSH-6, MLH-1, Ber-EP4, and S-100-P with focal positivity for CDX-2, weak positivity for PMS-2 and negativity in TTF-1 and Her-2. Molecular pathological analysis revealed microsatellite stability and without mutation in K-ras-gene. Thus, a diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis with in situ adenocarcinoma of the ureter was made.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565683","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.872173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma in situ","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma_in_situ"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.662928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.559356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.289089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.274422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.247594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Melanocyte-stimulating hormone","weight":0.1216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.0639958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"NK2 homeobox 1","weight":0.0550013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK2_homeobox_1"},{"name":"Columnar","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar"},{"name":"Renal pelvis","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_pelvis"},{"name":"CDX2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDX2"},{"name":"Columnar epithelial cell","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Signet ring","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
