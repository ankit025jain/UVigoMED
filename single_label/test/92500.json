{"id":92500,"title":"Does ultrasound-scored synovitis depend on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the pharmacokinetics of s.c. anti-TNF agents on the grade of US-detected synovitis in RA patients.Fifty RA patients were prospectively recruited from the Biologic Therapy Unit of our hospital. Inclusion criteria were being in treatment with s.c. anti-TNF agents and having had neither changes in therapy nor local corticosteroid injections in the previous 3 months. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory [28-joint DAS (DAS28) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)] and US assessment at two time points, i.e. at peak plasma drug concentration and at trough plasma drug concentration. US assessments were performed blindly to the anti-TNF agent, the administration time and the clinical and laboratory data. Twenty-eight joints were investigated for the presence and grade (0-3) of B-mode synovitis and synovial power Doppler signal. Global indices for B-mode synovitis (BSI) and Doppler synovitis (DSI) were calculated for 12 joints and for wrist-hand-ankle-foot joints. B-mode US remission was defined as a BSI <1 and Doppler US remission as a DSI <1.There were no significant differences between the clinical, laboratory and B-mode and Doppler US parameters at peak time and trough time (P = 0.132-0.986). There were no significant differences between the proportion of patients with active disease and those in remission according to DAS28, SDAI, B-mode US and Doppler US at peak time and trough time assessments (P = 0.070-1).Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24939676","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.88253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.68133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.666265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.637759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.636446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.475932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.33407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.175555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"ISO 10303-22","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-22"},{"name":"Synovitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Prime time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time"},{"name":"1320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1320"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Digital Signal Interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signal_Interface"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"BSI Group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSI_Group"},{"name":"Trough (meteorology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)"}]}
