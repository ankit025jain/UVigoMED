{"id":55119,"title":"Tamoxifen toxicity in cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells is mediated by concurrent regulated cell death mechanisms.","abstract":"To evaluate the mechanism of tamoxifen-induced cell death in human cultured RPE cells, and to investigate concurrent cell death mechanisms including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis.Human RPE cells were cultured until confluence and treated with tamoxifen; cell death was measured by detecting LDH release. Tamoxifen-induced cell death was further confirmed by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and annexin V staining. Lysosomal destabilization was assessed using lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) and acridine orange staining. The roles of lysosomal enzymes cathepsin B and L were examined by blocking their activity. Caspase activity was evaluated by caspase-1, -3, -8, and -9 specific inhibition. Cells were primed with IL-1? and treated with tamoxifen; mature IL-1? production was quantified via ELISA. Caspase activity was verified with the fluorochrome-labeled inhibitor of caspases (FLICA) probe specific for each caspase. Regulated cell necrosis or necroptosis was examined with 7-AAD and inhibition of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) kinase using necrostatin-1 (Nec-1).Cell death occurred within 2 hours of tamoxifen treatment of confluent RPE cells and was accompanied by lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Blockade of cathepsin B and L activity led to a significant decrease in cell death, indicating that lysosomal destabilization and cathepsin release occur prior to regulated cell death. Tamoxifen-induced toxicity was shown to occur through both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death pathways. Treatment of RPE cells with caspase inhibitors and Nec-1 resulted in a near complete rescue from cell death.Tamoxifen-induced cell death occurs through concurrent regulated cell death mechanisms. Simultaneous inhibition of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death pathways is required to protect cells from tamoxifen. Inhibition of upstream activators, such as the cathepsins, may represent a novel approach to block multiple cell death pathways.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24994868","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.928136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.69692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Pyroptosis","weight":0.673109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroptosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.493754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cathepsin","weight":0.41249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathepsin"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.349403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.30529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.267159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.190433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.16612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.127354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Annexin A5","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin_A5"},{"name":"Cathepsin B","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathepsin_B"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Orange (fruit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"}]}
