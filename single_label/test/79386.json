{"id":79386,"title":"Total laryngeal transplant explanted: 14 years of lessons learned.","abstract":"In 1998, the first successful total laryngeal transplant was performed. Outstanding voice quality and swallowing function were achieved, and over the subsequent 14 years, much was learned about tolerance of a transplanted larynx. After approximately a decade, a slowly progressive, chronic rejection process gradually rendered the organ nonfunctional, and the patient and his providers deemed him appropriate for explantation. This is a report of the clinical indications and outcome surrounding the explantation of the first successful total laryngeal transplant.
