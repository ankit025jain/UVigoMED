{"id":22179,"title":"The role of besifloxacin in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.","abstract":"To evaluate the role of besifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis treatment.Searches were made on MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE (January 2007 to January 2014) using the terms besifloxacin and Besivance. References from these publications were reviewed for additional resources. Additional information was collected from Bausch & Lomb, the manufacturer of Besivance; www.clinicaltrials.gov; and American Academy of Ophthalmology.English-language documents were reviewed for pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety, with priority on clinical trials.Three large randomized controlled clinical trials established the safety and efficacy of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% compared with placebo or active comparator (moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%) given 3 times a day for 5 days for acute bacterial conjunctivitis (BC) treatment. Compared with placebo, besifloxacin had clinically superior bacterial eradication rates and was noninferior to moxifloxacin. Besifloxacin was compared with placebo in 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, dosed twice a day for 3 days. Superior efficacy was seen compared with placebo, which supports the shorter dosing schedule. Ophthalmic besifloxacin is well tolerated; the most common adverse effect (conjunctival redness) occurred in 2% of patients. Adverse effects in 1% to 2% of patients included blurred vision, eye pain, eye irritation, eye pruritus, and headache.Besifloxacin 0.6% ophthalmic suspension 3 times a day for 5 days is safe and effective for BC. Twice-a-day dosing for 3 days was also effective-a simplified regimen compared with other fluoroquinolones. Disadvantages include price and lack of a generic. Further evaluation is needed to evaluate comparative efficacy among other ocular fluoroquinolones and unlabeled uses.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566460","annotations":[{"name":"Moxifloxacin","weight":0.878497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxifloxacin"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.742266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.62966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blurred vision","weight":0.575423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.328679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.162763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"American Academy of Ophthalmology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Ophthalmology"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"ClinicalTrials.gov","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClinicalTrials.gov"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
