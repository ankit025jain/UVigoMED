{"id":22481,"title":"Protective effect of taraxasterol on acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice.","abstract":"Taraxasterol, a pentacyclic-triterpene isolated from Taraxacum officinale, has been reported to have potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of taraxasterol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice acute lung injury has not been investigated. The aims of this study were to investigate whether taraxasterol could ameliorate the inflammation response in LPS-induced acute lung injury and to clarify the possible mechanism. Male BALB/c mice were pretreated with taraxasterol 1h before intranasal instillation of LPS. 7h after LPS administration, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) in lung tissues, lung wet/dry ratio and inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were detected. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1? (IL-1?) in the BALF were measured by ELISA. The extent of phosphorylation of I?B-?, p65 NF-?B, p46-p54 JNK, p42-p44 ERK, and p38 were determined by western blotting. The results showed that taraxasterol attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), lung wet/dry ratio, and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1? (IL-1?) in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, western blotting results showed that taraxasterol inhibited the phosphorylation of I?B-?, p65 NF-?B, p46-p54 JNK, p42-p44 ERK, and p38 caused by LPS. Our data suggest that anti-inflammatory effects of taraxasterol against the LPS-induced ALI may be due to its ability of inhibition of the NF-?B and MAPK signaling pathways.
