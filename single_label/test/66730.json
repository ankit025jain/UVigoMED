{"id":66730,"title":"Gleason 6 prostate cancer: serious malignancy or toothless lion?","abstract":"Autopsy studies of men without known prostate cancer suggest that a substantial reservoir of prostate cancer that does not cause symptoms or death exists within the population. The majority of these cancers are Gleason 6 tumors and are frequently detected by prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening.There is strong evidence from longitudinal cohort studies of men with both treated and untreated Gleason 6 prostate cancer to suggest that Gleason 6 disease, when not associated with higher-grade cancer, virtually never demonstrates the ability to metastasize and thus represents an indolent entity that does not require treatment. Whether Gleason 6 has a propensity to progress to higher-grade cancer is still under investigation. Because the term \"cancer\" has historically been used to represent a disease state that leads to progressive illness that is uniformly fatal without treatment, we believe Gleason 6 disease should not be labeled with this term. Our challenge now is to develop the technology to differentiate true Gleason 6 disease from the higher grades of dysplasia with which it can be associated.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683714","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.693372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.67013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.329207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Prostate cancer screening","weight":0.144571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer_screening"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Progressive illness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_illness"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Progressivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"},{"name":"Lion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
