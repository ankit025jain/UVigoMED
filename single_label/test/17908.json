{"id":17908,"title":"Differences in immune cell function between tuberculosis positive and negative Asian elephants.","abstract":"Tuberculosis is an important health concern for Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) populations worldwide, however, mechanisms underlying susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis are unknown. Proliferative responses assessed via brominated uridine incorporation and cytokine expression measured by real-time RT-PCR were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from 8 tuberculosis negative and 8 positive Asian elephants. Cultures were stimulated with Mycobacterium bovis purified protein derivative (PPD-B), M. tuberculosis culture filtrate protein (CFP)-10, and Mycobacterium avium PPD (PPD-A). Following stimulation with PPD-B, proliferation was higher (? = 0.005) in positive samples; no significant differences were detected following CFP-10 or PPD-A stimulation. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-12, and interferon (IFN)-? expression was greater in samples from positive elephants following stimulation with PPD-B (? = 0.025) and CFP-10 (? = 0.025 TNF-? and IL-12; ? = 0.005 IFN-?). Stimulation with PPD-A also produced enhanced IL-12 expression in positive samples (? = 0.025). Findings suggested that differences in immune cell function exist between tuberculosis positive and negative elephants. Proliferative responses and expression of TNF-?, IL-12, and IFN-? in response to stimulation with PPD-B and CFP-10 differ between tuberculosis positive and negative elephants, suggesting these parameters may be important to tuberculosis immunopathogenesis in this species.
