{"id":55357,"title":"Morphological and electrophysiological outcome in prospective intravitreal bevacizumab treatment of macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion.","abstract":"To evaluate intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) treatment in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinography (ERG).Twenty-two CRVO patients were treated with IVB injections and followed for 1 year. Morphological effect of treatment was observed with fluorescent angiography and OCT. Functional effect was followed with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and ERG: combined rod-cone response of the standard full-field ERG (dark adapted 3.0 ERG), photopic negative response (PhNR), and pattern ERG (PERG).Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved by 18.2 letters after 6 months (p ? 0.001) and additional 4.7 letters by the 12th month (p ? 0.001). The central retinal thickness of 829.8 ± 256.7 ?m decreased to 398.8 ± 230 ?m (p ? 0.001) after 6 months and to 303.7 ± 128.9 ?m during the following 6 months (p ? 0.001). The total macular volume (14.4 ± 4.2 mm(3)) decreased to 9.6 ± 3.2 mm(3) and 8.5 ± 2.0 mm(3) after 6 months and 1 year of treatment, respectively (p ? 0.001). Electrophysiological measures improved significantly after 6 months and 1 year of treatment: the a-wave implicit time of dark adapted 3.0 ERG from 25.6 ± 2.3 to 24.1 ± 2.1 and 24.1 ± 2.0 ms (p ? 0.01); the PhNR from -5.9 ± 6.6 to -9.4 ± 6.1 and -10.4 ± 4.6 µV (p ? 0.05); the PERG P50 amplitude from 0.2 ± 0.3 to 0.9 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0.6 µV (p ? 0.001); and N95 amplitude from 0.4 ± 0.6 to 1.2 ± 0.9 and 1.6 ± 0.9 µV (p ? 0.001).Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) treatment of macular edema due to CRVO improved standard morphological measures and the electrophysiological function of outer and inner retinal layers, which was most evident in central retina.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Eye
