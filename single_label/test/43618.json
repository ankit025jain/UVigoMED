{"id":43618,"title":"Modern GERD treatment: feasibility of minimally invasive esophageal sphincter augmentation.","abstract":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common chronic disease requiring adequate treatment since it represents one major cause of development of Barrett's esophagus and eventually carcinoma. Novel laparoscopic magnetic sphincter augmentation for GERD was evaluated prospectively.A total of 23 patients with GERD underwent minimally invasive implantation of LINX™ Reflux Management System. Primary outcome measures were overall feasibility, short-term procedure safety and efficacy. Secondary GERD-related quality of life was assessed.All implantations were performed without serious adverse events. A significant decrease in all major GERD complaints were found: heartburn: 96%-22% (p<0.001); bloating: 70%-30% (p=0.006); respiratory complaints: 57%-17% (p=0.039); sleep disturbance: 65%-4% (p<0.001). A four-week follow-up reduction of ?50% of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) dose was achieved in over 80% of patients. Self-limiting difficulty in swallowing was found in 70% within four weeks. One patient required for endoscopic dilation. GERD-related quality of life improved significantly.LINX™ implantation is a standardized, technically simple, safe and well-tolerated expeditious procedure.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778041","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Heartburn","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bloating","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloating"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.771872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.570961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.453619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.420466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.355612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.245507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
