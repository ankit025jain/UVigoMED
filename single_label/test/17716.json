{"id":17716,"title":"Pitfalls in the management of sepsis in Thailand.","abstract":"Septicemia is a major cause of death for patients in the intensive care unit. Patient care is not only a function of doctors or nurses but also requires teamwork from all healthcare professionals. Starting from the screening of the patient in the emergency room, management of these patients includes; early antimicrobial therapy, controlling the source of the infection, initiating hemodynamic therapy, admitting the patient to the intensive care unit, monitoring and surveillance for complications of mechanical ventilation and multiple organ failure. Managing all of these require the expertise of multidisciplinary physicians. Lack of understanding and knowledge in the management of clinical practices can predispose the patient to errors in the treatment of patients here, in Thailand. This present guideline is acceptable as an international standard and is the current practice of the Faculty of Medicine, Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University. This is an example of the multidisciplinary management of septicemia patients in a university hospital in Thailand as set by international standards.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855855","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.822937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.751478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.651744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.583332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.554069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.540631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.497197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.405922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.322254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"University","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.2,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.119278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.030717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Organ failure","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_failure"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
