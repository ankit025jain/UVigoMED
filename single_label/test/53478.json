{"id":53478,"title":"Lateralization of ovarian follicles.","abstract":"To evaluate a possible lateralization of antral follicle count (AFC) based on the finding that endometriosis, if present, is more commonly found in the left hemipelvis.We evaluated the records of 6,617 baseline ultrasounds conducted at our Reproductive Center between 2007 and 2011 in a university teaching hospital setting. We included all ultrasounds with an AFC of 1 or greater and excluded those with incomplete documentation or with ovarian cyst, including endometriotic cysts (n = 909). The main outcome measure was the comparison of the number of antral follicles between the right and left ovary.The number of antral follicles in the right ovary (median 18, range 15-22) was significantly higher than in the left ovary (median 16, range 13-20) among women with polycystic ovaries (PCO, AFC ?24). Similarly, the number of antral follicles in the right ovary (median 8, range 6-10) was significantly higher than in the left ovary (median 7, range 5-9) in women with no PCO but normal ovarian reserve (AFC 10-23).In women with PCO and non-PCO with normal ovarian reserve, the right ovary contains a higher number of antral follicles than the left ovary.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513727","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Ovarian cyst","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cyst"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.715613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.677139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.547208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Antral follicle count","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antral_follicle_count"},{"name":"Ovarian reserve","weight":0.308015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_reserve"},{"name":"Antral follicle","weight":0.115188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antral_follicle"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.0204144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"1522","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1522"},{"name":"1320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1320"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"909","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909"},{"name":"1023","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1023"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Lateralization of brain function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function"},{"name":"Follicular antrum","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_antrum"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"}]}
