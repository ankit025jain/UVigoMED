{"id":92482,"title":"Triple fracture during rehabilitation after revision total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"The incidence of periprosthetic fractures after knee-joint implant revisions is increasing in prevalence. We present a method of treatment for a patient who sustained a triple fracture--a periprosthetic femur fracture, a patella fracture, and a tibial shaft fracture.The femoral fracture was treated with a specially designed intramedullary nail, the patella fracture with a figure-of-eight suture, and the tibial shaft fracture by a minimal-invasive plate osteosynthesis using a percutaneous plating technique.Osseous consolidation was confirmed, and the patient presented a satisfying range of movement under full-weight-bearing conditions after mobilisation.Simultaneous multiple periprosthetic fractures are a special challenge, and in situ coupling of the endoprosthesis with a slotted hollow nail presents a valuable option for the treatment.Level V, Expert opinion.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23716014","annotations":[{"name":"Femoral fracture","weight":0.910201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.877761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.758055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.656922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.597689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patella fracture","weight":0.488884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella_fracture"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.41009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Body of tibia","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_tibia"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
