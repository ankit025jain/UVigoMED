{"id":30943,"title":"[Pharmacological activity of runihol and S-adenosyl-L-methionine in rats with experimental liver damage by reserve antituberculosis drugs].","abstract":"The hepatoprotective action of runihol and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (ademethionine) has been studied in a group of 47 white outbred male rats with model liver injury induced by reserve antituberculosis drugs (PAS, prothionamide, cycloserine). The ability of test drugs to correct structural and functional liver disorders is established. Both runihol and ademethionine favored decrease in the signs of structural and functional liver disorders induced by reserve antituberculosis drugs, Showing mixed type of action, the test drugs promoted recovery of the liver parenchyma and reduced manifestations of hepatocyte dystrophy to the same extent, without manifestations of necrobiotic processes and a mononuclear infiltration.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432566","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.781451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.511198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.0690403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cycloserine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloserine"},{"name":"Prothionamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothionamide"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Malaysian_Islamic_Party"},{"name":"Inbreeding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
