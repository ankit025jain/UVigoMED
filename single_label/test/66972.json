{"id":66972,"title":"Alternative sexualities: implications for the urologist.","abstract":"Urologists routinely deal with sensitive issues of urinary function as well as sexuality in daily practice. Even experienced urologists may encounter patients who engage in sexual practices that are novel, unknown, or perhaps disturbing to the provider. This primer will serve as an introduction to sexual practices and lifestyle choices that may be foreign to many practicing urologists. It is by no means an exhaustive description of alternative sexualities, but will hopefully serve as a useful introduction to the topic and will enhance the ability of providers to care for, or appropriately refer, patients whose sexual practices and lifestyles may differ from their own.
