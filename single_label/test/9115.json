{"id":9115,"title":"Corneal wound healing promoted by 3 blood derivatives: an in vitro and in vivo comparative study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the effect on corneal wound healing of 3 differently manufactured blood derivatives [autologous serum (AS), platelet-rich plasma, and serum derived from plasma rich in growth factors (s-PRGF)].Scratch wound-healing assays were performed on rabbit primary corneal epithelial cultures and human corneal epithelial cells. Additionally, mechanical debridement of rabbit corneal epithelium was performed. Wound-healing progression was assessed by measuring the denuded areas remaining over time after treatment with each of the 3 blood derivatives or a control treatment.In vitro data show statistically significant differences in the healing process with all the derivatives compared with the control, but 2 of them (AS and s-PRGF) induced markedly faster wound healing. In contrast, although the mean time required to complete in vivo reepithelization was similar to that of AS and s-PRGF treatment, only wounds treated with s-PRGF were significantly smaller in size from 2.5 days onward with respect to the control treatment.All 3 blood derivatives studied are promoters of corneal reepithelization. However, the corneal wound-healing progresses differently with each derivative, being faster in vitro under AS and s-PRGF treatment and producing in vivo the greatest decrease in wound size under s-PRGF treatment. These findings highlight that the manufacturing process of the blood derivatives may modulate the efficacy of the final product.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727633","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.763952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.172396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.093262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Corneal epithelium","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_epithelium"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Denudation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denudation"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
