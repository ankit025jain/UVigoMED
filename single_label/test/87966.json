{"id":87966,"title":"Ipsilateral intertrochantric and femoral head fracture without dislocation of the hip. Potentially misleading radiograph: a case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Traumatic femoral head fracture without dislocation with ipsilateral intertrochanteric fracture is an extremely rare injury and has not been reported in the literature.We reported a case of simultaneous ipsilateral femoral head and intertrochantric fracture without dislocation of the hip in a 74-year-old woman. The patient presented with a history of road traffic accident. Radiographs and computerised tomography scans revealed a right intertrochantric fracture and femoral head fracture without dislocation of the hip.The case was managed by uncemented modular bipolar arthroplasty using LINK reconstruction prosthesis. In the case report we described this unusual pattern, mechanism of injury, and management of such cases.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24940941","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.820631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.747018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.619195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.535623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.313905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.304438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.195061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0677712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"LINK (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINK_(UK)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
