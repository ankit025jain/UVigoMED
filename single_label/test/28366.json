{"id":28366,"title":"Sudden cardiac death & the Reverse Dodo Verdict.","abstract":"Adverse effects of treatment on cardiac QT intervals were first reported 50 years ago. A clear link to sudden death was established, but the problem remained relatively unknown. The issue of treatment related effects on the heart, and the contribution this might make to sudden cardiac deaths in general, came more clearly into focus 20 years ago, linked to regulatory actions. In an era of polypharmacy, and mixing of prescribed and non-prescribed pharmacologically active agents it is now becoming increasingly clear that unanticipated cardiac effects may be common and a significant cause of mortality. There is likely underreporting and also underdiagnosis, as recognition requires a timely ECG. This paper proposes two methods to handle the problem.
