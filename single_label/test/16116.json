{"id":16116,"title":"Acinetobacter sp. isolates from emergency departments in two hospitals of South Korea.","abstract":"A total of 114 Acinetobacter sp. isolates were collected from patients in the emergency departments (EDs) of two Korean hospitals. Most isolates belonged to the Acinetobacter baumannii complex (105 isolates, 92.1?%). Imipenem resistance was found in 39 isolates (34.2?%) of the Acinetobacter sp. isolates, and 6 colistin-resistant isolates were also identified. Species distribution and antimicrobial-resistance rates were different between the two hospitals. In addition, two main clones were identified in the imipenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates from hospital B, but very diverse and novel genotypes were found in those from hospital A. Many Acinetobacter sp. isolates, including the imipenem-resistant A. baumannii, are considered to be associated with the community. The evidence of high antimicrobial resistance and different features in these Acinetobacter sp. isolates between the two EDs suggests the need for continuous testing to monitor changes in epidemiology.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25062943","annotations":[{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.730912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.365799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.228919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Species distribution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution"}]}
