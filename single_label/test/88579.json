{"id":88579,"title":"[Radiofrequency coblation for treatment of abnormal sensation of throat induced by the hypertrophy of lingual tonsil].","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of radiofrequency coblation surgery for treatment of abnormal sensation of throat induced by the hypertrophy of lingual tonsil.Three hundred and seven patients affected by abnormal sensation of throat induced by the hypertrophy of lingual tonsil were enrolled. Radiofrequency coblation was performed on all patients under nasal endoscopy. A comprehensive statistics were obtained from all the participants regarding the recovery of wound surface, postoperative pain, intra and postoperative bleeding and the effects of the procedure.The VAS score of abnormal sensation of throat was reduced from (9.3 +/- 0.6) to (3.7 +/- 2.4) (P<0.05) after the operation. 84.4% of the abnormal sensation dis appeared, no recurrence within six month; 6.8% of the abnormal sensation largely reduced within six month; 4.6% of the abnormal sensation reduced within six month. There was no significant postoperative pain. 3.6% (11/307) of patients experienced postoperative hemorrhage. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 36 months, there was no recurrence.Radiofrequency coblation is a useful surgical technique, as effective as,or even superior to,other surgical techniques when dealing with patients suffering from abnormal sensation of throat induced by the hypertrophy of lingual tonsil with potentially fewer adverse effects and subsequently improved quality of life for patients.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826457","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.866535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tonsil","weight":0.722255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsil"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.64282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.624916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.321688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.25757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0583839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Lingual tonsils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingual_tonsils"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Rhinoscope","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoscope"}]}
