{"id":44897,"title":"[Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of NSAIDs].","abstract":"All NSAIDs may induce cardiotoxicity. In this respect naproxen is relatively the safest choice. Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2-inhibitors (coxibs) are at least as effective in preventing clinically relevant gastrointestinal toxicity as non-selective NSAIDs plus a protonpump inhibitor (PPI). Non-selective NSAIDs plus a PPI are more effective in prevention of dyspepsia than coxibs. After a serious gastrointestinal complication while using NSAIDs, in principal the patient should no longer use NSAIDs. If needed, a coxib plus a PPI is the first choice.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713339","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Naproxen","weight":0.8314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen"},{"name":"COX-2 inhibitor","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2_inhibitor"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.757355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.468758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiotoxicity","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotoxicity"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0342353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"}]}
