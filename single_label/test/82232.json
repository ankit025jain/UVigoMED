{"id":82232,"title":"Cytokines and chemokines are differentially expressed in patients with periodontitis: possible role for TGF-?1 as a marker for disease progression.","abstract":"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of periodontal tissue ultimately leading to bone destruction and has been associated with other inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Attachment loss of periodontal tissue is primarily caused by host cell-derived immune responses against subgingival biofilm. The aim of the present study was to determine the cytokine profile in serum, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) patients with periodontitis and healthy controls. We show that periodontitis patients exhibit higher numbers of periodontal pathogens and their immune responses are significantly altered. The levels of IL-6 in saliva and GCF were significantly suppressed, and while CXCL8 was not altered in serum, its expression levels were significantly suppressed in saliva and elevated in GCF. The T-cell-derived cytokine IL-2 did not differ between patients and controls in serum and saliva, but there was a significant suppression in GCF of patients. Interestingly, TGF-?1 levels were significantly elevated in serum, saliva and GCF in patients compared to controls. Furthermore, by using cultured gingival fibroblasts stimulated with wild type and proteinase mutant strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, we show that the suppression of CXCL8 and IL-6, and the induction of TGF-?1 is primarily mediated by the proteolytic activity of lysine-specific proteinases. These results indicate that P. gingivalis is a major contributor to the altered immune responses and the pathology of periodontitis. Furthermore, the ease of sampling and analyzing cytokine expression profiles, including TGF-?1, in saliva and GCF may serve to predict the progression of periodontitis and associated systemic inflammatory diseases.
