{"id":52956,"title":"Relationship of vascular complications and exenatide therapy failure in type 2 diabetic patients.","abstract":"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic that acts through glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor accepted as a successful novel glucose-lowering agent in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to explore the possible predictive factors for exenatide efficacy among baseline characteristics of type 2 diabetic patients. We observed basic anthropometric measurements, laboratory findings and diabetic complications in ninety-one type 2 diabetic patients starting exenatide therapy. There were forty-six (50.5%) male and forty-five (49.5%) female patients, median age 58 (31-76) years, body mass index 38.95 +/- 4.35 kg/m2, duration of diabetes 10 (1-30) years and HbAlc level 8.3 +/- 1.4%. Thirty (33%) patients stopped therapy because of glycemic dysregulation during 105 (21-390) days on therapy. These patients differed statistically significantly from those that continued therapy according to the following seven variables: higher fasting glucose blood concentration (11.5 mmol/L (5.6-20) vs. 10.2 mmol/L (5-19), higher serum creatinine concentration (93 micromol/L (44-149) vs. 72 micromol/L (44-124), more frequent diabetic complications including retinopathy (56.7% vs. 27.9%), chronic kidney disease (43.7% vs. 24.7%), coronary artery disease (53.3% vs. 31.1%) and peripheral artery disease (60% vs. 34.4%), and less often concomitant metformin and exenatide therapy (62% vs. 82%). Bivariate logistic regression identified peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, retinopathy, and chronic kidney disease as risk factors for glycemic dysregulation on exenatide therapy. We found reasonable to consider that a higher rate of microvascular and macrovascular complications may indicate failure of exenatide therapy in the majority of patients.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558765","annotations":[{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.832399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.694294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.661482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Exenatide","weight":0.368056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exenatide"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.219913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Incretin","weight":0.17995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incretin"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.154458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
