{"id":3243,"title":"[The evaluation and comparative characteristic of detection of clone of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria on reticulocytes using the technique of flow cytometry].","abstract":"The paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare clonal disease characterized by somatic mutation of gene PIG-A at the level of stem hematopoietic cell. This process results in disorder of synthesis of glycosil phosphatidyl innozitol (GPI) anchor fixing numerous molecules on membrane of blood cells which protect blood cells from impact of complement. The international society of clinical cytometry (2010) proposed the guidelines of detection of clone of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria among erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. The original technique is proposed to evaluate the clone of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in reticulocyte population of blood using method of flow cytofluorometry. The sampling of 160 samples of blood of patients with clinical symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and anemia was analyzed. Two modes of gatedrawing were applied--using monoclonal antibodies to CD71 (receptor to transferrin) and reagent BD ReticCount. The high correlation was established between size of reticulocytic clone of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria evaluated by CD71 and size of granulocytic and monocytic clone of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The developed panel (CD71/CD235a/CD59) can be applied for screening and monitoring of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346985","annotations":[{"name":"Reticulocyte","weight":0.902825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulocyte"},{"name":"Glycophosphatidylinositol","weight":0.88354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycophosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.78456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.736088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.561972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria","weight":0.538707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.285167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.247706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.204958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.157988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"TFRC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TFRC"},{"name":"PIGA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGA"},{"name":"Hemoglobinuria","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobinuria"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"}]}
