{"id":33350,"title":"Persistent neo-aortic growth during adulthood in patients after an arterial switch operation.","abstract":"After the arterial switch operation (ASO), disproportional neo-aortic growth during childhood has been reported. Even though it has been suggested neo-aortic dilation will stabilise in adulthood, data are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the change in neo-aortic dimensions, prevalence of neo-aortic dilation >40?mm and long-term outcome in adults who underwent ASO in childhood.All 116 ASO patients operated in a tertiary referral centre and born before 1995 were included. Of these, 83 (72%) survived to adulthood (>17?years) and six were lost to follow-up. Neo-aortic measurements performed in adulthood were collected from available echocardiographic, cardiovascular magnetic resonance and CT images. The time trend was analysed using a mixed model, adjusted for imaging modality.Clinical data with at least one measurement of the neo-aortic diameter were available in 77 (93%) adult patients and serial measurements in 65 (78%). At baseline (median age 18.1?years), mean neo-aortic diameter was 36Â±5?mm. Mean neo-aortic growth was 0.31?mm/year (p<0.001 compared with normal value 0.08?mm/year) and was linear over time. Freedom from neo-aortic dilation beyond a diameter of 40?mm was 23% at 28?years of age. During a mean clinical follow-up in adulthood of 7.2?years (IQR 4.0 to 10.1), 3 (4%) patients underwent neo-aortic replacement. No other neo-aortic complications occurred.In early adulthood, neo-aortic growth was on average linear and did not stabilise over time.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837983","annotations":[{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.379206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.358033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.330143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.216807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.179143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Time series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mixed model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"40mm grenade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40mm_grenade"},{"name":"Amaury Sport Organisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaury_Sport_Organisation"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Proportionality (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(law)"},{"name":"Jatene procedure","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatene_procedure"}]}
