{"id":46772,"title":"Ex vivo loading of autologous dendritic cells with tumor antigens.","abstract":"Ex vivo-generated antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) have been shown to be immunogenic in patients with cancer. Loading DC with autologous whole tumor antigens is a strategy to arm DC against tumor without human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction. Furthermore, this approach allows the presentation of a full antigen range to the immune system. We describe the methods to obtain whole antigens from autologous tumor tissues in order to load DC generated ex vivo from patients with gastrointestinal cancer.
