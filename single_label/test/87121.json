{"id":87121,"title":"The genetic analysis of new Polish strains of European brown hare syndrome virus.","abstract":"In this paper we describe recently occurring outbreaks of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in a captive hare population. The aim of our study was to evaluate the phylogenetic position of detected Polish strains compared to other European strains of EBHSV. Investigations were undertaken in hares from different provinces of Poland. Liver or spleen samples were tested for viral RNA using the RT-nested PCR method and the products were subsequently sequenced. The genetic analysis was based on the fragment of gene encoding viral capsid protein; it revealed a high homology and close relationship between Polish and European EBHSV strains isolated between 2001 and 2011.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988863","annotations":[{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.800901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Phylogenetic tree","weight":0.665367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.633472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.528131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.473927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Hare","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"European Hare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Hare"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Brown trout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_trout"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"}]}
