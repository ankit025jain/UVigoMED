{"id":52310,"title":"Relationships between TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms and polycystic ovary syndrome risk: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between genetic polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) risk.The PubMed, Centralised Information Service for Complementary Medicine (CISCOM), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and Common Biorepository Model (CBM) databases were searched for relevant articles published before November 1st, 2013, without language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. The relationships were evaluated by calculating the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seven case-control studies with a total 2458 PCOS patients and 5109 healthy subjects' met our inclusion criteria for qualitative data analysis. Two common polymorphisms (rs7903146 C?T and rs12255372 G?T) in the TCF7L2 gene were assessed.The results of our meta-analysis suggested that TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms might be strongly correlated with an increased risk of PCOS (allele model, OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.15-1.54, P<0.001; dominant model, OR=1.40, 95% CI=1.12-1.75, P=0.003), especially for the rs7903146 C?T polymorphism. A subgroup analysis was done to investigate the effect of ethnicity on an individual's risk of PCOS. Our results revealed positive significant correlations between TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms and an increased risk of PCOS among Caucasians (allele model, OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.08-1.47, P=0.004; dominant model, OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.00-1.76, P=0.046) and Asians (allele model, OR=2.02, 95% CI=1.42-2.89, P<0.001; dominant model, OR=2.02, 95% CI=1.40-2.92, P<0.001), but not among Africans (all P<0.05).Our findings provide convincing evidence that TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms may contribute to susceptibility to PCOS, especially for the rs7903146 C?T polymorphism among Caucasians and Asians.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Endocrine System
