{"id":7952,"title":"Correlated inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in peptide-injected animal models of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which emphasize activation of microglia may have particular utility in correlating proinflammatory activity with neurodegeneration. This paper reviews injection of amyloid- ? (A ? ) into rat brain as an alternative AD animal model to the use of transgenic animals. In particular, intrahippocampal injection of A? 1-42 peptide demonstrates prominent microglial mobilization and activation accompanied by a significant loss of granule cell neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory reactivity is demonstrated by a broad spectrum of drugs with a common endpoint in conferring neuroprotection in peptide-injected animals. Peptide-injection models provide a focus on glial cell responses to direct peptide injection in rat brain and offer advantages in the study of the mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation in AD brain.
