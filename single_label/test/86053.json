{"id":86053,"title":"An evaluation of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of employees of a university hospital in an H1N1 influenza pandemic.","abstract":"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors concerning the transmission routes of an H1N1 pandemic and the protective measures of health professionals at a university hospital in Turkey.A stratified systematic sampling method was used to select the sample size of the study group. A total of 22 professors, 29 researchers, and 26 nurses were included in the study.The mean scores of the individuals were 8.4±2.5 (over 20) for knowledge about H1N1 transmission, 27.6±4.0 (over 60) for knowledge about protection against H1N1, 25.8±4.2 (over 45) for correct or appropriate attitudes, and 33.6±8.9 (over 60) for correct behaviors. A negative correlation between total knowledge and behavior was found (p < 0.001, r = -0.543).In epidemics, standard protection measures should be known and applied. Regarding this topic, the web page of the Ministry of Health comes to the forefront as a reliable source of information in addition to scientific explanations.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820459","annotations":[{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.862119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.450483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.421498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.324291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.256577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"University","weight":0.240576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Influenza pandemic","weight":0.121708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.118546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Systematic sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_sampling"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H1N1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1"},{"name":"2009 flu pandemic","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"543","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/543"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Web page","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Department of Health (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Models of scientific inquiry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_scientific_inquiry"}]}
