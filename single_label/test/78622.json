{"id":78622,"title":"[Single stage and staged cochlear implant for chronic suppurative otitis media suffers].","abstract":"To explore and summarize the operation method and operation stage for cochlear implant with chronic suppurative otitis media, to provide the clinical reference for cochlear implant with chronic suppurative otitis media.The clinical data of 6 cases of cochlear implant with chronic suppurative otitis media from Jun 2006 to Mar 2009 in our hospital was analyzed retrospectively. The operation stage. surgical skill, possible risk and prognosis was analyzed and summarized.3 of 6 cases received single stage subtotal petrosectomy and cochlear implant. 3 of 6 cases received subtotal petrosectomy, they received staged cochlear implant 1 to 6 months later. No complications occurred, all of the cochlear implanted had good open set speech perception.Staged operation was the first choice for cochlear implant with chronic suppurative otitis media. Single stage operation took potential risks, it should be done cautiously. The key points for the operation was the clearance of the pathological tissue totally, this required good surgical skill and operation instrument.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616977","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.147588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Open set","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set"},{"name":"Speech perception","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_perception"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Single-stage-to-orbit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
