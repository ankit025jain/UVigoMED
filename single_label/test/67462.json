{"id":67462,"title":"Pre-eclampsia and future cardiovascular risk among women: a review.","abstract":"Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the western world. Due to advancements in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, cardiovascular mortality has fallen in recent years. Previous studies have evaluated the impact of traditional risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia and smoking. However, limited studies have been conducted to evaluate sex discrepancies among patients with cardiovascular disease. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem placentally mediated disease, which usually arises after 32 weeks of gestation and classically presents with hypertension and proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies worldwide and is often complicated by fetal growth restriction. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia are at increased risk of future cardiovascular complications. Therefore, this topic is of significance to the cardiovascular health of over 300 million women worldwide. The goal of this review is to determine the association of pre-eclampsia and future cardiovascular risk and to explore the potential management options for these high-risk women.
