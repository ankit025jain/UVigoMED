{"id":18206,"title":"Endotoxin adsorption using polymyxin B immobilized fiber cartridges in severe sepsis patients following cardiac surgery.","abstract":"Sepsis still represents an obstacle in modern medicine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of selective lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-adsorption therapy using polymyxin B immobilized fiber cartridges in adult patients complicated with severe sepsis after cardiac surgery.65 patients received extracorporeal LPS-adsorption procedures using Toraymyxin columns (PMX; Toray, Tokyo, Japan) in addition to the standard treatment according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. The inclusion criteria were clinical signs of severe sepsis, endotoxin activity assay (EAA)?0.6, and blood plasma procalcitonin (PCT)>2 ng/ml. For the control group, we selected 40 patients who were comparable with the study group but who received only the standard therapy.Each patient received 2 standard LPS-adsorption procedures (lasting for 120 min each). After the LPS-adsorption course, we noted any indices of hemodynamic improvements, including an increase in mean arterial pressure from 73 to 89 mmHg (p<0.001), mean oxygenation index (213-265, p<0.001. We observed a decrease in LPS concentrations by the EAA (0.71-0.55, p<0.001) and by the LAL test (1.44-0.36 EU/ml, p<0.001). In the control group, there were no significant changes in any of the studied parameters. Moreover, the 28-day mortality was 42% in the study group and 65% in the control group (p=0.032). The endotoxin adsorption procedures were not associated with any adverse reactions, and specifically, no extracorporeal circuit thrombosis cases were noted.Selective LPS-adsorption is a safe and possibly effective adjunctive treatment method for severe sepsis patients.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811184","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.747707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.715955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.673047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.490704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.435614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Mean arterial pressure","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_arterial_pressure"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.319422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.298912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tokyo","weight":0.24813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.242677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Los Angeles Lakers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"}]}
