{"id":3594,"title":"[On the possibility of improving the efficiency of cancer recognition and eradication in vivo when concurrently used two different types of nanodevices].","abstract":"When using nanodevices in oncology, it is necessary to provide the efficiency of the performance of these nanodevices simultaneously with their safety for an organism. These are conflicting objectives to some extent. Nevertheless, as shown in this work, an approach that helps to eliminate this contradiction is offered. For recognition and destruction of cancer cells in vivo it is suggested to use instead of one type simultaneously two types of introduced into an organism specialized nanodevices interacting with each other. Some of the nanodevices only recognize cancer cells, while the other ones, that can not recognize them, find cells being marked by nanodevices of the first type, and destroy them. This makes possible to increase the reliability of the cancer cell recognition process on the one side, and have the process of their destruction rather safe for an organism on the other side.","date":"2014-12-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486762","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.408819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.145536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.118728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.0478909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Pest control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Contradiction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
