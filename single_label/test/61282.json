{"id":61282,"title":"The TRAF3 adaptor protein drives proliferation of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells by regulating multiple signaling pathways.","abstract":"T cells devoid of tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-3 (Traf3) exhibit decreased proliferation, sensitivity to apoptosis, and an improper response to antigen challenge. We therefore hypothesized that TRAF3 is critical to the growth of malignant T cells. By suppressing TRAF3 protein in different cancerous T cells, we found that anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cells require TRAF3 for proliferation. Since reducing TRAF3 results in aberrant activation of the noncanonical nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) pathway, we prevented noncanonical NF-?B signaling by suppressing RelB together with TRAF3. This revealed that TRAF3 regulates proliferation independent of the noncanonical NF-?B pathway. However, suppression of NF-?B-inducing kinase (NIK) along with TRAF3 showed that high levels of NIK have a partial role in blocking cell cycle progression. Further investigation into the mechanism by which TRAF3 regulates cell division demonstrated that TRAF3 is essential for continued PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signaling. In addition, we found that while NIK is dispensable for controlling JAK/STAT activity, NIK is critical to regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Analysis of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) showed that NIK modulates PI3K/AKT signaling by altering the localization of PTEN. Together our findings implicate TRAF3 as a positive regulator of the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways and reveal a novel function for NIK in controlling PI3K/AKT activity. These results provide further insight into the role of TRAF3 and NIK in T cell malignancies and indicate that TRAF3 differentially governs the growth of B and T cell cancers.
