{"id":88795,"title":"[Clinical features of carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas in 23 patients].","abstract":"To analyze the clinical features of carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas (CCFs).The medical records of 23 patients with CCFs, which was confirmed by conventional cerebral angiography, in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1990 to October 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Data including patient characteristics, clinical features on ophthalmic examination, neurological assessment, and imaging study were collected.The differences between the direct and the indirect CCFs were compared, and the reasons for misdiagnoses were analyzed.Most patients were presented with ocular symptoms (78.3%). The most common signs were conjunctival injection or chemosis (78.3%), proptosis (69.6%), and ocular motor palsies (56.5%). There were 13 (56.5%) direct CCFs and 1 0(43.5%) indirect CCFs, and a history of encephalic trauma was more frequently reported among the former (61.5%) than the latter (10.0%); also, intracranial vascular murmur was more prevalent in patients with direct CCFs (69.2%vs.20.0%). Nine patients were misdiagnosed as other ocular diseases. Nonspecific clinical symptoms and signs such as chemosis, elevated intraocular pressure, and diplopia were the common causes of the misdiagnoses.Misdiagnosis of CCFs remains common due to its diverse clinical manifestations.CCFs should be suspected in patients with refractory red eyes, intraocular pressure elevation, proptosis and/or ophthalmoplegia, and a detailed history-taking, careful physical examination, and adequate imaging may minimize the misdiagnosis.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and
