{"id":9896,"title":"Cryptotanshinone inhibits lung tumorigenesis and induces apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.","abstract":"Cryptotanshinone is one of the compounds extracted from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. Unlike other tanshinones, only a small number of studies have focused on cryptotanshinone for medical treatment. In the present study, the A549 lung cancer cell line and xenograft models of human lung tumors were used to assess the anti-cancer effect of cryptotanshinone. The effect of cryptotanshinone on human lung cancer, including growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis factors, were identified in vitro, and inhibition of tumor formation, improvement of body condition as well as pathological apoptotic effects were detected in vivo. These results suggested that cryptotanshinone is a potential drug for the treatment and prevention of human lung cancer.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682389","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.537193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.530849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.149098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Salvia miltiorrhiza","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_miltiorrhiza"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Salvia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
