{"id":74656,"title":"[Investments of research and treatment of brain diseases will pay of time].","abstract":"In 2010, a quarter of direct healthcare cost in Europe were spent on brain diseases. The importance of preventing and treating brain diseases and maintaining of functional capacity of the brain will increase in our society with ageing population and with increasing cognitive requirements of modern working life. Public funding of basic and clinical neuroscience has, however, frozen to levels achieved years ago, clinical research of brain diseases being at a particular risk. Research projects directed to prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of brain diseases will pay off, also when assessed by economic measures.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272783","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.843027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.528812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.343286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Investment","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.260833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cryogenics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"}]}
