{"id":87760,"title":"Anterior knee pain in the athlete.","abstract":"Given that the patellofemoral joint is one of the most highly loaded in the human body, the high prevalence of anterior knee pain (AKP) in athletes is unsurprising. Athletes with AKP present a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A clear understanding of the etiology of patellofemoral pain in this population is essential in guiding a focused history and physical examination, and achieving an appropriate diagnosis and treatment approach. This clinical review provides an assessment framework and a guide for neuromuscular function testing, and an overview of the causes and treatments of AKP in this challenging patient population.
