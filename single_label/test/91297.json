{"id":91297,"title":"[Quality of life after multiple trauma].","abstract":"Multiple trauma is an independent injury pattern which, because of its complexity, is responsible for 25?% of the costs for the treatment of all injured patients. Because of the often long-lasting physical impairment and the high incidence of residual permanent handicaps, it is apparent that multiple trauma can lead to a reduction in patient quality of life.The aim of this study was to give an overview of the known data concerning the change in quality of life for multiple trauma patients. Furthermore, predictors for the reduction of quality of life after multiple trauma will be identified.A MedLine search was performed to identify studies dealing with the outcome after multiple trauma.In addition to functional outcome parameters, the term quality of life has become more important in recent years when it comes to evaluating the outcome following injury. While the mortality after multiple trauma could be significantly reduced over the years, there is no comparable effect on the quality of life. Predictors for a worse quality of life after multiple trauma are female gender, high age, low social status, concomitant head injuries and injury to the lower extremities.The fact that mortality after multiple trauma has decreased but not impairment of the quality of life makes it clear that in addition to the acute medical treatment, a follow-up treatment including not only physiotherapy but also psychotherapy is crucial for multiple trauma patients.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519611","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.692821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Social status","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_status"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.491924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.251631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Vowel reduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction"},{"name":"Quality (philosophy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
