{"id":24674,"title":"[Microvessels and mast cells in the dynamics of experimental hypertension].","abstract":"In the dynamics of the experimental renal and hormonal hypertension in rats tracked change parameters such as blood pressure (BP), angiogenesis in microvessels of mesentery in small intestine, the number of mast cells (MC) surrounding microvessels. The same increase in BP there were qualitative and quantitative differences of angiogenesis in microvessels of mesentery in renal and hormonal hypertension. Overall it was the largest new form microvessels in branches with the smallest diameter (12-19 mkm) at hypertension compared with controls. MC response depended on the type of arterial hypertension. Structural changes of microcirculatory bed of mesentery in the small intestine of the rat depend not only on increased BP, but also reflect the characteristics of the pathogenesis of hypertension.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318155","annotations":[{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.861037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.778583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.707499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.381316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"1219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1219"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Continuous track","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_track"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Mast (sailing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_(sailing)"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Military Cross","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Cross"},{"name":"Structural biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
