{"id":8490,"title":"Complex proteinopathy with accumulations of prion protein, hyperphosphorylated tau, ?-synuclein and ubiquitin in experimental bovine spongiform encephalopathy of monkeys.","abstract":"Proteins aggregate in several slowly progressive neurodegenerative diseases called 'proteinopathies'. Studies with cell cultures and transgenic mice overexpressing mutated proteins suggested that aggregates of one protein induced misfolding and aggregation of other proteins as well - a possible common mechanism for some neurodegenerative diseases. However, most proteinopathies are 'sporadic', without gene mutation or overexpression. Thus, proteinopathies in WT animals genetically close to humans might be informative. Squirrel monkeys infected with the classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent developed an encephalopathy resembling variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with accumulations not only of abnormal prion protein (PrP(TSE)), but also three other proteins: hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), ?-synuclein and ubiquitin; ?-amyloid protein (A?) did not accumulate. Severity of brain lesions correlated with spongiform degeneration. No amyloid was detected. These results suggested that PrP(TSE) enhanced formation of p-tau and aggregation of ?-synuclein and ubiquitin, but not A?, providing a new experimental model for neurodegenerative diseases associated with complex proteinopathies.
