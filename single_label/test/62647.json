{"id":62647,"title":"[Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma: clinical analysis of 42 cases].","abstract":"To explore the clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL).The clinical features and prognostic factors of 42 cases newly diagnosed as AITL at Peking University Cancer Hospital from January 2007 to August 2012 were retrospectively analyzed.Their median age was 59(34-76) years. Among them, 97.6% cases (41/42) belonged to Ann Arbor stage III/IV, 73.8% (31/42) cases presented with B symptoms, 85.7% (36/42)cases had painless lymphadenopathy, 52.4% (22/42)cases extranodal involvement, 64.3% (27/42) cases elevated lactate dehydrogenase and 45.2% (19/42) cases elevated ?2-microglobulin at diagnosis. And 40.5% (17/42) cases had 3 points of international prognostic index (IPI) score with the highest proportion.First-line chemotherapy was predominantly CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisolone) or CHOP-like-based and complete response was achieved in 44.7% (17/38) of them. The median follow-up time was 40 (2-106) months The 1, 2, 5-year survival rates were 78%, 57% and 39% respectively.Statistical analysis showed that IPI was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.009).Other factors included gender (P = 0.311), age (P = 0.263), with or without B symptoms (P = 0.102), Ki-67 index (P = 0.146) as well as the choice of first-line chemotherapy (P = 0.292) each had a tendency of affecting; the survival rate, but failed to reach statistical significance.Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a major type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Most AITL patients are elders with a late stage. The disease generally displays an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534347","annotations":[{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.837421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma","weight":0.772134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioimmunoblastic_T-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"T-cell lymphoma","weight":0.546945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"B symptoms","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_symptoms"},{"name":"Ann Arbor staging","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor_staging"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.222903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.213635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"}]}
