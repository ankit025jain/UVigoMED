{"id":82853,"title":"Image-guided robotic stereotactic radiotherapy for synchronous cancer of maxillary gingiva and lung.","abstract":"The use of stereotactic body radiation therapy is rapidly increasing among patients with lung cancer not amenable to surgery. The authors report their experience using the CyberKnife system (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) as a treatment option for synchronous cancer of oral squamous cell carcinoma and a malignant lung tumour. An 88-year-old woman with two cancers (oral and lung masses) underwent CyberKnife treatment, with fiducial gold pins implanted using bronchoscopy. Toxicity was limited, and at the 2-year follow-up the lesions had not recurred.
