{"id":81778,"title":"Management of the single discoloured tooth. Part 2: Restorative options.","abstract":"This is the second article of a two part series covering the aetiology, prevention and broad range of management options for the single discoloured tooth. The article covers situations where masking and simulation techniques with direct composite are required. Direct composite, indirect composite and ceramic veneers are then considered, as well as full coverage crowns. The option of extraction of the affected tooth and its prosthodontic replacement will also be considered. Clinical cases are used to illustrate various scenarios.The single discoloured tooth is a commonly encountered clinical problem in general dental practice. A wide variety of management options exist and it is recommended that general dental practitioners consider adopting minimally invasive techniques in the first instance before moving on to more invasive therapies.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839707","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.900917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.539644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.440443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.392249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.36631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ceramic","weight":0.322396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.217545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Prosthodontics","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthodontics"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Veneer (dentistry)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneer_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Livor mortis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livor_mortis"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"}]}
