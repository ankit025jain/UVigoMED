{"id":18912,"title":"Replacement of HA-MRSA by CA-MRSA infections at an academic medical center in the midwestern United States, 2004-5 to 2008.","abstract":"We noted anecdotally that infections designated as health care-associated (HA-) MRSA by epidemiologic criteria seemed to be decreasing in incidence at the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) after 2004. We compared MRSA patients seen at any site of clinical care at UCMC and the isolates that caused their infections in 2004-5 (n?=?545) with those in 2008 (n?=?135). The percent of patients with MRSA infections cultured > 2 days after hospital admission decreased from 19.5% in 2004-5 to 7.4% in 2008 (p?=?0.001). The percent in 2004-5 compared with 2008 who had a hospitalization (49.1% to 26.7%, p?=?0.001) or surgery (43.0% to 14.1%, p<0.001) in the previous year decreased. In 2008 a greater percent of patients was seen in the emergency department (23.1% vs. 39.3%) and a smaller percent both in intensive care units (15.6% vs. 6.7%) and in other inpatient units (40.7% vs. 32.6%) (p<0.001). The percent of patients with CA-MRSA infections by the CDC epidemiologic criteria increased from 36.5% in 2004-5 to 62.2% in 2008 (p<0.001). The percent of MRSA isolates sharing genetic characteristics of USA100 decreased from 27.9% (152/545) to 12.6% (17/135), while the percent with CA-MRSA (USA300) characteristics increased from 53.2% (290/545) to 66.7% (90/135). The percent of infections that were invasive did not change significantly. Our data suggest that HA-MRSA infections, both by epidemiologic and microbiologic criteria, relative to CA-MRSA, decreased between 2004-5 and 2008 at UCMC.
