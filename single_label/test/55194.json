{"id":55194,"title":"Diagnostic evaluation and surgical outcome of idiopathic isolated, acquired inferior oblique palsy: a rare presentation.","abstract":"Isolated inferior oblique muscle palsy is the least common of all extra-ocular muscle palsies and very few reports are available in the literature. It can present a formidable therapeutic challenge to the ophthalmologist, as treatment options need to be titrated on an individual basis. A patient of 60 years old of idiopathic right inferior oblique palsy who underwent an adjustable superior rectus recession in his left eye, with a satisfactory surgical outcome and symptomatic resolution of diplopia is reported.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968488","annotations":[{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Extraocular muscles","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.562603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.523816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.425669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inferior oblique muscle","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abdominal external oblique muscle","weight":0.10245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_external_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Superior rectus muscle","weight":0.091096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"}]}
