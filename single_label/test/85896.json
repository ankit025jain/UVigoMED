{"id":85896,"title":"Endovascular treatment of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism.","abstract":"Massive and submassive pulmonary embolism constitutes the high- and intermediate-risk categories of pulmonary embolism. Both are associated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity and may benefit from more aggressive management than from standard anticoagulation alone. Endovascular treatment is a promising treatment modality that may offer added benefit at low additional risk.
