{"id":73377,"title":"E2F1-regulated DROSHA promotes miR-630 biosynthesis in cisplatin-exposed cancer cells.","abstract":"DNA damage may regulate microRNA (miRNA) biosynthesis at the levels of miRNA transcription, processing and maturation. Although involvement of E2F1 in the regulation of miRNA gene activation in response to DNA damage has been documented, little is known about the role of E2F1 in miRNA processing. In this study we demonstrate that E2F1 enhances miR-630 biosynthesis under cisplatin (CIS) exposure through promoting DROSHA-mediated pri-miR-630 processing. Northern blot and RT-qPCR revealed that CIS exposure caused not only an increase in pri-miR-630 but also much more increase in pre-miR-630 and mature miR-630. The increases in pri-miR-630 and pre-miR-630 expression in unmatched proportion indicated that primary transcript processing was involved in CIS-stimulated miR-630 biosynthesis. Furthermore, combination of reporter enzyme assay with mutation and over-expression of E2F1 showed that induction of DROSHA promoted miR-630 expression, in which CIS-induced E2F1 activated DROSHA gene expression by recognizing and binding two E2F1 sites at the positions -214/-207 and -167/-160 of the DROSHA promoter. The increased binding of E2F1 to the DROSHA promoter in CIS-exposed cells was further evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Together, E2F1-regulated DROSHA promotes pri-miR-630 processing, thereby, contributes to CIS-stimulated miR-630 expression. The involvement of E2F1-dependent DROSHA activation in pri-miRNA processing under DNA damage stress will provide further insight into the regulation of miRNA biosynthesis. These data also give us a deeper understanding of E2F1 role in response to DNA damage.
