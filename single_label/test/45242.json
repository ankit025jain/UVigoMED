{"id":45242,"title":"Surgical treatment and adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with biliary tract cancer: single institution experience of 100 patients.","abstract":"Surgery remains the treatment of choice for patients with resectable biliary tract cancer, enhancing the chance of cure and increasing long-term survival. Early recurrence, however, is frequent in patients who have undergone curative resection. To date, no randomized controlled trials have assessed adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with biliary tract cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of surgical management followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with biliary tract cancer.This study enrolled 100 patients with Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages I-IV biliary tract cancer who underwent surgical resection, including 16 who received sequential adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine or S-1. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and prognostic factors were analyzed.The median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months. Forty-one patients had lymph node metastasis and 81 underwent RO resection. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 80.9%, 48.6%, and 38.3%, respectively, and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 59.8%, 39.9%, and 24.9%, respectively. Five-year OS rates were similar in patients who did (40.4%) and did not (32.4%) receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The morbidity and mortality rates were 59% and 3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that only lymph node metastasis (p = 0.042) was independently associated with long-term survival.The presence of lymph node metastasis significantly affected long-term survival, whereas adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect outcomes in our patients with resectable biliary tract cancer.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693682","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Biliary tract","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_tract"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.759961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"UICC","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UICC"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.615743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.590836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.503324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.428706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
