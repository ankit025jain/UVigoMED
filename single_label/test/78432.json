{"id":78432,"title":"[Expression and methylation status of IGFBP-rP1 gene in laryngocarcinoma].","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between the promoter methylation and protein expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1(IGFBP-rP1) in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).Methylation specific PCR (MSP) approach and immunohistochemistry methods were used to examine the methylation status and protein expression of IGFBP-rP1 in 45 samples of laryngeal carcinoma and 18 samples of tissues beside cancer.For the promoter site, methylation frequency of IGFBP-rP1 in tumor specimens (33.3%, 15/45) was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (5.6%, 1/18) (P < 0.05). The protein expression of IGFBP-rP1 in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (P < 0.05) and was inversely correlated with its methylation status of promoter.Epigenetic silencing of IGFBP-rP1 gene expression by promoter hypermethylation may play an important role in LSCC.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669683","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.683877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.285295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.151096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"1545","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1545"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Member of the Scottish Parliament","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament"}]}
