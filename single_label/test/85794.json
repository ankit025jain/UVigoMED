{"id":85794,"title":"Afatinib with concurrent radiotherapy in a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.","abstract":"The combination of radiotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib and gefitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been widely investigated. For afatinib, a new second generation irreversible pan-EGFR TKI, no clinical trials in this setting have as yet been performed.We report a patient with a pretreated metastatic NSCLC receiving afatinib in combination with concomitant palliative radiotherapy to the mediastinum and primary lung tumor. The treatment was feasible and well tolerated. The patient achieved a partial response in the irradiated tumor region and the metastatic sites.The combination of afatinib and radiotherapy is promising and should be investigated further. However, because of the limited experience and potential side effects known for other EGFR TKIs, a decision for treatment outside a clinical trial has to be made very carefully, balancing the risk and benefit on an individual patient basis.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853786","annotations":[{"name":"Gefitinib","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefitinib"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.875947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Erlotinib","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlotinib"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.782888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.719848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.26678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0348718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Afatinib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
