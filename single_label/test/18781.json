{"id":18781,"title":"Implementing AORN recommended practices for environmental cleaning.","abstract":"In recent years, researchers have developed an increasing awareness of the role of the environment in the development of health care-associated infections. AORN's \"Recommended practices for environmental cleaning\" is an evidence-based document that provides specific guidance for cleaning processes, for the selection of appropriate cleaning equipment and supplies, and for ongoing education and quality improvement. This updated recommended practices document has an expanded focus on the need for health care personnel to work collaboratively to accomplish adequately thorough cleanliness in a culture of safety and mutual support. Perioperative nurses, as the primary advocates for patients while they are being cared for in the perioperative setting, should help ensure that a safe, clean environment is reestablished after each surgical procedure.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766919","annotations":[{"name":"Culture","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.328393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Advocacy","weight":0.3225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Health Human Resources","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Human_Resources"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"Continuing professional development","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_professional_development"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"}]}
