{"id":91622,"title":"Radiographic prevalence of CAM-type femoroacetabular impingement after open reduction and internal fixation of femoral neck fractures.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to estimate the radiographic prevalence of CAM-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in elderly patients (? 50 years) who have undergone internal fixation for femoral neck fracture.A total of 187 frog-leg lateral radiographs of elderly patients who underwent internal fixation for a femoral neck fracture were reviewed by two independent reviewers. The alpha angle, beta angle, and femoral head-neck offset ratio were calculated. The presence of two abnormal radiographic parameters was deemed to be diagnostic of radiographic CAM-type impingement.Radiographic CAM-type FAI was identified in 157 out of 187 (84 %) patients who underwent internal fixation for fractures of the femoral neck. Moderate-to-good inter-observer reliability was achieved in the measurement of radiographic parameters. With reference to fracture subtypes and prevalence of radiographic features of CAM-type morphology, 97 (72 %) out of 134 patients were positive for CAM in Garden subtypes I and II, whereas 49 (85.9 %) out of 57 patients had radiographic CAM in Garden III and IV subtypes.There was a high prevalence of CAM-type FAI in patients that underwent surgical fixation of femoral neck fractures. This is significantly higher than the reported prevalence in non-fracture patient populations. The high prevalence of CAM morphology could be related to several factors, including age, fracture morphology, quality of reduction, type of fixation, and fracture healing.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488220","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.547415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.536565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.531615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.464248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.425259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.385076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.361341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.329587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.200698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.098014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"},{"name":"Inter-rater reliability","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability"},{"name":"Femoral acetabular impingement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_acetabular_impingement"},{"name":"Beta angle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_angle"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Football Association of Ireland","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Ireland"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
