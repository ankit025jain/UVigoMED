{"id":82630,"title":"Quantitative determination of c-myc facilitates the assessment of prognosis of OSCC patients.","abstract":"Myc genes are a family of proto-oncogenes whose proteins are implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and in regulating the activity of genes involved in cell division. The aim of the present study was to establish a quantitative description of the expression of c-myc and evaluate its relationship with other clinical and prognostic factors, as well as to establish a multivariate survival prediction model. This is a retrospective study of 68 patients diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We constructed a tissue microarray for investigating the expression of c-myc by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses were carried out, and a multivariate model that predicts survival was established. The average expression of c-myc was 50.32 (SD, 26.05) with a range from 6.60 to 99.48; similar for initial and advanced tumor stages. Non-smoking patients had higher levels of c-myc, showing statistically significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis ?2=5.975; p=0.05). We found no statistically significant relationship between the quantitative expression of c-myc and any other clinical or pathological parameters. For each unit of increase of c-myc, the risk increased by 1.15 (p<0.001; HR, 1.150; 95% CI, 1062-1245). Further study of this protein, which may have a significant diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value is warranted. Its determination can be valuable when used together with other markers to assess the prognosis of OSCC patients.
