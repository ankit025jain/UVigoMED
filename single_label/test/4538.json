{"id":4538,"title":"Airway inflammation and tiotropium treatment in stable COPD patients.","abstract":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease of the lung associated with progressive airflow limitation. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of tiotropium treatment on airway inflammation and symptoms in stable COPD patients.Inflammatory markers were measured in the expired breath condensate fluid (EBC) before starting tiotropium treatment and at the end of the first month.Twenty-two patients (81% men) with a mean age of 65.4 ± 10.1 years completed the study. The mean nitrotyrosine and 8-isoprostane levels for oxidative stress markers in EBC before and after treatment were 4.5 ± 2.3, 3.5 ± 1.9 pg/mL (P = 0.06) and 7.3 ± 10.8, 8.1 ± 11.7 pg/mL (P = 0.28), respectively. The mean interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels for inflammation markers in EBC before and after treatment were 1.03 ± 1.1, 0.77 ± 0.8 pg/mL (P = 0.41) and 27.8 ± 2.6, 29.2 ± 5.7 pg/mL (P = 0.36) respectively. The mean symptom scores decreased significantly with tiotropium and a mean increase of 124.6 ± 0.86 mL was observed in a lung function test (FEV1).Although a 4-week treatment with tiotropium did not modify any of the inflammatory or oxidative stress markers in EBC fluid, tiotropium treatment helps to control symptoms in COPD.","date":"2014-12-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25539549","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Lung function test","weight":0.688855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_function_test"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.507266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.170048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Tiotropium bromide","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiotropium_bromide"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Recurrent airway obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
