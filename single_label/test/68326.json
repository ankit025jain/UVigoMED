{"id":68326,"title":"Home blood pressure monitoring in CKD.","abstract":"Hypertension is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the prevalence increases with declining kidney function. Hypertension management is particularly important due to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the CKD population. Most clinical decisions for blood pressure (BP) management are based on BP readings in the office or dialysis unit. These BP readings often are inaccurate. Home BP monitoring provides more data than conventional clinic or dialysis-unit BP measurements and is relatively easy to accomplish, is cost-effective, and has been shown to have an increasing role in the management of BP in the CKD population. This In Practice article focuses on the use of home BP monitoring in patients with CKD. We also provide guidance for choosing a BP monitoring device and review recent literature regarding the use of home BP monitoring and the effect on CKD outcomes. In addition, we address the future use of electronic medical records and how they may interface with home BP monitoring.
