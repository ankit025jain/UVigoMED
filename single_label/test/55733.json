{"id":55733,"title":"Heavy silicone oil as a long-term endotamponade agent for complicated retinal detachments.","abstract":"We retrospectively evaluated a heavy silicone oil (HSO) as a long-term intraocular endotamponade agent to treat complicated RD by inferior PVR in 25 eyes of 25 patients. Patients underwent PPV and injection of Oxane HD as an internal tamponade agent. A comparison of preoperative and postoperative BCVA at month 1, month 6, and last visit was made in the group in which HSO was removed and in the group in which HSO was not removed. Statistical calculations were performed using the Wilcoxon test. The HSO was removed from 11 patients after a mean of 26.55 ± 21.38 months. The HSO remained inside the vitreous cavity in 14 eyes due to a high chance of PVR recurrence (mean follow-up period, 11.07 ± 7.44 months). Anatomic success was achieved in 92%. The BCVA in the group, in which HSO was not removed, improved significantly during the first 6 months. Among the patients who had the oil removed, there was improvement in BCVA after 1 month. Oil emulsification was the most common adverse effect in 52% of eyes. HSO is an effective tamponade in complex rhegmatogenous and tractional RD complicated by PVR. HSO can remain in the eye for long periods with relative tolerability and safety.
