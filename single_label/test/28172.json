{"id":28172,"title":"Polymorphisms in genes encoding dopamine signalling pathway and risk of alcohol dependence: a systematic review.","abstract":"Alcohol dependence (AD) is one of the major elements that significantly influence drinking pattern that provoke the alcohol-induced organ damage. The structural and neurophysiologic abnormalities in the frontal lobes of chronic alcoholics were revealed by magnetic resonance imaging scans. It is well known that candidate genes involved in dopaminergic pathway are of immense interest to the researchers engaged in a wide range of addictive disorders. Dopaminergic pathway gene polymorphisms are being extensively studied with respect to addictive and behavioral disorders.From the broad literature available, the current review summarizes the specific polymorphisms of dopaminergic genes that play a role in alcohol dependence.No evidence indicating any strong association between AD and polymorphisms of dopamine pathway genes has emerged from the literature.Further studies are warranted, considering a range of alcohol-related traits to determine the genes that influence alcohol dependence.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983092","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.852729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.745082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.736221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.678288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.636073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.63455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.392553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Dopaminergic pathways","weight":0.266257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic_pathways"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0614898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"}]}
