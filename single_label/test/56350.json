{"id":56350,"title":"Assessment of endothelial cell density and corneal thickness in corneal grafts an average of 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty.","abstract":"Corneal transparency is a useful indicator for corneal function. Our aim was to investigate central corneal endothelial cells and corneal thickness in transplanted corneas at an average of 5.4 years after penetrating keratoplastyThe study involved 68 perforated keratoplasty patients with at least a 1 year follow-up. Post-operatively, the central corneal endothelial layer was observed using a contact specular microscope. Central endothelial cell density, corneal thickness and the coefficient of variation of endothelial size were statistically analysed.The post-operative follow-up time was ranging from 12 months to 23 years. Endothelial cell density (ECD) was 1,501?±?249 cell/mm(2). The average cell size was 673.6?±?98.3 ?m(2), and the coefficient of variation of cell size was 0.61?±?0.11. No difference in ECD was detected between diagnostic groups. Corneal thickness was 0.56?±?0.06 mm. Correlation between ECD and post-operative time was not significant (r?=?0.02; p?=?0.85).Our study concluded that ECD showed a higher rate of decrease after penetrating keratoplasty with no relation to pre-operative diagnosis.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24700243","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.712168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.324989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.302877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Coefficient of variation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/560"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"698","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/698"},{"name":"673","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/673"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Corneal endothelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_endothelium"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Cell size","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_size"},{"name":"Specular reflection","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Dummy variable (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)"}]}
