{"id":89490,"title":"[Clinico-epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of patients with hip fracture].","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to characterize the clinico-epidemiologic variables of patients with hip fracture and assess the presence of complications, whether dependent or independent of performing surgery within 48 hours of the fracture.A descriptive applied cross-sectional study of patients who underwent hip surgery was performed. Five hundred patients were included; females were predominant as they accounted for 68% (339); mean age was 75.5 years. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent conditions. Pertrochanteric fractures represented 56% (257) and were predominant.Mean operative time was 1.2 hours; and partial hip prosthesis accounted for 25.6% (128) and was the most common surgery performed, followed by plate osteosynthesis, which accounted for 25.4% (127) of the 457 procedures performed. The complication rate was 17%, with bronchopneumonia (2%) as the most frequent one; reoperation was the most frequent surgical complication (7.4%). Mean waiting time before surgery ranged from 72 hours to 14 days (73.2%) and mean hospital stay ranged between 7 and 15 days (37%).The highest incidence of fractures occurs in females over age 75. The most frequent fracture is the pertrochanteric one, with a high incidence of chronic-degenerative conditions that results in increased postoperative complications when surgical treatment is provided after 48 hours.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716368","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.708981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.650484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.574758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.154944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Bronchopneumonia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopneumonia"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Independent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"}]}
