{"id":28564,"title":"Binge drinking, stimulant use and HIV risk in a sample of illicit drug using heterosexual Black men.","abstract":"Relatively little research has examined the effects of binge drinking and HIV risk in heterosexual Black men. Even less research has explored this relationship in illicit drug using heterosexual Black men who are at an elevated risk of contracting and transmitting HIV through various vectors, including risky sexual behavior, in the Black community.The purpose of the current study is to examine the associations between binge drinking, drug use and HIV status in a community-based sample of 127 self-identified heterosexual Black men.Overall, 17% reported binge drinking in the past month. Both stimulant use (AOR 7.29; 95%; CIs, 2.07, 25.70), and binge drinking (AOR=5.28; 95% CIs, 1.34, 20.91) were associated with HIV status.These findings will inform prevention interventions to reduce the HIV risk among Black heterosexual men.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837758","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.778993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.568304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Binge drinking","weight":0.548063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_drinking"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.522407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Album-oriented rock","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Transmitter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter"},{"name":"African American culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_culture"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}]}
