{"id":63445,"title":"High-dose vitamin C management in dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia.","abstract":"Methylene blue is the first-choice treatment of methemoglobinemia, but it is not readily available in most Korean emergency departments because of an import suspension. An 84-year-old woman with dapsone-induced massive methemoglobinemia visited our emergency department for unclear mentality and cyanosis. Because methylene blue was not available, we intravenously administrated vitamin C (VC) for symptomatic methemoglobinemia, although VC is not a universally accepted treatment. Vitamin C (10 g intravenously) administered 6 hourly successfully treated the dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia and did not adversely affect renal functions. Thus,we recommend that if methylene blue is unavailable, 6 hourly intravenous administrations of 10 g of VC should be considered for dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439259","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.813295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.603978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.363787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.318004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Methemoglobinemia","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia"},{"name":"Import","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Methylenes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenes"},{"name":"Victoria Cross","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Mindset","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Methylene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
