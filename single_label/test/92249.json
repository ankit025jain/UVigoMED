{"id":92249,"title":"Global childhood unintentional injury study: multisite surveillance data.","abstract":"We aimed to analyze the epidemiology of childhood unintentional injuries presenting to hospitals in 5 select sites in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, and Pakistan).We collected standardized data from children ages 0 to 12 years at participating emergency departments (EDs) in 2007. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the characteristics of these injuries and to explore the determinants of injury outcomes.Among 2686 injured children, falls (50.4%) and road traffic injuries (16.4%) were the most common, affecting boys more often (64.7%). Home injuries were more common among younger children (average 5.41 vs 7.06 years) and girls (38.2% vs 31.7%). Following an ED visit, 24% of injured children were admitted to the hospital, and 6 died. Injury outcomes were associated with risk factors, such as age and sex, to varying extents.Standardized ED surveillance revealed unintentional injuries are a threat to child health. The majority of events took place inside the home, challenging traditional concepts of children's safety and underscoring the need for intensified context-appropriate injury prevention.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432924","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.813286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.722947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Bangladesh","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.622133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.580751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.533638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.488317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.421615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.348425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.261966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.246245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.224639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.185378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.160377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Pediatric nursing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_nursing"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"}]}
