{"id":51545,"title":"Can treatment of nocturia increase testosterone level in men with late onset hypogonadism?","abstract":"To assess the effect of desmopressin on serum testosterone level in men with nocturia and late onset hypogonadism.We prospectively enrolled men with nocturia and symptoms of late onset hypogonadism. Desmopressin (0.1 mg) was administered once daily to patients for 12 weeks, and we then compared serum testosterone levels, electrolytes, frequency volume chart indices, and changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function, and Aging Male's Symptom scales before and after treatment. Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or hyponatremia, those using hypnotics, and those who had primary hypogonadism or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism were excluded from the study.Sixty-two men (mean age, 68.4 years) completed pre- and post-treatment questionnaires and underwent laboratory testing. At the end of the study, the testosterone levels in men with low testosterone levels (<3.5 ng/mL) increased after the 12-week desmopressin treatment (2.85 ± 0.58 to 3.97 ± 1.44 ng/mL; P = .001). Mean scores had decreased from 17.7 to 13.9 (IPSS), 3.8 to 3.2 (IPSS-Quality of Life), and 33.7 to 31.1 (Aging Male's Symptom). On the frequency volume chart, nocturnal urine volume, nocturnal polyuria index, actual number of nocturia events, nocturia index, and nocturnal bladder capacity index were significantly decreased.Desmopressin improved nocturia and other urinary symptoms. Moreover, serum testosterone levels increased significantly in men with low testosterone levels after 12-week desmopressin treatment.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680454","annotations":[{"name":"Polyuria","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyuria"},{"name":"Desmopressin","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmopressin"},{"name":"Nocturia","weight":0.889968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturia"},{"name":"Hyponatremia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.765787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Hypnotic","weight":0.364764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
