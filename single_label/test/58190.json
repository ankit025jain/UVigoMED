{"id":58190,"title":"Accuracy of hysteroscopy made by young residents in detecting endometrial pathologies in postmenopausal women.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to analyze the diagnostic value of hysteroscopy made by young residents in evaluating uterine cavity compared to experienced hysteroscopists with histological diagnosis as reference in postmenopausal women, with particular attention to endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.A total of 600 postmenopausal women that underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy (DH) between January 2011 and December 2013 were evaluated. The authors compared the first 200 hysteroscopic findings of each young resident with those of seniors that supervised all the procedures, regarding the same patients. Subsequent histological evaluation was obtained by operative hysteroscopy or endometrial biopsy. Residents' and seniors' data were compared with the final histological diagnosis established by anatomopathologist.No adverse effects such as vaso-vagal reactions or uterine perforations in DH neither in operative hysteroscopic procedures were reported. Hysteroscopy made by residents had 60%, 9.09%, and 70.4% sensitivity (SE) and 97.1%, 98.8%, and 99.1% specificity (SP) in detecting hyperplasia without atypia, hyperplasia with atypia, and endometrial cancer, respectively. On the other hand, DH made by seniors resulted in 85%, 72.7%, and 96.3% SE and 99.8%, 99.8%, and 100% SP, in detecting the same three histological findings.Outpatient hysteroscopy made by residents at their endoscopic experience beginning has good accuracy in detecting clear endometrial malignant lesions, unlike in detecting premalignant lesion as hyperplasia with atypia. This could signify that more than 200 hysteroscopies are necessary for a resident to well recognize premalignant and malignant lesions.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984531","annotations":[{"name":"Hysteroscopy","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteroscopy"},{"name":"Endometrial hyperplasia","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Endometrial biopsy","weight":0.515767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_biopsy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Postmenopausal","weight":0.403392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmenopausal"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
