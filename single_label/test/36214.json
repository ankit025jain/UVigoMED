{"id":36214,"title":"Immobilized chicks as a model system for early-onset developmental dysplasia of the hip.","abstract":"We have almost no understanding of how our joints take on their range of distinctive shapes, despite the clinical relevance of joint morphogenesis to postnatal skeletal malformations such as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). In this study, we investigate the role of spontaneous prenatal movements in joint morphogenesis using pharmacological immobilization of developing chicks, and assess the system as a suitable model for early-onset hip dysplasia. We show that, prior to joint cavitation, the lack of dynamic muscle contractions has little impact on the shape of the hip joint. However, after the timepoint at which cavitation occurs, a dramatic effect on hip joint morphogenesis was observed. Effects in the immobilized chicks included flattening of the proximal femur, abnormal orientation of the pelvis relative to the femur and abnormal placement and coverage of the acetabulum. Although many clinical case studies have identified reduced or restricted movement as a risk factor for DDH, this study provides the first experimental evidence of the role of prenatal movements in early hip joint development. We propose that the immobilized chick embryo serves as a suitable model system for the type of early-onset DDH which arises due to neuromuscular conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590854","annotations":[{"name":"Hip dysplasia (canine)","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(canine)"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.794664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.716153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.665902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.635961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.551409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.478883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Hip joint","weight":0.418511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Muscle atrophy","weight":0.279241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_atrophy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Spinal muscular atrophy","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_muscular_atrophy"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cavitation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Lying (position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_(position)"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
