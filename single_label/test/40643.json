{"id":40643,"title":"Grading scale of visceral adipose tissue thickness and their relation to the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","abstract":"The mesenteric fat is drained by the portal system, being related to the metabolic syndrome which is an impor-tant risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Graduate of visceral fat thickness and correlate with the NAFLD degree through ultrasonography method.We studied 352 subjects for age, gender, measures of subcutaneous fat thickness and visceral fat thickness as well as the presence and degree of liver fatty. Was analyzed the independent relationship between visceral fat thickness and NAFLD, and linear regression analysis was used in order to predict the visceral fat thickness from subcutaneous fat thickness.The mean age of 225 women (63.9%) and 127 men (36.1%) was 47.5 ± 14.0 (18-77) years, 255 subjects had normal examinations, 97 had NAFLD thus distributed, 37 grade 1, 32 grade 2, and 28 grade 3. The subcutaneous fat thickness ranged from 0.26 to 3.50 cm with a mean of 1.3 ± 0.6 cm and visceral fat thickness ranged from 0.83 to 8.86 cm with a mean of 3.6 ± 1.7 cm. Linear regression showed that for every increase of 1 cm in subcutaneous fat thickness the visceral fat thickness will increase 0.9 cm.The visceral fat thickness measured by ultrasonography is a useful and seems to be able to help estimate the risk of NAFLD.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003263","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.47113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.451168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.433367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.426857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.321863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Graduate school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_school"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Portal venous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_venous_system"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
