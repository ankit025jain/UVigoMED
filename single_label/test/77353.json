{"id":77353,"title":"[Musculoskeletal pain in Venezuelan oil tanker crews].","abstract":"The objective of this investigation was to analyze the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain (MSP) in oil tanker crew members in Venezuela. A descriptive cross-sectional study was implemented, using a modified version of the Standardized Nordic Questionnaires. The prevalence of MSP in 127 men was 82%. The mean age was statistically different (p < 0.05) between the MSP group (39.29 +/- 10.16 years, range 24-60) and the no-MSP group (34.9 +/- 9.76 years, range 24-58 years). There was no significant difference between the body mass indexes (BMI) of the MSP group (29.94 +/- 4.31 kg/m2) and the no-MSP group (30.02 +/- 4.96 km/m2). The majority of the crew members with MSP (83%) had < or = 10 years seniority, mean value of 4.31 +/- 2.44 years. MSP occurrence was the same (50%) for crew members located in engine rooms and decks. The MSP frequency for anatomical region was 57% in lower back, 32% knees, 24% in neck and upper back and 19% shoulders. There was a significant association between lower back pain and seniority (p < 0.05), also between age and BMI (p < 0.01); and an inverse significant correlation (p < 0.01) between lower back pain and knee pain, age and neck pain and seniority in the job. The crew members in the deck area showed a higher occurrence of neck pain (33%) than the engine crew (16%) (p< 0.01). Our findings suggest the need to implement health programs to reduce the occurrence of MSP in the workplace.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Occupational
