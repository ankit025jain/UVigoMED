{"id":86738,"title":"Novel thrombolytic protease from edible and medicinal plant Aster yomena (Kitam.) Honda with anticoagulant activity: purification and partial characterization.","abstract":"A thrombolytic protease named kitamase possessing anticoagulant property was purified from edible and medicinal plant Aster yomena (Kitam.) Honda. Kitamase showed a molecular weight of 50 kDa by SDS-PAGE and displayed a strong fibrin zymogram lysis band corresponding to the similar molecular mass. The enzyme was active at high temperatures (50°C). The fibrinolytic activity of kitamase was strongly inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, TPCK and PMSF, inhibited by Zn(2+). The Km and Vmax values for substrate S-2251 were determined as 4.31 mM and 23.81 mM/mg respectively. It dissolved fibrin clot directly and specifically cleaved the ?, A? and ?-? chains of fibrin and fibrinogen. In addition, kitamase delayed the coagulation time and increased activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. Kitamase exerted a significant protective effect against collagen and epinephrine induced pulmonary thromboembolism in mice. These results suggest that kitamase may have the property of metallo-protease like enzyme, novel fibrino(geno)lytic enzyme and a potential to be a therapeutic agent for thrombosis.
