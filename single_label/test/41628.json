{"id":41628,"title":"Infants with FPIES to solid food proteins--chicken, rice and oats.","abstract":"We present two cases of Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), a non-IgE mediated food hypersensitivity. FPIES induces severe vomiting 1.5-to-3 hours post ingestion of the offending food, and may be associated with diarrhoea, hypovolemic shock and acidosis. Avoidance of that food will lead to resolution of symptoms and prevents further episodes.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908862","annotations":[{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.546041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Acidosis","weight":0.461316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis"},{"name":"Oat","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat"},{"name":"Hypovolemia","weight":0.286645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovolemia"},{"name":"Enterocolitis","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"}]}
