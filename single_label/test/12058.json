{"id":12058,"title":"The long noncoding RNA CHRF regulates cardiac hypertrophy by targeting miR-489.","abstract":"Sustained cardiac hypertrophy is often accompanied by maladaptive cardiac remodeling leading to decreased compliance and increased risk for heart failure. Maladaptive hypertrophy is considered to be a therapeutic target for heart failure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have various biological functions and have been extensively investigated in past years.We identified miR-489 and lncRNAs (cardiac hypertrophy related factor, CHRF) from hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that miR-489 and CHRF can participate in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro.A microarray was performed to analyze miRNAs in response to angiotensin II treatment, and we found miR-489 was substantially reduced. Enforced expression of miR-489 in cardiomyocytes and transgenic overexpression of miR-489 both exhibited reduced hypertrophic response on angiotensin II treatment. We identified myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) as a miR-489 target to mediate the function of miR-489 in cardiac hypertrophy. Knockdown of Myd88 in cardiomyocytes and Myd88-knockout mice both showed attenuated hypertrophic responses. Furthermore, we explored the molecular mechanism by which miR-489 expression is regulated and found that an lncRNA that we named CHRF acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-489, which downregulates miR-489 expression levels. CHRF is able to directly bind to miR-489 and regulate Myd88 expression and hypertrophy.Our present study reveals a novel cardiac hypertrophy regulating model that is composed of CHRF, miR-489, and Myd88. The modulation of their levels may provide a new approach for tackling cardiac hypertrophy.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557880","annotations":[{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.666597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.643726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.610066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.509175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.489818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.480451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.292117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.172685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.11443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Long non-coding RNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
