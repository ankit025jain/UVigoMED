{"id":21398,"title":"[Analytical procedure of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis and effective use of analysis results for tuberculosis control].","abstract":"Variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis is one of the methods for molecular epidemiological studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. VNTR analysis is a method based on PCR, provides rapid highly reproducible results and higher strain discrimination power than the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis widely used in molecular epidemiological studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Genetic lineage compositions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates differ among the regions from where they are isolated, and allelic diversity at each locus also differs among the genetic lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, the combination of VNTR loci that can provide high discrimination capacity for analysis is not common in every region. The Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association (JATA) 12 (15) reported a standard combination of VNTR loci for analysis in Japan, and the combination with hypervariable (HV) loci added to JATA12 (15), which has very high discrimination capacity, was also reported. From these reports, it is thought that data sharing between institutions and construction of a nationwide database will progress from now on. Using database construction of VNTR profiles, VNTR analysis has become an effective tool to trace the route of tuberculosis infection, and also helps in decision-making in the treatment course. However, in order to utilize the results of VNTR analysis effectively, it is important that each related organization cooperates closely, and analysis should be appropriately applied in the system in which accurate control and private information protection are ensured.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605546","annotations":[{"name":"Variable number tandem repeat","weight":0.903216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_number_tandem_repeat"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.841285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.785599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene pool","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_pool"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.594642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.516453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.465351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.426113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.194121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Tandem repeat","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_repeat"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.119684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"}]}
