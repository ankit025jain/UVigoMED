{"id":52829,"title":"The effect of ovarian puncture on the endocrine profile of PCOS patients who undergo IVM.","abstract":"To examine whether ovarian puncture for immature oocyte retrieval and in-vitro maturation (IVM) has an effect on the endocrine profile of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Twenty-two consecutive patients with PCOS undergoing IVM treatment were included. Serum anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone (TT) and luteinized hormone (LH) levels were analyzed at the start of the cycle, on the day of immature oocyte retrieval (OR) and at fixed intervals thereafter, for up to three months after OR.Five days after OR circulating AMH, TT, calculated free testosterone (FTc), and LH levels were significantly reduced and circulating SHBG was significantly increased. Two weeks after OR, TT, FTc and LH remained reduced, whereas circulating AMH and SHBG levels recovered to pre-puncture values. Three months after OR, all circulating hormone levels had recovered to baseline values.Ovarian puncture for the retrieval of immature oocytes and IVM in patients with PCOS has a significant impact on the ovarian endocrine profile, but this impact is brief and transient.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564914","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sex hormone-binding globulin","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.459931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Transvaginal oocyte retrieval","weight":0.138614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"In vitro maturation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_maturation"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Antimullerian hormone","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimullerian_hormone"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"}]}
