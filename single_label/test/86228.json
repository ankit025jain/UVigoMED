{"id":86228,"title":"Methacholine challenge is insufficient to exclude bronchial hyper-responsiveness in a symptomatic military population.","abstract":"Bronchial hyper-responsiveness in a military population has been evaluated by direct and indirect challenge methods. We hypothesized that negative methacholine challenge testing (MCT) was not sufficient to exclude significant bronchial hyper-responsiveness in a symptomatic military population with exertional dyspnea. The purpose of our study was to identify bronchial hyper-responsiveness in symptomatic military recruits and active duty personnel with normal baseline spirometry and negative pharmacologic bronchoprovocation testing.We performed a retrospective single center electronic chart review of symptomatic service members with a negative MCT who completed a subsequent exercise challenge test (ECT).ECT was positive in 45 (26.4%) of 171 subjects (98 recruits). Subjects with a positive ECT had lower baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC than those with a negative ECT, and these differences were statistically significant. The mean drop in FEV1 with exercise challenge positive patients was 17.9 ± 9.2%, and the mean drop in FEV1 with MCT was significantly greater in exercise challenge positive patients (-9.5 ± 5.5 vs. -7.6 ± 5.5, p = 0.042). Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) was observed in 41% of all recruits who subsequently did not complete training. Only 1 recruit subject of 28 with EIB completed training.Methacholine challenge is an insufficient screening test to detect bronchial hyper-responsiveness in a symptomatic military population. In military recruits, EIB is associated with training failure.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796649","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Bronchoconstriction","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoconstriction"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Bronchial hyperresponsiveness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchial_hyperresponsiveness"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Methacholine","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methacholine"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Exercise intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_intolerance"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"European Investment Bank","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Investment_Bank"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Electroconvulsive therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Active duty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty"},{"name":"Electronic Chart Display and Information System","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Chart_Display_and_Information_System"}]}
