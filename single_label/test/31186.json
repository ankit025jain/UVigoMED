{"id":31186,"title":"Correlates of Protective Motivation Theory (PMT) to adolescents' drug use intention.","abstract":"Early onset and increasing proliferation of illicit adolescent drug-use poses a global health concern. This study aimed to examine the correlation between Protective Motivation Theory (PMT) measures and the intention to use drugs among adolescents. An exploratory quantitative correlation design and convenience sampling were adopted. A total of 318 students completed a self-reported questionnaire that solicited information related to their demographics and activities, measures of threat appraisal and coping appraisal, and the intention to use drugs. Logistic regression analysis showed that intrinsic and extrinsic rewards were significant predictors of intention. The odds ratios were equal to 2.90 (p < 0.05) and 8.04 (p < 0.001), respectively. The logistic regression model analysis resulted in a high Nagelkerke R2 of 0.49, which suggests that PMT related measures could be used in predicting drug use intention among adolescents. Further research should be conducted with non-school adolescents to confirm the application.","date":"2014-01-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24394215","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.837993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Accidental sampling","weight":0.644715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.526862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.462713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.203677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Real estate appraisal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal"},{"name":"Computational electromagnetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_electromagnetics"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Global health","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
