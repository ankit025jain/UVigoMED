{"id":28516,"title":"Cost savings associated with pharmacy student interventions during APPEs.","abstract":"To quantify the impact of pharmacy students' clinical interventions in terms of number and cost savings throughout advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) using a Web-based documentation program.Five hundred eighty doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) students completing ten 4-week APPEs during the final year of the curriculum were asked to document all clinical interventions they made using a Web-based documentation tool. Data were collected over 4 academic years.The total number of interventions made was 59,613, the total dollars saved was $8,583,681, and the average savings per intervention was $148. The top 3 categories of interventions made by students were identifying dosing issues, conducting chart reviews, and recommending appropriate therapy. The top 3 intervention types made by students that resulted in the most dollars saved per intervention were identifying potential allergic reactions, identifying drug interactions, and resolving contraindications.Pharmacy students made important and cost-effective clinical interventions during their APPEs that resulted in significant savings. Documentation programs can track the number, type, and value of the interventions that pharmacy students are making.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24850933","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Curriculum","weight":0.366784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.19349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.181115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.144055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Doctor of Pharmacy","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Pharmacy"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Pharmacy practice","weight":0.0290314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy_practice"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"681","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/681"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
