{"id":92694,"title":"Cardiometabolic biomarkers in chronic plaque psoriasis before and after etanercept treatment.","abstract":"To assess cardiometabolic biomarkers in patients with psoriasis before and after etanercept treatment.Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were randomized to etanercept 50?mg once or twice weekly, double-blinded. Cardiometabolic biomarkers were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment (n?=?273).At baseline, 42% of patients had metabolic syndrome. Etanercept was not associated with any clinically relevant adverse effects on cardiometabolic biomarkers. In the once-weekly subgroup, significant mean percentage changes from baseline (p?<?0.05) were observed for the quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI; -2.2%), apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 (3.2%), Apo B:Apo A1 ratio (-3.5%), leptin (8.6%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (-65.5%); and in the twice-weekly subgroup for plasma insulin (15.9%), QUICKI (-2.7%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; 2.9%), apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 (2.8%), Apo B:Apo A1 (-4.6%) and hsCRP (-74.4%).Metabolic syndrome was common in these patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Etanercept treatment may provide some potentially favorable modulation of insulin sensitivity, HDL-C, Apo A1 and Apo B:Apo A1 ratio.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24219012","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.901907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.741221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Etanercept","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etanercept"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.585621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.547422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.31456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"High-Level Data Link Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Aban","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aban"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"}]}
