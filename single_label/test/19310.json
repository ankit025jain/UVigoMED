{"id":19310,"title":"Therapeutic vaccines for tuberculosis--a systematic review.","abstract":"For eradication of tuberculosis (TB) by 2050, the declared aim of the Stop TB Partnership, novel treatment strategies are indispensable. The emerging epidemic of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB has fuelled the debate about TB vaccines, as increasing numbers of patients can no longer be cured by pharmacotherapy. Of several proposed modalities, TB vaccines administered in therapeutic manner represents a promising alternative, despite the controversial history due to the occurrence of exacerbated immune response. A modified concept of immunotherapy is required in order to justify further exploration. In this paper we systematically reviewed the most advanced therapeutic vaccines for TB. We address the rationale of immunotherapeutic vaccination combined with optimized pharmacotherapy in active TB. We summarize preclinical and patient data regarding the five most advanced therapeutic vaccines currently in the pipeline. Of the five products that have been tested in animal models and in humans during active or latent TB, the quality of the published clinical reports of two of these products justify further studies in patients with active TB. This systematic review fuels further clinical evaluation eventually including head-to-head comparative studies.
