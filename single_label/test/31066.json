{"id":31066,"title":"Alcohol-related morbidity and mortality following involuntary job loss: evidence from Swedish register data.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to assess the association between involuntary job loss and alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality.Swedish linked employee-employer data were used to identify all establishment closures during 1990-1999, as well as the employees who were laid off and a comparison group. These data were merged with information on alcohol-attributable deaths and hospital admissions from the Causes of Death Register and the National Patient Register. The associations between job loss and alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality during a follow-up period of 12 years were estimated by propensity score weighting methods.An excess risk of both alcohol-related hospitalization and mortality was found among both displaced men and women. For women, the wholly alcohol-attributable health problems were mainly limited to alcohol use disorders, whereas men also had an increased risk of hospitalization from poisoning and alcohol-induced liver disease and pancreatitis.The findings support previous evidence of increased risks of alcohol-related morbidity/mortality following involuntary job loss, although the estimates presented herein are more conservative. In addition, the findings suggest that alcohol-related problems manifest somewhat differently in men and women.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411795","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.810769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.718961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.648144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.412202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.382248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.239066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Layoff","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Closure (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Volition (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(psychology)"},{"name":"Register (sociolinguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)"},{"name":"Weighting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Freedom of association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association"}]}
