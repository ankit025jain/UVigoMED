{"id":17010,"title":"[Neurosurgical material-associated infections].","abstract":"Cerebrospinal fluid shunts (CSF) are frequently implanted in acute or chronic hydrocephalus. Intraoperative contamination is the main cause of infection of these devices. Causative germs are found mostly saprophytic (including Staphylococcus sp). The diagnosis can be easy, especially referred to a febrile meningeal syndrome, but also less intense, resulting in valve dysfunction. Therefore, in practice, any patient with CSF shunt should be suspected of being infected thereof, in case of fever and/or new or reappearing neurological symptoms, and until proven otherwise. The treatment is based on high-doses parenteral antibiotherapy, and more often removing the CSF shunt. Infections of cochlear implant are less common, and rarely deep. They are treated surgically by cleaning the surgical site, and in combination with systemic antibiotics. Their conservative treatment can be a concern.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923053","annotations":[{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Meninges","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.59951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.311164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.144235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Saprotrophic nutrition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprotrophic_nutrition"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
