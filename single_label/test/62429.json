{"id":62429,"title":"CD117 (c-kit) expression on CD34+ cells participates in the cytogenetic response to imatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the first chronic phase.","abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) biology seemed to be perfectly explored especially at the beginning of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors era. Later years with imatinib and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors showed a variety of resistance mechanisms and it became obvious that the bcr-abl chimeric gene is not the only enemy to fight. Some studies assumed the decreased rate of programmed cell death (apoptotic) to be the primary mechanism by which BCR-ABL affects expansion of the leukemic clone in CML. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of c-kit inhibition in treatment response.Cytogenetic analysis, real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow-cytometric analysis and imatinib serum level quantification were applied.The percentage of CD34+ cells expressing c-kit (CD117) isolated from bone marrow samples of 54 CML patients treated with standard-dose imatinib was significantly lower among imatinib responders. The fraction of apoptotic CD34+CD117+ cells in this patient group was significantly higher than in nonresponders.To achieve optimal treatment response in CML patients, the elimination of CD34+CD117+ may be necessary through an apoptotic pathway.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577437","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"CD117","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD117"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.856309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.766591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.754704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.597755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.514899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.417045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.168492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
