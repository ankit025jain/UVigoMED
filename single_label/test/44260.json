{"id":44260,"title":"[A case of primary duodenal cancer recurrence successfully treated with CapeOX therapy].","abstract":"A 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of nausea and vomiting. An endoscopic examination and computed tomography(CT)scan revealed a duodenal tumor. A biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of primary duodenal adenocarcinoma. A pancreaticoduodenectomy and partial resection of the ascending colon were performed. Ten months after surgery, we observed lymph node recurrence and peritoneal dissemination. We then introduced capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOX)therapy for treatment of the relapsed disease. A partial response(PR)was observed after 2 courses, and was sustained for 5 months. The patient survived another 1 year and 4 months after disease recurrence. CapeOX therapy can be an effective treatment for primary duodenal cancer.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743368","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.792201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
