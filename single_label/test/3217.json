{"id":3217,"title":"Mesenchymal stromal cell density is increased in higher grade myelodysplastic syndromes and independently predicts survival.","abstract":"We retrospectively tested the prognostic and diagnostic significance of CD271+ mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) density in cytopenic patients who underwent bone marrow biopsy to evaluate for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).CD271+ MSC density was quantitated by automated image analysis of tissue microarray cores in 125 cytopenic patients: 40 lower grade MDS (<5% marrow blasts), 24 higher grade MDS, and 61 benign.CD271+ MSC density was increased in higher grade MDS compared with benign (P = .006) and lower grade MDS (P = .02). CD271+ MSC density was predictive of survival among patients with MDS independent of Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), history of transfusion, therapy-related MDS, and fibrosis (hazard ratio, 3.4; P < .001). Among low or intermediate IPSS-R patients, median survival was significantly shorter in the high CD271+ MSC density group (47 vs 18 months, P < .02).High CD271+ MSC density is characteristic of higher grade MDS and is associated with poor risk independent of known prognostic factors.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25389333","annotations":[{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.638494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.579533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Image analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis"},{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
