{"id":29388,"title":"Pharmacy students' attitudes about treating patients with alcohol addiction after attending a required mutual support group.","abstract":"To implement required attendance at mutual support groups for addiction recovery as a pharmacy skills laboratory exercise, and to evaluate how attendance affected pharmacy students' attitudes about caring for patients with addiction.Third-year (P3) pharmacy students enrolled in a Pharmacy Skills Laboratory course were required to watch an introductory video about Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and then attend 2 \"open meetings\" during the semester. Students submitted a written reflection as proof of attendance.Pharmacy students who agreed to participate in the study completed the Short Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire (SAAPPQ) during the course orientation and again at the end of the semester. Mutual support group attendance significantly affected the students' attitudes within the domains of role adequacy, task specific self-esteem, and work satisfaction. Significant changes were not observed within the domains of motivation and role legitimacy.Mutual support group attendance exposed pharmacy students to the negative effects of alcohol abuse and increased their self-confidence to provide care to patients with alcohol addiction.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672072","annotations":[{"name":"Support group","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Self-esteem","weight":0.735704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.720698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.708486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.181098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Academic term","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"Watch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch"},{"name":"Alcohol proof","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_proof"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Mutual Broadcasting System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Broadcasting_System"},{"name":"Full motion video based game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_motion_video_based_game"},{"name":"Exhibition game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game"},{"name":"Domain name","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"},{"name":"Introspection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection"},{"name":"Legitimacy (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(law)"}]}
