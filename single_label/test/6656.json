{"id":6656,"title":"Tanshinol protects hippocampus and attenuates vascular dementia development.","abstract":"Tanshinol (3-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-(2R)-lactic acid, TSL) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Here, we assessed whether TSL protected hippocampus and attenuated vascular dementia (VD) development in rats. The behavioral analysis showed that TSL could decrease the distance and latency time, and increase the swim speed in water maze in rats subjected to VD. TSL remarkably increased acetylcholine level and decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in rats subjected to VD. Likewise, TSL remarkably decreased malondialdehyde and increased superoxide dismutase levels in rats subjected to VD. Furthermore, treatment with TSL reduced the level of dead neurons in dentate gyrus. In addition, TSL upregulated growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and downregulated phosphorylated Akt (p-AKt) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (p-GSK3?) expression in hippocampus in rats subjected to VD. These results suggest that TSL may be a potential compound in VD model.
