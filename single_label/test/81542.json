{"id":81542,"title":"[Prevalence of dental caries: national pilot study comparing the severity of decay (CAO) vs ICDAS index in Senegal].","abstract":"This pilot study has for main objective to measure the applicability and the utility of ICDAS index in a context of prevention in developing countries. Dental caries prevalence was evaluated among schoolchildren using DMF (WHO basic method) vs. ICDAS index in Senegal.A representative stratified random cluster sample of 677 primary and college schoolchildren aged 12 and 15 years was examined for caries prevalence. The clinical examination was conducted in two steps for each. The investigator proceeded at first to the inventory of the number of teeth decayed (D), missing (M) or filled (F) according to the WHO basic method. Then, after cleaning and drying all teeth, a two-digit ICDAS code was used to record data at each dental surface.Caries prevalence (96%) was higher than expected in Senegal. ICDAS index provides 43% moreover information than DMF. The need for prevention (ICDAS1: 66%/72% and ICDAS2: 54%/58%) and intercept (ICDAS3: 40%/42% and ICDAS4: 31%/33%) are higher than the need of curative treatment (ICDAS5: 18%/23% and ICDAS6: 27%/33%) respectively among primary and college schoolchildren.Preventive programs are urgently needed in Senegal. It's necessary to lead epidemiological studies in other African countries for determining caries prevalence using the ICDAS criteria to harmonize oral health regional planning.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979961","annotations":[{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.936804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.796038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.579993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.523343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.430882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.225493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.170223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Senegal","weight":0.154109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Detective","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"1823","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1823"},{"name":"Harmony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
