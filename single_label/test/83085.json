{"id":83085,"title":"[Dental status and related factors in an occupational health service in Northern France].","abstract":"Few data are available concerning the dental health of adults in France. This study was designed to describe dental status, oral health behaviour and factors associated with caries among workers followed by an occupational health service in Northern France.A representative sample of workers was selected between May and July 2006. Data were collected by occupational health physicians using a questionnaire completed during a face-to-face interview and a dental examination. After descriptive analysis of the variables, two groups were defined according to the degree of caries as assessed by the Significant Caries Index. Factors associated with the degree of caries were investigated using logistic regression adjusted to age.420 workers with a mean age of 34.6(±10.4) years were included. The mean DMFT (Decayed Missing Filled Teeth) score and the mean number of decayed teeth were 8.9 (± 6.5) and 1.3 (±2.8), respectively. Three independent factors associated with high caries rates were identified: level of education less than Baccalaureate (ORa = 1.85; p < 0.05), regular consumption of sweet snacks and/or sweet drinks (ORa = 2.01; p < 0.05) and a last dental visit motivated by pain or a reason other than preventive care (ORa = 1.89; p < 0.05).This study showed a high need for care and oral health education in this population of workers. More oral health education programmes should be set up in the adult working population by occupational health services.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451420","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.798628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.729275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.673986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.636805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.543623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.416595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.314662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Bachelor's degree","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0352563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Confectionery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Snack food","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack_food"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"}]}
