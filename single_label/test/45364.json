{"id":45364,"title":"Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy using a hemi-double-stapling technique.","abstract":"The double-stapling technique (DST) is frequently used in laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. Unfortunately, anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis with DST is seen with some frequency.We performed DST on 40 patients (June 2007 to August 2008) and hemi-DST on 50 patients (September 2008 to December 2011) undergoing laparoscopic sigmoidectomy.There were no occurrences of anastomotic leakage in the hemi-DST group, and 2 instances of anastomotic leakage in the DST group were observed. In these patients, the leakage appeared at the lateral intersecting anastomotic margins.Using the hemi-DST for laparoscopic intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis will make laparoscopic sigmoidectomy a safer procedure.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686359","annotations":[{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Daylight saving time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
