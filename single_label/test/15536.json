{"id":15536,"title":"MRSA care in the community: why patient education matters.","abstract":"In primary care, patients are prescribed decolonisation treatment to eradicate meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This complex treatment process requires the patient to apply a topical antimicrobial treatment as well as adhering to rigorous cleaning regimens to ensure the environment is effectively managed. A pilot study was carried out that involved developing an enhanced, nurse-delivered education tool, training a community nurse to use it, then testing its use with a patient. Three interviews were carried out: one with a patient who received usual care, one with a patient who received the enhanced education and one with the community nurse who delivered the enhanced education tool. The patient who received the enhanced education reported better knowledge and understanding of the application of treatment than the patient who did not. These results are interesting and point the way forward for larger research studies to build on the learning from this limited exploration and develop more effective management of MRSA in primary care.
