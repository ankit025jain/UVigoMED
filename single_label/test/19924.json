{"id":19924,"title":"Scaling up prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV infection to primary health facilities in Nigeria: findings from two primary health centres in Northwest Nigeria.","abstract":"Nigeria is scaling up prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV interventions to primary health care centres (PHCs). This retrospective study of PMTCT was at two PHCs in Northwest Nigeria with the main outcome measure being HIV infection rate of exposed infants at 6 weeks of life. Of 10,289 women who had antenatal HIV test, 74 had positive results. This gave a prevalence of 0.7%. The uptake of antenatal (99.8%) and intrapartum (97.3%) tests was high at both centres. 30% of HIV infected mothers and 25% of exposed infants were lost to follow-up (LFU). Most women (85.7%) had highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and vaginal delivery (98%). Perinatal mortality rate was 66/1000 births and 95.3% of exposed infants had negative HIV-DNA polymerase reaction test at 6 weeks of life. Despite a high LFU, a new vista has been opened to attaining a zero infection rate.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689324","annotations":[{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.797466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.722106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.693902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.638544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.552922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.531511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Vertical transmission","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_transmission"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.403583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.352246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.273935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Medical facility","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_facility"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Criminal transmission of HIV","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_transmission_of_HIV"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest"}]}
