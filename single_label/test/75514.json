{"id":75514,"title":"Shared decision-making about assistive technology for the child with severe neurologic impairment.","abstract":"Shared decision-making is a process that helps frame conversations about value-sensitive decisions, such as introduction of assistive technology for children with neurologic impairment. In the shared decision-making model, the health care provider elicits family values relevant to the decision, provides applicable evidence in the context of those values, and collaborates with the family to identify the preferred option. This article outlines clinical, quality of life, and ethical considerations for shared decision-making discussions with families of children with neurologic impairment about gastrostomy tube and tracheostomy tube placement.
