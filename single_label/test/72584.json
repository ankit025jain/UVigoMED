{"id":72584,"title":"Synthesis and evaluation of bisbenzylidenedioxotetrahydrothiopranones as activators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling pathways and apoptotic cell death in acute promyelocytic leukemic cells.","abstract":"Curcumin is known to trigger ER-stress induced cell death of acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) cells by intercepting the degradation of nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) protein which has a key role in the pathogenesis of APL. Replacing the heptadienedione moiety of curcumin with a monocarbonyl cross-conjugated dienone embedded in a tetrahydrothiopyranone dioxide ring resulted in thiopyranone dioxides that were more resilient to hydrolysis and had greater growth inhibitory activities than curcumin on APL cells. Several members intercepted the degradation of misfolded N-CoR and triggered the signaling cascade in the unfolded protein response (UPR) which led to apoptotic cell death. Microarray analysis showed that genes involved in protein processing pathways that were germane to the activation of the UPR were preferentially up-regulated in treated APL cells, supporting the notion that the UPR was a consequential mechanistic pathway affected by thiopyranone dioxides. The Michael acceptor reactivity of the scaffold may have a role in exacerbating ER stress in APL cells.
