{"id":89245,"title":"A distal airway foreign body removed with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy.","abstract":"Distal airway foreign bodies can be challenging to remove with a flexible bronchoscope because of angulation or deep impaction. Thoracic surgery may be required if bronchoscopy is not successful. The use of electromagnetic navigation for pulmonary nodule localization and characterization is well established; however, its use to localize and remove distal foreign bodies has not been described. We report the initial case of electromagnetic navigation-assisted foreign body removal.
