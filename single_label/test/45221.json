{"id":45221,"title":"Argon plasma coagulation in the right and left colon: safety-risk profile of the 60W-1.2 l/min setting.","abstract":"The 40W-0.8 l/min setting is widely recommended for argon plasma coagulation (APC) in the right colon. Until March 2012, we used the 60W-1.2 l/min setting for all sites of the colon. By auditing our experience, we assessed the safety-risk profile of the 60W-1.2 l/min setting in the right and left colon.All cases treated with APC by a single endoscopist, using the 60W-1.2 l/min setting for all sites of the colon between October 2001 and December 2007 were identified retrospectively and site, type, number of lesions, and complications were recorded. Between January 2008 and March 2012, information was recorded prospectively.In the retrospective audit, 290 lesions (101 cecum/ascending, 120 sigmoid/descending, 69 transverse) were treated in 241 patient endoscopies. There were no perforations. In the prospective audit, 156 lesions (83 cecum/ascending, 47 sigmoid/descending, 26 transverse) were treated in 132 patient endoscopies. There was 1/83 (1.2%) perforation in the cecum/ascending colon and none in the transverse or sigmoid/descending (n.s.). Combined, the results yield a cecal/ascending perforation rate of 1/153 (0.6%) patient endoscopies, 1/184 (0.5%) lesions treated and overall perforation rate for all sites of the colon of 1/373 (0.3%) patient endoscopies and 1/446 (0.2%) lesions. Post-polypectomy syndrome and delayed bleeding each occurred in 3/373 (0.8%) patient endoscopies and 3/446 (0.7%) lesions. There were no deaths.In the cecum and ascending colon, the APC perforation rate at the 60W-1.2 l/min setting was no higher than in the left colon and is similar to that reported in previously published series. Therefore, it appears safe, provided the precautions we describe are strictly followed.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694332","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.77277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.765245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.620992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.537219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Argon plasma coagulation","weight":0.359541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon_plasma_coagulation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.319099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Argon","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"},{"name":"Ascending colon","weight":0.210579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_colon"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"1153","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1153"},{"name":"1446","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1446"},{"name":"1184","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1184"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Adenomatous polyposis coli","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomatous_polyposis_coli"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"}]}
