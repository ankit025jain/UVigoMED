{"id":20760,"title":"Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection in Australian hospitals: findings from a Victorian surveillance system.","abstract":"To determine the burden of disease and trend over time for rates of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream (SAB) infections in Victorian health care services.Uniform data on all SAB infection events (methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant isolates) were collected from all public and some private hospitals in Victoria using a standardised electronic data collection tool. Data were analysed for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012.Overall and quarterly aggregate SAB and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection rates per 10,000 occupied bed-days (OBDs); rates of health care-associated (HA) infections compared with a benchmark of no more than 2/10,000 OBDs.Data from 119 public and four private hospitals were analysed. The cumulative aggregate SAB infection rate was 1.0/10,000 OBDs (95% CI, 0.9-1.0/10,000 OBDs). Overall, 1335/3205 SAB infection events (41.7%) were health care-associated. Of these, 26.2% occurred within 48 hours of hospitalisation and were most frequently associated with an indwelling medical device. Quarterly HA-SAB infection rates diminished from 1.4 to 0.7/10,000 OBDs (P < 0.001). A median of four health care services each quarter exceeded the benchmark of 2.0/10,000 OBDs. HA-MRSA bloodstream infection rates diminished from 0.4 to 0.1/10,000 OBDs (P < 0.001), with a cumulative aggregate rate of 0.2/10,000 OBDs.Continuous surveillance for SAB infection showed a significant reduction in rates across Victoria during the first 3 years of a coordinated program. Early onset, device-related SAB infections are an important target for prevention strategies.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641154","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.739962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.578049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Victoria (Australia)","weight":0.237679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.163889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Victorian era","weight":0.146078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Magazine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Benchmarking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking"},{"name":"Immanence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Data (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"}]}
