{"id":86857,"title":"Interim estimates of the effectiveness of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in preventing influenza hospitalisations and primary care visits in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2014.","abstract":"We present preliminary results of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in New Zealand using a case test-negative design for 28 April to 31 August 2014. VE adjusted for age and time of admission among all ages against severe acute respiratory illness hospital presentation due to laboratory-confirmed influenza was 54% (95% CI: 19 to 74) and specifically against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 65% (95% CI:33 to 81). For influenza-confirmed primary care visits, VE was 67% (95% CI: 48 to 79) overall and 73% (95% CI: 50 to 85) against A(H1N1)pdm09.","date":"2014-10-31","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358042","annotations":[{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.812907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.337757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.328606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"AH1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH1"},{"name":"Auckland","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"Islamic calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
