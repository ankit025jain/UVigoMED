{"id":77902,"title":"Is complex signal processing for bone conduction hearing aids useful?","abstract":"To establish whether complex signal processing is beneficial for users of bone anchored hearing aids.Review and analysis of two studies from our own group, each comparing a speech processor with basic digital signal processing (either Baha Divino or Baha Intenso) and a processor with complex digital signal processing (either Baha BP100 or Baha BP110 power). The main differences between basic and complex signal processing are the number of audiologist accessible frequency channels and the availability and complexity of the directional multi-microphone noise reduction and loudness compression systems.Both studies show a small, statistically non-significant improvement of speech understanding in quiet with the complex digital signal processing. The average improvement for speech in noise is +0.9 dB, if speech and noise are emitted both from the front of the listener. If noise is emitted from the rear and speech from the front of the listener, the advantage of the devices with complex digital signal processing as opposed to those with basic signal processing increases, on average, to +3.2 dB (range +2.3 â€¦ +5.1 dB, p ? 0.0032).Complex digital signal processing does indeed improve speech understanding, especially in noise coming from the rear. This finding has been supported by another study, which has been published recently by a different research group.When compared to basic digital signal processing, complex digital signal processing can increase speech understanding of users of bone anchored hearing aids. The benefit is most significant for speech understanding in noise.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24869443","annotations":[{"name":"Digital signal processing","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Data compression","weight":0.75928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression"},{"name":"Signal processing","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing"},{"name":"Speech processing","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_processing"},{"name":"Harmonic","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic"},{"name":"Central processing unit","weight":0.732642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"},{"name":"Channel (communications)","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(communications)"},{"name":"Signaling (telecommunications)","weight":0.706124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_(telecommunications)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Noise reduction","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction"},{"name":"Loudness","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.639178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Digital signal","weight":0.570467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.356605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.346926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.340474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.336834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Audio signal processing","weight":0.219691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bone conduction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Surround sound","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"},{"name":"Directional antenna","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_antenna"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"}]}
