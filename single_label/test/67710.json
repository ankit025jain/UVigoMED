{"id":67710,"title":"Psychotherapeutic intervention with hypnosis in 554 couples with reproductive failure.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy of psychotherapeutic intervention including hypnotherapy in couples with \"unexplained\" reproductive failure. The study was based on a prospective clinical model set at a Trust Hospital. The couples with reproductive failure reported for treatment. Over a period of 28 years, 554 couples without any anatomical or physiological anomaly were studied. Psychotherapeutic intervention with indirect and direct hypnosis was added to the standard protocol for investigation and therapy of infertile couples. Several stressors were identified. Stress of barrenness was seen in 100% of women. Other stressors of marital life were identified. Hypnotherapy was targeted at general stress relief initially and, towards the specific stressor/s subsequently. The results were judged as success in terms of occurrence of pregnancy. The success rate was 71.67%. There could not have been a double blind study. However, 349/554 came after failing elsewhere. They had the same success rate ie, 70%. A persistent, unprecedented high success rate establishes that \"unexplained\" reproductive failure is psychodynamically triggered, is reversible with psychotherapy that includes hypnosis. The study explains causation in terms of psychosomatic stress. When that is alleviated with hypnotherapy, there are remarkable results.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592756","annotations":[{"name":"Psychosomatic medicine","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine"},{"name":"Hypnosis","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypnotherapy","weight":0.781984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotherapy"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.637455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Stress management","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.523117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.438101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.346395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Psychodynamics","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Double blind","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_blind"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trust (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)"}]}
