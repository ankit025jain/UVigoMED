{"id":19179,"title":"Is there an association between periprosthetic joint infection and low vitamin D levels?","abstract":"Vitamin D is increasingly being recognized as an important mediator of immune function and may have a preventive role in the pathogenesis of periprosthetic joint infection. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has examined possible associations between periprosthetic joint infection and vitamin D deficiency. We investigated the rate of vitamin D deficiency in patients treated for periprosthetic joint infection and whether vitamin D deficiency is independent of other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in patients with periprosthetic joint infection.Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels of every patient scheduled to receive a total prosthesis either of the hip, knee, or shoulder in the orthopaedic department of the Johannes-Guttenberg-University Hospital in Mainz, Germany (109 patients), were measured after admission. Furthermore, serum 25OHD levels were measured for every patient presenting with periprosthetic joint infection (n = 50) or aseptic loosening of the prosthesis (n = 31) scheduled to undergo revision surgery. The prevalence of normal (> 30 ng/ml), insufficient (20-30 ng/ml), and deficient (<20 ng/ml) 25OHD levels was determined.All tested patient subgroups showed low vitamin D levels. Statistical analysis found no significant difference in vitamin D levels comparing patients with prosthesis and patients with aseptic prosthesis loosening (p = 0.58). Significant differences in 25OHD levels were found comparing patients with periprosthetic joint infection and patients scheduled for primary arthroplasty (p < 0.001). In addition, we found a significant difference (p < 0,001) in 25OHD levels of patients with periprosthetic joint infection compared with patients with aseptic prosthesis loosening.We found a high frequency of vitamin D deficiency in patients being treated by primary arthroplasty and those with aseptic joint prosthetic loosening and periprosthetic joint infection. Vitamin D deficiency was severe in patients with periprosthetic joint infection.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737149","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.715535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.701877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.628119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.543806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.334377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.274118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.204947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.196415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.126721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0612705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Mainz","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
