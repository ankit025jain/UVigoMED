{"id":43725,"title":"High-resolution analysis of DNA copy number alterations in rectal cancer: correlation with metastasis, survival, and mRNA expression.","abstract":"This study aimed to determine the candidate genes and chromosomal imbalances capable of predicting occurrences of metastasis in patients with rectal cancer.Fresh frozen tumor tissues from 80 patients with rectal cancer were prospectively collected and analyzed using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression arrays and high-resolution Illumina single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Endpoints of the study were metastasis-free survival (MFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).The median follow-up was 102 months (1-146). Deletions of 8p and 1p36-35 correlated with worse MFS (p?=?0.005 and p?=?0.01, respectively) and CSS (p?=?0.001 and p?=?0.01, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified 8p deletion as an independent prognostic factor for MFS (p?=?0.04) and CSS (p?=?0.003); 97 genes located on the 8p chromosome were significantly underexpressed in tumors with 8p deletion.This study shows for the first time in rectal cancer an independent correlation of 8p deletion with MFS and CSS and highlights potential new tumor suppressor genes.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770938","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.809329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Affymetrix","weight":0.778221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affymetrix"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.775131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Illumina (company)","weight":0.762811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_(company)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.544491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.365779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chromosome 1 (human)","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_1_(human)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"}]}
