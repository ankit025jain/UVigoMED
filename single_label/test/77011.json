{"id":77011,"title":"[High intensity interval training improves glycemic control and aerobic capacity in glucose intolerant patients].","abstract":"Proper exercise training modifies intra miocellular energy utilization, glucose transport and mitochondrial biogenesis.To determine the therapeutic effects of a high intensity intermittent training (HIIT) program on glucose homeostasis, physical fitness and body fat in glucose intolerant patients.Eighteen patients with overweight or obesity and glucose intolerance were invited to participate in an exercise program consisting in three sessions per week for 3 months. Ten participants aged 35 ± 13 years who attended > 26 of the planned 36 sessions, were considered as adherent to exercise. The other eight participants aged 37 ± 17 years, who attended to a mean of 13 sessions, were considered as non-adherent. Both groups had similar body weight, body mass index, body fat, plasma glucose 2 h after an oral glucose load and maximal oxygen uptake. All these variables were measured at the end of exercise intervention. Each session consisted of 1 min exercise of cycling at maximal intensity until muscle fatigue followed by 2 min rest, repeated 10 times.Among adherent participants, twelve weeks of HIIT improved significantly maximal oxygen uptake (6.1 + 3.6 mL/kg/min or 24.6%), reduced 2 h post load blood glucose (-33.7 + 47.9 mg/dL or -12.5%) and body fat (-4.3 + 5.6 kg). No significant changes were observed in the non-adherent group.HIIT exercise reduces blood glucose after an oral load in glucose intolerant patients.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Nutritional and
