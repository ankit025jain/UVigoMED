{"id":87863,"title":"[Treatment of Herbert B2-type scaphoid fracture with double screws prograde internal fixation through volar approach].","abstract":"To explore the clinical and function efficacy of the treatment of Herbert B2-type scaphoid fracture through volar approach with double screws prograde internal fixation.From December 2005 to June 2010,18 patients with Herbert B2-type scaphoid fracture were treated with double screws prograde internal fixation through volar approach, including 14 males and 4 females with an average age of 33.11 years (ranged from 21 to 52 years). The fracture healing situation was evaluated by X-ray examination. Functional outcome was assessed by using Modified Mayo wrist score.All patients were followed up with a mean time of (25.06 +/- 4.00) months. The bone healing time was (3.55 +/- 0.65) months. The pain,passive range of motion, grip of wrist were improved at 4 months after operation (P < 0.05). The Mayo wrist score were improved from preoperative 42.78 +/- 7.32 at 4 months after operation (93.89 +/- 5.83) (P < 0.05), the results were excellent in 9 cases and good in 9 cases.Volar approach with double screws prograde internal fixation is an efficacy and safety surgical technique for Herbert B2-type scaphoid fracture.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974421","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.567451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Scaphoid fracture","weight":0.503889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.474758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.235995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.17835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Scaphoid bone","weight":0.144746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_bone"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Volar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volar"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"}]}
