{"id":82612,"title":"[Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw-after a decade has passed].","abstract":"It has been passed 10 years since the first article of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) was reported in 2003. During this period of time, turmoil and confusion initially seen in physicians, dentists and patients in the management of BRONJ have been gradually and significantly settling and preventive methods for BRONJ have been developed to some extent due to the accumulation of substantial amounts of information and clinical experience. Further, Japanese version of position paper for BRONJ that suggests unified view of the pathophysiology of BRONJ and consistent treatments of BRONJ was published in 2010 and 2012. However, the mechanism and pathophysiology of BRONJ still remain elusive. The recognition for BRONJ is still inconsistent between physicians and dentists. It is also noted that a new anti-resorptive drug denosumab is associated with ONJ. Thus, there are still lots to learn and study. In this chapter current our understanding of BRONJ will be described.
