{"id":73703,"title":"Glycolysis inhibition and its effect in doxorubicin resistance in neuroblastoma.","abstract":"A common trait among cancers is the increased level of glycolysis despite adequate oxygen levels to support aerobic respiration. This has been shown repeatedly in different human malignancies. Glycolysis inhibitors, especially 3-bromopyruvate, have been shown to be effective chemotherapeutic agents. The effect of glycolysis inhibition upon chemotherapy resistance is relatively unknown.Wild-type and doxorubicin-resistant lines of neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH and SK-N-Be(2)C) were used in this study. Using an MTT assay, the IC50 of 3-BrPA was determined. Subsequently, doxorubicin-resistant cell lines were treated with 3-bromopyruvate, doxorubicin, and 3-bromopyruvate with doxorubicin. Additionally, a luminescence ATP detection assay was used to measure intracellular ATP levels, and a lactate assay was used to determine intracellular lactate levels. All experiments were repeated in hypoxic conditions.Treatment with 3-bromopyruvate and doxorubicin significantly decreased the mean cell viabilities at 24, 48, and 72hours in normoxic conditions. A similar response was replicated in hypoxic conditions. Treatment with 3-bromopyruvate significantly decreased intracellular ATP and lactate levels.Glycolysis inhibitors such as 3-bromopyruvate could prove to become an effective means by which chemotherapy resistance can be overcome in human neuroblastoma.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888847","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.914325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Cellular respiration","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.865249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.858534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.809323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.738829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.734351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.696058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.587498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.413243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Bromopyruvic acid","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromopyruvic_acid"},{"name":"Hypoxia (environmental)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Luminescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescence"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"}]}
