{"id":61037,"title":"[Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma].","abstract":"Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCL) present as skin lesions without evidence of extracutaneous involvement at diagnosis. This article summarizes clinical and histopathological features of the three main types of PCBCL: primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma, primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type. It will discuss initial staging procedures, necessary to differentiate PCBCL from systemic lymphoma with secondary skin involvement. Finally, we will review the main treatments, local therapy (radiotherapy, surgical excision) for indolent PCBCL and multiagent chemotherapy for primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772806","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.786849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.238744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
