{"id":60135,"title":"[Treatment of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease with rituximab].","abstract":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is one of the main complications after stem cell transplantation and is often induced by EBV. The optimal treatment of PTLD includes reduction of immunosuppressant dose, transplant organ resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and so on. Recently, a new therapeutic approach was developed in PTLD: the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody or rituximab. In this review, the application of rituximab in treatment of PTLD is summarized, including risk factors and mechanism of PTLD, therapeutic strategy, application of rituximab in PTLD and so on.
