{"id":36695,"title":"In utero delivery of oligodeoxynucleotides for gene correction.","abstract":"Gene correction is attractive for single gene mutation disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The mdx mouse model of DMD is dystrophin deficient due to a premature chain-terminating point mutation in exon 23 of the dystrophin gene. Gene editing of genomic DNA using single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) offers the potential to change the DNA sequence to alter mRNA and protein expression in defined ways. When applied to fetal skeletal muscle of mdx mice in utero, this technology leads to restoration of dystrophin protein expression, thus providing a valid gene-based therapeutic application at the earliest developmental stage. Here, we describe detailed methods for gene editing using muscle delivery of ssODNs to the fetal mdx mouse in utero at embryonic day 16 and to test correction of dystrophin deficiency at different ages after birth.
