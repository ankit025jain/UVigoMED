{"id":68052,"title":"Complications of the 'Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Programme' following pedicled vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in perineum reconstruction.","abstract":"The enhanced recovery programme, pioneered in the colorectal surgical setting, aims to reduce the length of inpatient stay following a procedure and was started in our trust in 2006. We present the case of a patient who underwent perineal reconstruction with a pedicled vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous (VRAM) who subsequently developed bladder outflow obstruction compromising flap viability. As a result of our experience we are in the process of producing new guidelines that advocate patients undergoing a VRAM flap for perineal reconstruction should be exempt from aspects of the enhanced recovery programme, in particular early removal of the catheter should be avoided.
