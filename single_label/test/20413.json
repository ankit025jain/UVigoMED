{"id":20413,"title":"Bacteremic skin and soft tissue infection caused by Prevotella loescheii.","abstract":"Anaerobes are a major component of gut flora. They play an important role in the pathogenesis of infections resulting from breaches in mucus membranes. Because of the difficulties in cultivating and identifying it, their role continues to be undermined. The purpose of this paper is to report a case of Prevotella loescheii bacteremic skin and soft tissue infection and review the literature.A 42-year-old Caucasian man was admitted for an elective bariatric surgery. A lengthy intensive care unit stay and buttocks decubitus ulcers complicated his post-operative course. After being transferred to a long-term care facility, the decubitus ulcer became secondarily infected with multiple bacteria including P. loescheii; an anaerobe that grew in blood and wound cultures. The patient was treated successfully with aggressive surgical debridement, antibiotics and subsequent wound care.P. loescheii colonizes the gut and plays an important role in periodontal infections. In rare occasions and under suitable circumstances, it can infect skin and soft tissues as well as joints. Given the difficulties in isolating anaerobes in the microbiology lab, considering this bacterium alongside other anaerobes in infections of devitalized tissue is indicated even if cultures were reported negative.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661318","annotations":[{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.902106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.855549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.780994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.736716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.709983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.630946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.165023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.0853846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Colonisation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonisation_(biology)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
