{"id":25771,"title":"Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition versus enalapril in heart failure.","abstract":"We compared the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 with enalapril in patients who had heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. In previous studies, enalapril improved survival in such patients.In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 8442 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either LCZ696 (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily), in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial was designed to detect a difference in the rates of death from cardiovascular causes.The trial was stopped early, according to prespecified rules, after a median follow-up of 27 months, because the boundary for an overwhelming benefit with LCZ696 had been crossed. At the time of study closure, the primary outcome had occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001). A total of 711 patients (17.0%) receiving LCZ696 and 835 patients (19.8%) receiving enalapril died (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P<0.001); of these patients, 558 (13.3%) and 693 (16.5%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P<0.001). As compared with enalapril, LCZ696 also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 21% (P<0.001) and decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure (P=0.001). The LCZ696 group had higher proportions of patients with hypotension and nonserious angioedema but lower proportions with renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough than the enalapril group.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176015","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperkalemia","weight":0.92372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkalemia"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Angioedema","weight":0.610145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.585517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Enalapril","weight":0.486111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enalapril"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.478001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.391224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0183746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"558","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/558"},{"name":"835","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/835"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"1117","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1117"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Myosin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
