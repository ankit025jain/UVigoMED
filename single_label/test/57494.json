{"id":57494,"title":"Predictive value of fetal fibronectin on the embryonic loss of patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy.","abstract":"This work aims to investigate the predictive value of fetal fibronectin (fFN) in embryonic loss of patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) in early pregnancy.Eighty-four patients with RSA in early pregnancy were selected as the test group and 31 healthy women in early pregnancy were selected as the control group. The ages and number of previous abortions, along with other information, were recorded. These patients underwent a fFN test, and their pregnancy outcome was followed up until 14 weeks.The incidence of spontaneous abortion was 20.24% in the test group and 9.68% in the control group. The positive fFN [fFN (+)] rate was 57.14% in the test group and 12.90% in the control group, indicating a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01, chi2 = 17.89). The incidence of spontaneous abortion was 29.17% (14/48) in the fFN (+) group and 8.33% (3/36) in the fFN (-) group, indicating a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05, chi2 = 5.53). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values in the prediction of abortion in fFN (+) patients of the test group were 82.35%, 49.25%, 29.17%, and 91.67%, respectively.If detected at an early stage of pregnancy, fFN in patients with RSA is largely related to the prediction of abortion and facilitates the evaluation of pregnancy outcomes.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134280","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.554488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.480865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.424062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.223991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.197363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.186252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"1448","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1448"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Teenage pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy"}]}
