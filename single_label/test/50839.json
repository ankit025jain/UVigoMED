{"id":50839,"title":"The pharmacokinetic considerations and adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors [corrected].","abstract":"Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a class of anti-hyperglycemic agents with proven efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).This review considers the pharmacokinetic profile, adverse effects and drug interactions of DPP-4 inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors have certain differences in their structure, metabolism, route of elimination and selectivity for DPP-4 over structurally related enzymes, such as DPP-8/DPP-9. They have a low potential for drug interactions, with the exception of saxagliptin that is largely metabolized by cytochrome CYP3A4/A5. Reports of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer have raised concerns regarding the safety of DPP-4 inhibitors and are under investigation. Post-marketing surveillance has revealed less common adverse effects, especially a number of skin- and immune-related adverse effects. These issues are covered in the present review.DPP-4 inhibitors are useful and efficient drugs. DPP-4 inhibitors have similar mechanism of action and similar efficacy. However, DPP-4 inhibitors have certain differences in their pharmacokinetic properties that may be associated with different clinical effects and adverse event profiles. Although clinical trials indicated a favorable safety profile, post-marketing reports revealed certain safety aspects that need further investigation. Certainly, more research is needed to clarify if the differences among DPP-4 inhibitors could lead to a different clinical and safety profile.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746233","annotations":[{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"CYP3A4","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"DPP8","weight":0.672847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP8"},{"name":"DPP9","weight":0.672847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP9"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.644154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.64351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Saxagliptin","weight":0.617295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxagliptin"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.436844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Postmarketing surveillance","weight":0.409216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmarketing_surveillance"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"}]}
