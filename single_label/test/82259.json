{"id":82259,"title":"[Effect of casein osphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate solution in preventing enamel demineralization].","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of casein osphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) in preventing enamel demineralization.Enamel blocks were prepared from premolars extracted from orthodontic patients. The specimens were treated for 30 min daily for 7 days with one of the following agents: deionized water (negative control), CPP-ACP paste, and NaF solutions (positive controls) (0.2% and 2%). After the treatments, the specimens were immersed in a demineralizing solution (pH 4.5) for 7 days. The morphology and depth of the lesion were observed using scanning electron microscopy, and the content of Ca, P, Mg in the demineralized enamel was measured by electron probe micro-analyzer.The demineralization rates in all the treatment groups were significantly smaller than those in the control group after 7 days of demineralization.The application of CPP-ACP to the enamel surfaces can inhibit enamel demineralization with an equivalent effect to 0.2% NaF.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670465","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.779676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.750234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Casein","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.710553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.700897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.685059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.512566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.508647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.491108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.457549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.394416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Purified water","weight":0.36559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.293195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.172396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.163204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"}]}
