{"id":81490,"title":"Post-operative complications following dental extractions at the School of Dentistry, University of Otago.","abstract":"To determine the frequency and correlates associations of post-extraction complications at a dental school.Retrospective review of patient records.Exodontia clinic at the School of Dentistry, University of Otago, Dunedin.Provider characteristics, patient demographic characteristics, patient medical history, teeth extracted and occurrence of postoperative complications.Of the 598 extractions (540 routine and 58 surgical) which were undertaken in the audit period, 74 (12.4%) resulted in post-operative complications. Dry socket and post-operative pain were the major complications. A higher complication rate was found among patients treated by fourth-year undergraduate students than among those treated by more senior students or staff. Post-operative complications were not significantly associated with patients' ethnicity or medical history.The rate of postoperative complications at the Univeristy of Otago's Faculty of Dentistry is consistent with reports in existing literature and inversely associated with operators' experience.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000807","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.663374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.345673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Undergraduate education","weight":0.315461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education"},{"name":"School","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"History","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.237679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.225489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dunedin","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin"},{"name":"University of Otago","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Otago"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Dental school","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_school"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Alveolar osteitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_osteitis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Alexandria University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_University"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
