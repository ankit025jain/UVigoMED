{"id":61630,"title":"Remission of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia after lung cancer resection.","abstract":"Secondary immune thrombocytopenia is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome of lung cancer. We report a case of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma with newly diagnosed secondary immune thrombocytopenia. On referral, the patient's complete blood cell count was normal; however, it showed marked thrombocytopenia after 1 month. Blood biochemistry and bone marrow puncture showed normal findings. We speculated that he had immune thrombocytopenia associated with the lung cancer and planned lung resection. Sleeve middle and lower lobectomy was successfully performed with preoperative intravenous immunoglobulin and intraoperative platelet transfusion. His platelet count was restored and maintained a normal level at 8 months after the operation.
