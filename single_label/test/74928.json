{"id":74928,"title":"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) as a complication of immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in children.","abstract":"Although kidney transplantation is by far the best method of renal replacement therapy, organ receiver is still not spared of eventual toxic consequences of drugs that are in charge of keeping the transplanted kidney functional. Both calcineurin inhibitors, of which tacrolimus more often, occasionally lead to neurotoxic side effects, mostly mild and reversible and dose-dependent in nature, but they can also be very severe or even fatal. It is very important to be aware of possible neurotoxic effects, to confirm them radiologically, and to prevent or reduce drug effects on nervous system. Sometimes the reduction of dose or substitution with another drug with similar mechanism effect is sufficient to terminate the neurotoxic effects of the drug and still not jeopardize the function of transplanted organ.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195358","annotations":[{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.817794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.741545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.6919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.580046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.300978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_reversible_encephalopathy_syndrome"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
