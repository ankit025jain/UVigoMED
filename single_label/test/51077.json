{"id":51077,"title":"Do nitric oxide-releasing drugs offer a potentially new paradigm for the management of cardiovascular risks in diabetes?","abstract":"Cardiovascular complications are frequently observed in diabetic patients and are mostly caused by endothelial dysfunction associated with a decline in biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO). In response to this concern, a remarkable increase in the interest for development of NO-releasing hybrid drugs has been observed. The NO-donating entity was linked to known drugs with the belief that NO is a vasorelaxant and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation or reduces thrombotic events. Many of these NO-releasing hybrid drugs have shown significant improvement in cardiovascular safety. In this editorial the potential roles of NO-releasing drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular complications in diabetes will be discussed.
