{"id":84371,"title":"Insulin action on GABA neurons is a critical regulator of energy balance but not fertility in mice.","abstract":"Insulin signaling in the brain plays an important role in the central regulation of energy homeostasis and fertility, such that mice exhibiting brain-specific deletion of insulin receptors (InsRs) display a diet-sensitive obesogenic phenotype and hypothalamic hypogonadism. However, the specific neurons mediating insulin's central effects on fertility remain largely unidentified. The neurotransmitters ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are important modulators of fertility and energy homeostasis and are widely distributed in the hypothalamus. We therefore investigated whether insulin signaling via GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons plays an important role in the metabolic regulation of fertility. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate mice with a selective inactivation of the Insr gene from GABAergic (Vgat(+)) or glutamatergic (Vglut2(+)) cells by crossing Insr-flox mice with Vgat-Cre or Vglut2-Cre mice, respectively. Multiple reproductive and metabolic parameters were then compared between male and female Insr-flox/Vgat-Cre(+) (VgatIRKO), Insr-flox/Vglut2-Cre(+) (VglutIRKO), and Insr-flox/Cre-negative control (CON) mice. Female VgatIRKO mice exhibited a significant increase in adult body weight, abdominal fat mass, and fasting plasma insulin and leptin concentrations, but normal fasting glucose concentration and glucose tolerance compared with CON mice. Surprisingly, VgatIRKO and VglutIRKO mice exhibited normal reproductive maturation and function compared with CONs. No differences in the age of puberty onset, estrous cyclicity, or fertility were observed between VgatIRKO, VglutIRKO, and CON mice. However, male VgatIRKO mice exhibited significantly augmented LH concentration and a trend toward reduced seminal vesicle weight compared with CON mice, which may be indicative of primary hypogonadism. Our results therefore demonstrate that insulin signaling via GABAergic and glutamatergic cells is not required for fertility in mice, but show that GABAergic neurons encompass circuitry through which insulin acts to modulate energy homeostasis.","date":"2014-10-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
