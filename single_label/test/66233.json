{"id":66233,"title":"Pharmacodynamics assessment of Bemiparin after multiple prophylactic and single therapeutic doses in adult and elderly healthy volunteers and in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment.","abstract":"Aging and renal impairment may prolong the half-life and lead to accumulation of low molecular weight heparins. Correct dosing is critical to prevent bleeding or thrombosis.Open, parallel study. Healthy adult [n=13] and elderly (>65yrs) [n=12] volunteers; and subjects with mild (ClCr?50 to ?80mL/min, n=8), moderate (ClCr?30 to <50mL/min, n=7), and severe (ClCr<30mL/min, n=8) renal impairment received four prophylactic doses (3,500IU/24h) and a single therapeutic dose (115IU/kg) of bemiparin with an interim washout period. Anti-FXa activity and the potential need for dose adjustment were evaluated.There were statistically significant differences in the severe renal impairment group vs. adult volunteers in all anti-FXa related parameters, but no significant differences in any of the anti-FXa related parameters between the adult and the elderly. Anti-FXa simulations after 10 prophylactic doses predicted mean Amax=0.59IU/mL in subjects with severe renal impairment and 0.33-0.39IU/mL in the rest. Simulations in the severe renal impairment group with dose adjustment (2,500IU/24h) predicted all individual Amax<0.60IU/mL (mean Amax=0.42IU/ml). Simulations after 10 therapeutic doses predicted mean Amax=1.22IU/mL in severe renal impairment group and 0.89-0.98IU/mL in the rest. Simulations in the severe renal impairment group with 75% dose adjustment predicted individual Amax?1.60IU/mL (mean Amax=0.91IU/mL).No dose adjustments are required in elderly with preserved renal function. A dose adjustment of bemiparin is only advisable in patients with severe renal impairment when using prophylactic or therapeutic doses.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731560","annotations":[{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.772608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.633002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.611839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.474575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.392145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.356032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.323041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.29216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Low molecular weight heparin","weight":0.020329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_molecular_weight_heparin"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/890"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Run-in period","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-in_period"},{"name":"Washout (aviation)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washout_(aviation)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
