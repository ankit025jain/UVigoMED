{"id":76681,"title":"Influence of CYP1A1*2C on high triglyceride levels in female Mexican indigenous Tarahumaras.","abstract":"High triglyceride levels are closely related to cardiovascular disease. Its development lays on age, diet, physical activity, ethnicity and genetic factors. Among the last, the CYP1A1*2C allele has an influence on the metabolism of cholesterol and other fatty acids. We undertook this study to determine the frequency of CYP1A1*2C and its association with triglyceride levels in Mexican indigenous Tarahumaras and Tepehuanos.Anthropometric and biochemical data were recorded. Genotyping of CYP1A1*2C by RT-PCR was done in 110 Tepehuano, 69 Tarahumara and 64 Mestizo.Significant differences in age, waist diameter, BMI, creatinine, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and VLDL measurements were found between Tarahumaras and Tepehuanos (p <0.05). Additionally, Tarahumara women showed the highest values of waist diameter, BMI and triglycerides (p <0.05). It was found that Tarahumaras showed a significant association between high triglyceride levels and CYP1A1*2C allele (OR = 2.57; 95% CI 1.12-5.88, p = 0.024) under a recessive inheritance model. However, the Tepehuano group showed a significant protective association between normal triglyceride levels and CYP1A1*2C polymorphism (OR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.10-0.80, p = 0.015) following a dominant inheritance model. The same pattern was observed after analysis with females of both ethnicities.A significant association between CYP1A1*2C and high triglyceride levels in Amerindian Tarahumaras from Chihuahua has been found; this allele was significantly associated with normal triglyceride levels in Tepehuanos from Durango, Mexico. Further studies are needed to elucidate the genetic role of CYP1A1 in cardiovascular disease susceptibility.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
