{"id":12906,"title":"Computer-aided codon-pairs deoptimization of the major envelope GP5 gene attenuates porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.","abstract":"Synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) is an emerging technology that enables rapid attenuation of viruses. In this study, by using SAVE we demonstrated rapid attenuation of an arterivirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The major envelope GP5 gene of PRRSV was codon-pair deoptimized aided by a computer algorithm. The codon-pair deoptimized virus, designated as SAVE5 with a deoptimized GP5 gene, was successfully rescued in vitro. The SAVE5 virus replicated at a lower level in vitro with a significant decrease of GP5 protein expression compared to the wild-type PRRSV VR2385 virus. Pigs experimentally infected with the SAVE5 virus had significantly lower viremia level up to 14 days post-infection as well as significantly reduced gross and histological lung lesions when compared to wild-type PRRSV VR2385 virus-infected pigs, indicating the attenuation of the SAVE5 virus. This study proved the feasibility of rapidly attenuating PRRSV by SAVE.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503075","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.815461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.722387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.71212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.708807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.680419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.561383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.434434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.33271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.238393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Arterivirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterivirus"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0218275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Viral envelope","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Emerging technologies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies"}]}
