{"id":37963,"title":"A novel phenotype associated with cutis laxa, abnormal fat distribution, cardiomyopathy and cataract.","abstract":"Cutis laxa (CL) is a connective tissue disorder, characterized by loose, inelastic, sagging skin. Both acquired and inherited (dominant, recessive, and X-linked) forms exist. Here, we describe a new phenotype, which overlaps with other known CL syndromes. Our patient has a unique combination of features in association with sagging, inelastic, wrinkled skin, including cataract, severe cardiomyopathy, abnormal fat distribution, improvement of skin-wrinkling with age, and white matter abnormalities but no significant histologic collagen or elastin abnormalities. Mutation analysis of known CL genes was negative. We suggest that our patient has a novel syndrome, with the main features of CL, intellectual disability, abnormal fat distribution, cardiomyopathy, and cataract.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459010","annotations":[{"name":"Elastin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Connective tissue disease","weight":0.812875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue_disease"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cutis laxa","weight":0.796676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutis_laxa"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.774293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.661342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.388516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
