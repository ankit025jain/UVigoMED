{"id":81807,"title":"STAG2 loss of expression is rare in aneuploid malignant   salivary gland neoplasms.","abstract":"STAG2 depletion leads to loss of centromere cohesion in vitro, and some human neoplasms have been shown to lose expression of this protein. As a result, STAG2 loss has been shown to cause chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in human cancer cell lines.We tested the hypothesis that aneuploid salivary gland tumours lose immunoexpression of STAG2 compared with diploid tumours using image cytometry to determine DNA ploidy and immunohistochemistry to assess STAG2 protein expression in 30 malignant salivary gland neoplasms.There was no difference in the immunoexpression of STAG2 between aneuploid (n = 9) and diploid (n = 21) samples. In all but two samples, more than 50% of cells stained for STAG2.Aneuploidy in human salivary gland carcinomas is not driven by loss of expression of STAG2.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822266","annotations":[{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.857825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Ploidy","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.516807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Salivary gland neoplasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland_neoplasm"},{"name":"Cohesin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesin"}]}
