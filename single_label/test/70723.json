{"id":70723,"title":"Axillopexy.","abstract":"The present paper is a presentation of our technique of axillopexy, used after the excision of the axillary lymph nodes in 29 cases of breast cancer patients. We have used this technique after Madden modified radical mastectomy or after quadrantectomy for tumors in the external quadrants of the mammary gland. We have studied and compared with a 30 case control group, the duration of the lymphorrhagia the moment of removing the drains, the presence absence of other local complications. We have also measured the time until the beginning of the oncological postoperative therapy. Every one of the aspects we have studied was improved in the axillopexy group.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149619","annotations":[{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Radical mastectomy","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_mastectomy"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.825421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.796806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.572247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.365295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.247521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"}]}
