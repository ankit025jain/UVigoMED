{"id":87631,"title":"[System analysis of metabolic profile of blood in patients with thermal trauma].","abstract":"To make multiparametric analysis of blood metabolic profile in early period of burn disease.We tested blood samples of 15 healthy adults (control group) and 60 patients with thermal trauma (main group--II-4IIIA, B degree of burn, more then 15 bsp). Parameters of lipid metabolism, level of glucose, lactate, malonic dialdehyde and some enzymes in blood plasma and erythrocytes were estimated.In early period of burn disease we fixed the clear metabolic disorders, including tissues hypoxia, activation of plasma transaminases and oxidoreductases, inhibition of detoxication system, induction of oxidative stress. Connection of metabolic changes, associated with burn disease, was registered. It supported by numerous correlations between studied parameters, formed from first day after trauma.Our data expand the knowledge about mating metabolic changes of catalytic activity of blood enzymes, forming in early period of burn disease (system metabolic disadaptation), and diagnostic value of some blood biochemical parameters in estimation of burned patient metabolism.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055556","annotations":[{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Aldehyde","weight":0.760474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.530091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.412785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.386963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.30011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mating","weight":0.277041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.247072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.201595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Oxidoreductase","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidoreductase"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Malonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malonic_acid"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
