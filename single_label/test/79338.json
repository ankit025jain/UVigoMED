{"id":79338,"title":"Endoscopic resection of sinonasal cancers.","abstract":"Sinonasal malignancies, a rare group of tumors, are characterized by histological heterogeneity and poor survival. As improvements in image-guidance and endoscopic technologies became incorporated into head and neck oncologic and neurosurgical practice, the application of these technologies and techniques to the surgical management of sinonasal malignancy began. Over the past decade, there has been increasing evidence regarding the safety and oncological effectiveness of these techniques. Several institutions have reported their experience with endoscopic surgery and have shown reduced morbidity, better quality of life, and survival outcomes equivalent to those of open surgery in carefully selected patients. Endoscopic cranial base surgery is a rapidly evolving field. We review the literature on oncological outcomes, safety, quality of life, and recent technological advances.
