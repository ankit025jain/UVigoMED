{"id":87894,"title":"Patient and disease characteristics associated with hip arthroscopy failure in acetabular dysplasia.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to define the clinical and disease characteristics in patients who fail hip arthroscopy and require periacetabular osteotomy. Thirty patients (30 hips) who underwent a PAO, following a failed hip arthroscopy were identified from a multicenter database. Eighty-seven percent were female and the average age was 27.3 years. The average LCE angle was 14.7°, acetabular inclination 16.3°, and ACE angle 16.8°. Labral abnormalities and acetabular chondral disease were noted at PAO surgery in 60 and 56%, respectively. The average clinical scores prior to the PAO were mHHS 53.5, WOMAC 56.9, and UCLA 5.4. Failed hip arthroscopy and the need for PAO are most commonly observed in young female patients with mild to moderate dysplasia, major functional limitations and associated intra-articular abnormalities.
