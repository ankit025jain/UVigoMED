{"id":56256,"title":"Treat-and-extend intravitreal bevacizumab for branch retinal vein occlusion.","abstract":"To determine the effectiveness and direct medical costs of treat-and-extend (TAE) intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) for the treatment of branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)-associated macular edema (ME).Retrospective chart review of 52 consecutive patients diagnosed with BRVO-associated ME treated with IVB using a TAE protocol.Mean change in logMAR vision was -0.30 (P < .001), and mean change in central macular thickness was -244.0 ?m (P < .001). The mean number of injections was 8.2 (95% CI; 7.8 to 8.6). The yearly average direct cost of the TAE regimen was calculated to be $2,580.26 per patient.Treatment of BRVO-associated ME with IVB using a TAE regimen resulted in similar visual outcomes and number of intravitreal injections as did as-needed treatment with 0.5 mg ranibizumab conducted in phase 3 trials but with fewer visits and lower annual medical costs.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716783","annotations":[{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.686466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.320694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.235411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.113797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"244","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/244"},{"name":"580","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/580"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Variable cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_cost"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"In phase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_phase"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Health care prices","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices"},{"name":"Chronic fatigue syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome"}]}
