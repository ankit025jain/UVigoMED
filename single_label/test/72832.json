{"id":72832,"title":"Effectiveness of integrated multidisciplinary rehabilitation in primary brain cancer survivors in an Australian community cohort: a controlled clinical trial.","abstract":"To evaluate effectiveness of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for persons following definitive primary brain tumour treatment in a community cohort.The brain tumour (glioma) survivors (n?=?106) were allocated either to the treatment group (n?=?53) (intensive ambulatory multidisciplinary rehabilitation), or the waitlist control group (n?=?53). The primary outcome - Functional Independence Measure (FIM), measured 'Activity' limitation; secondary measures included Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale, Perceived Impact Problem Profile and Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System. Assessments were at baseline, 3 and 6 months after program completion.Participants were predominantly women (56%), with mean age 51 years (standard deviation 13.6) and median time since diagnosis of 2.1 years. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant difference between groups at 3-month in favour of multidisciplinary rehabilitation program in FIM motor subscales: 'self-care', 'sphincter', 'locomotion', 'mobility'(p?<?0.01 for all); and FIM 'communication' (p?<?0.01) and 'psychosocial' subscales (p?<?0.05), with small to moderate effect size (r?=?0.2-0.4). At 6-month follow-up, significant improvement in the treatment group was maintained only for FIM 'sphincter', 'communication' and 'cognition' subscales (p?<?0.01 for all). No difference between groups was noted in other subscales.brain tumour survivors can improve function with multidisciplinary rehabilitation, with some gains maintained up to 6 months. Evidence for specific interventions in the 'blackbox' of rehabilitation is needed.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24940656","annotations":[{"name":"Stress
