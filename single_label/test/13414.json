{"id":13414,"title":"Antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of flavonoids PMT1 and PMT2 isolated from Piper montealegreanum Yuncker (Piperaceae) in mice.","abstract":"In this study, we identified the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of two flavonoids (PMT1 and PMT2) from Piper montealegreanum. The antinociceptive effect was evaluated using the classical tests: acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin and hot plate test. PMT1 and PMT2 (0.1, 1, 30 and 100 ?mol/kg, i.p.) reduced the writhings, with an ID50 of 0.58 and 0.44 ?mol/kg, respectively. Moreover, these flavonoids (100 ?mol/kg, i.p.) inhibited paw-licking time in the neurogenic phase of the formalin test, but only PMT2 was active in the inflammatory phase. However, PMT1 and PMT2 (100 ?mol/kg, i.p.) did not increase the latency time of the animals in the hot plate. In order to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of these flavonoids, capsaicin-induced ear oedema was carried out. Both flavonoids (100 ?mol/kg, i.p.) were active in this model. These results suggest that PMT1 and PMT2 have antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479832","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.68236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.581872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.325499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.189585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.134477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Piperaceae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperaceae"},{"name":"Hot plate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_plate"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Premenstrual syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_syndrome"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Truman G.
