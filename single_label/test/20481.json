{"id":20481,"title":"Factors influencing posaconazole plasmatic concentrations in patients presenting with acute myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"The effectiveness of posaconazole (PSZ) prophylaxis on invasive fungal infections, in patients presenting with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), seems to be correlated to its blood plasma concentration. Our goal was to identify the risk factors for underdosing.We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated for AML treated with PSZ, during a 2-year period. Assays<500ng/mL were considered as under dosed.Fifty-nine assays (43 patients) were performed during induction (n=22) or consolidation (n=37) chemotherapy. PSZ treatment was initiated within a median of 3 days before neutropenia with a first assay performed at 8 days (3-28). The median PSZ blood plasma concentration was 375ng/mL (<200-1900). Forty-one (69%) treatment were maintained until the end of neutropenia. One patient presented with candidemia, 9 with possible invasive aspergillosis, without any significant association with underdosing. The univariate analysis showed that co-administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (P=0.01) and cause of hospitalization (induction chemotherapy vs consolidation, P=0.008) were associated with underdosing, contrary to feeding difficulties (P=0.07) and digestive disorders (P=0.5). The multivariate analysis confirmed the impact of PPI use (P=0.01) and the cause of hospitalization (P=0.003).This study highlights the major impact of PPI administration on PSZ blood plasma levels and stresses the risk of non-effective prophylaxis during induction treatment of AML.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656841","annotations":[{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.837309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Aspergillosis","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillosis"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.793984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.779108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.772433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.666454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.519897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.484947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.428812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.377966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.267374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"}]}
