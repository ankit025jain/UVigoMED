{"id":46306,"title":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells microRNA predicts treatment outcome of hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection.","abstract":"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been associated with induction of microRNAs (miRNAs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We aimed to evaluate the role of PBMC-miRNAs in the treatment outcome to antiviral therapy for HCV genotype 1 (HCV-1) patients.Treatment-naive chronic HCV-1 patients, including 13 in screening phase and 48 in validation phase, were treated with 48weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin. The primary end-point was the achievement of a sustained virological response (SVR, HCV RNA undetectable during 24weeks post-treatment follow-up). Expression profiling of PBMC-miRNAs was performed by quantitative PCR-based array in typical responders and null-responders. Then candidate PBMC-miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR in an independent validation set.PBMC-miR-125b was significantly predictive of an SVR, with expression levels of 5.28-fold lower in sustained responders versus null-responders (p=0.0163). In multivariate analysis, PBMC-miR-125b was significantly associated with the achievement of SVR (per 2-fold decrease, odds ratio/95% confidence interval (OR/CI): 2.07/1.14-6.31) independent of sex, age and interleukin-28B genotype. In patients who did not achieve a rapid virological response (RVR, undetectable HCV RNA at treatment week 4), PBMC-miR-125b was the only predictive factor of an SVR (per 2-fold decrease, OR/CI: 2.07/1.14-6.31). However, the circulating and hepatic miR-125b did not show significant difference between responders and non-responders.PBMC-miR-125b expression levels were inversely related to the achievement of an SVR in HCV-1 patients, independent of interleukin-28B genotype, and was the single predictor of SVR in non-RVR patients.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637254","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.918735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.725719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.723632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.689441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.552595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.510767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.438483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.425366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.215183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0677557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
