{"id":77706,"title":"Racism and cardiovascular disease: implications for nursing.","abstract":"The social determinants of health (SDH) are recognized as a prominent influence on health outcomes across the lifespan. Racism is identified as a key SDH. In this article, the authors describe the concept of racism as an SDH, its impact in discriminatory actions and inactions, and the implications for cardiovascular nurses. Although research in Canada on the links among racism, stress, and cardiovascular disease is limited, there is growing evidence about the stress of racism and its long-term impact on cardiovascular health. The authors discuss how cardiovascular nursing could be enhanced through an understanding of racism-related stress, and race-based differences in cardiovascular care. The authors conclude with strategies for action to address this nursing concern.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400461","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Social determinants of health","weight":0.831555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.742176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Racism","weight":0.699676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.461002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.436874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.30069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Action theory (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_theory_(philosophy)"}]}
