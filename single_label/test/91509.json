{"id":91509,"title":"Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging signal changes in vertebral depressed fractures to determine the fracture time.","abstract":"This research is based on studying MRI signal changes in depressive vertebra fractures in order to determine the time of damages. With this information, difficulty for both clinicians and insurance companies will be resolved. In this descriptive analytical study, the MRI of the patients with vertebral collapse was evaluated. In all cases, during the twelve month study, all fractured vertebras had complete isodense sequences in T1-W and T2-W. This study confirms that any fractured vertebra in contrast with its adjacent normal vertebra has a specific amount of signal change in determined time passing.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498795","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.704701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.582316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.55762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.476491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.388867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.224274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
