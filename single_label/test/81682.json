{"id":81682,"title":"Workplace cluster of Bell's palsy in Lima, Peru.","abstract":"We report on a workplace cluster of Bell's palsy that occurred within a four-month period in 2011 among employees of a three-story office building in Lima, Peru and our investigation to determine the etiology and associated risk factors.An outbreak investigation was conducted to identify possible common infectious or environmental exposures and included patient interviews, reviews of medical records, an epidemiologic survey, serological analysis for IgM and IgG antibodies to putative Bell's palsy-inducing pathogens, and an environmental exposure assessment of the office building. Three cases of Bell's palsy were reported among 65 at-risk employees, attack rate 4.6%. Although two patients had underlying risk factors, there was no clear association or common identifiable risk factor among all cases. Serologic analysis showed no evidence of recent infections, and air and water sample measures of all known chemical or neurotoxins were below maximum allowable concentrations for exposure.An infection spread among workplace employees could not be excluded as a potential cause of this cluster; however, it was unlikely a pathogen commonly associated with individual cases of Bell's palsy. Although a specific etiology was not identified among all cases, we believe this methodology will aid future outbreak investigations of Bell's palsy and a better understanding of its etiology. While environmental assessments may be useful in their ability to ascertain the cause of clusters of Bell's palsy, future investigations should prioritize focus on common infectious etiology.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885256","annotations":[{"name":"Serology","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.646359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.544178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Peru","weight":0.515992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.341667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neurotoxin","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxin"},{"name":"Exposure assessment","weight":0.270936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_assessment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.255994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Lima","weight":0.212232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Water quality","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Inflorescence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Attack rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_rate"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Environmental impact assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment"}]}
