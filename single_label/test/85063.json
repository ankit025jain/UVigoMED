{"id":85063,"title":"Ultrashort-segment tracheal stenosis at juxtacarinal location: is it congenital absence of just the single cartilage or part of a spectrum of anomalous growth?","abstract":"Isolated absence of cartilage rings in the absence of a tracheoesophageal fistula is extremely rare and usually seen in the upper third of the trachea. A juxtacarinal segment is unique embryologically, with the distal tracheal cartilage being trifold in shape. Absence of this cartilage is rare and possibly implies specific developmental changes in airway. We report 3 such patients treated by excision of the affected segment and a direct anastomosis, with good result.
