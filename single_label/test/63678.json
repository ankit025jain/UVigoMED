{"id":63678,"title":"Immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptors for multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic transmembrane proteins that are used to redirect autologous T cells with a new specificity for antigens on the surface of cancer cells. Impressive results from early phase clinical trials of anti-CD19 CARs for B cell malignancies have generated great enthusiasm for developing this approach for other diseases, particularly hematologic malignancies. Here we review efforts to develop CARs for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical trials are underway investigating CARs against Kappa light chain, CD138, and Lewis Y antigen. CARs against BCMA, CS1, and CD38 are in pre-clinical testing. While initial clinical trials of novel CARs will focus on relapsed/refractory disease, CARs will also likely be studied as a consolidation strategy after response to first-line therapy or in conjunction with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
