{"id":81743,"title":"Imaging findings of necrotizing sialometaplasia of the parotid gland: case report and literature review.","abstract":"Although necrotizing sialometaplasia (NS) of the parotid gland is rare and occasionally presents as a lesion that mimics a malignant tumour, imaging findings in cases of NS have been rarely reported. We describe here a case of NS in which there was an increasing lesion manifesting overnight on the parotid gland in an 83-year-old male. We also investigated the use of pre-operative imaging based on previous reports and discuss the importance of these images in helping to guard against overzealous treatment. It is critically important to closely examine whether there are aspects of NS, such as the present case, in pre-operative MRI findings that can be useful in proper diagnosis and treatment.
