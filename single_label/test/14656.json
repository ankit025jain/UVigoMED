{"id":14656,"title":"Efficacy of marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf against challenge with classical swine fever virus isolates of different genotypes.","abstract":"Classical swine fever (CSF) is among the most important viral disease of domestic and feral pigs and has a serious impact on animal health and pig industry. In most countries with industrialized pig production, prophylactic vaccination against CSF is banned, and all efforts are directed towards eradication of the disease, e.g. by culling of infected herds and animal movement restrictions. Nevertheless, emergency vaccination remains an option to minimize the socio-economic impact of outbreaks. For this application, potent vaccines are needed that allow differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals. Among the promising candidates for next generation marker vaccines is the chimeric pestivirus CP7_E2alf. Efficacy studies are usually carried out using highly virulent CSFV strains of genotype 1 that do not mirror the current field situation where strains of genotype 2 predominate. To prove that CP7_E2alf also protects against these strains, efficacy was assessed after single oral vaccination of wild boar and single intramuscular vaccination of domestic pigs using challenge models with recent CSFV strains and the highly virulent strain \"Koslov\" (genotype 1.1). It could be demonstrated that CP7_E2alf pilot vaccine batches for intramuscular and oral use were able to protect pigs from challenge infection with a highly virulent CSFV. Moreover, solid protection was also achieved in case of challenge infection with recent field strains of genotypes 2.1 and 2.3. Thus, broad applicability under field conditions can be assumed.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Animal
