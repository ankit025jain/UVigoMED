{"id":41490,"title":"Evidence for immune activation in patients with residual hepatitis C virus RNA long after successful treatment with IFN and ribavirin.","abstract":"Low-level hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA may persist in PBMCs after successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C, but the consequences of this phenomenon are unclear. Forty-nine patients who achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) after pegylated IFN and ribavirin therapy were analysed 52-66 months after the SVR. HCV RNA was detected in PBMCs from 18 patients (47.4?%), and PBMCs in two patients stained positive for non-structural protein 3 (NS3). Quantification of various cytokine and chemokine transcripts in PBMCs revealed that levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-? and macrophage inflammatory protein 1? were significantly higher in HCV-positive patients than in HCV-negative individuals. In conclusion, persistence of HCV RNA in PBMCs of patients with a SVR appears to be associated with immune activation.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920726","annotations":[{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.798363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.758458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.551825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.48136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Macrophage inflammatory protein","weight":0.449028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_inflammatory_protein"},{"name":"Viral nonstructural protein","weight":0.210889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_nonstructural_protein"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"}]}
