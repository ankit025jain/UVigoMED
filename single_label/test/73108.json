{"id":73108,"title":"Developmental pathways hijacked by osteosarcoma.","abstract":"Cancer of any type often can be described by an arrest, alteration or disruption in the normal development of a tissue or organ, and understanding of the normal counterpart's development can aid in understanding the malignant state. This is certainly true for osteosarcoma and the normal developmental pathways that guide osteoblast development that are changed in the genesis of osteogenic sarcoma. A carefully regulated crescendo-decrescendo expression of RUNX2 accompanies the transition from mesenchymal stem cell to immature osteoblast to mature osteoblast. This pivotal role is controlled by several pathways, including bone morphogenic protein (BMP), Wnt/?-catenin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and protein kinase C (PKC). The HIPPO pathway and its downstream target YAP help to regulate proliferation of immature osteoblasts and their maturation into non-proliferating mature osteoblasts. This pathway also helps regulate expression of the mature osteoblast protein osteocalcin. YAP also regulates expression of MT1-MMP, a membrane-bound matrix metalloprotease responsible for remodeling the extracellular matrix surrounding the osteoblasts. YAP, in turn, can be regulated by the ERBB family protein Her-4. Osteosarcoma may be thought of as a cell held at the immature osteoblast stage, retaining some of the characteristics of that developmental stage. Disruptions of several of these pathways have been described in osteosarcoma, including BMP, Wnt/b-catenin, RUNX2, HIPPO/YAP, and Her-4. Further, PKC can be activated by several receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in osteosarcoma, including the ERBB family (EGFR, Her-2 and Her-4 in osteosarcoma), IGF1R, FGF, and others. Understanding these functions may aid in the understanding the mechanisms underpinning clinical observations in osteosarcoma, including both the lytic and blastic phenotypes of tumors, the invasiveness of the disease, and the tendency for treated tumors to ossify rather than shrink. Through a better understanding of the relationship between normal osteoblast development and osteosarcoma, we may gain insights into novel therapeutic avenues and improved outcomes.
