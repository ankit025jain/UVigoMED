{"id":68579,"title":"B25716/1: a novel albumin-binding Gd-AAZTA MRI contrast agent with improved properties in tumor imaging.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to describe the synthesis of, relaxometric characterization of, pharmacokinetic properties of, and animal imaging experiments with a new, low molecular weight gadolinium complex with high binding affinity toward serum albumin. The gadolinium(III) chelate (B25716/1) is based on the structure of the heptadentate ligand 1,4-bis(hydroxycarbonylmethyl)-6-[bis(hydroxycarbonylmethyl)]amino-6 methylperhydro-1,4-diazepine (AAZTA) covalently conjugated to an analogue of deoxycholic acid. The study was conducted as a comparison with that of an analogous complex based on the octadentate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ligand B22956/1 (whose albumin binding properties were previously assessed). The structural modification with respect to B22956/1 leads to a system that can host two coordinated water molecules in fast exchange with bulk water with potential higher efficiency as an MRI contrast agent. On interaction with human serum albumin the expected-field-independent-relaxation enhancement is not observed, possibly as a consequence of the displacement of one of the two inner-sphere water molecules of the gadolinium complex. At clinically relevant magnetic fields, however, the plasma relaxivity of B25716/1 is markedly higher than that shown by B22956/1, owing to concomitant synergistic contributions from the electronic correlation time and water molecules in the second coordination sphere. The capability of B25716/1 to enhance tumor regions in magnetic resonance images was assessed in vivo at 3Â T on a xenograft tumor mouse model prepared with PC-3 cells. B25716/1 displays signal enhancements approximately double those observed for B22956/1, in agreement with the findings of the in vitro relaxivity investigations.
