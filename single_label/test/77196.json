{"id":77196,"title":"Sarcopenia and the analysis of body composition.","abstract":"Reduction of lean mass is a primary body composition change associated with aging. Because many factors contribute to lean mass reduction, the problem has been given various names depending on the proposed cause, such as \"age-related sarcopenia,\" \"dynapenia,\" \"myopenia,\" \"sarcopenic obesity,\" or simply \"sarcopenia.\" There is currently no consensus on how to best diagnose the reduction of lean mass and its consequences on health. We propose that simple body composition methods can be used to indirectly evaluate sarcopenia, provided that those techniques are validated against the \"quality of lean\" criterion that associates muscle mass and metabolic function with the components of fat-free mass. Promising field methods include the use of stable isotopes for the evaluation of water compartments and new approaches to bioelectrical impedance analysis, which is also associated with the monitoring of water homeostasis.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829472","annotations":[{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.799009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.616243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.494868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.481567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.185993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Sarcopenia","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia"},{"name":"Bioelectromagnetism","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectromagnetism"},{"name":"Osmoregulation","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmoregulation"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Bioelectrical impedance analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Field work","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_work"},{"name":"Central body","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_body"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
