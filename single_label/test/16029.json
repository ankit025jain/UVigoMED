{"id":16029,"title":"[Review of WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy 8th report, --comparison to 7th report].","abstract":"In 2012 the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy published its 8th report, 14 years after the publication of its 7th report in 1998. This report, the first since the leprosy reduction goal was met in 2000, highlights key points such as improvements in the quality of various services available to patients and the efforts of individuals and societies, in addition to medical progress in diagnosis and treatment. This review will mainly describe the changes made since the 7th report. Some of the main modifications are the deletion of single lesion paucibacillary type, elongated treatment of patients with high bacterial indices, the introduction of promising new drugs, and a shift from reducing the statistical number of patients to a new target for disability prevention.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076761","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.622531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.614257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.556855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.43624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.414337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.297123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.192765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.13498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"September 8","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_8"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"}]}
