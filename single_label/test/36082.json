{"id":36082,"title":"The fetal safety of Levetiracetam: a systematic review.","abstract":"To systematically review the available published evidence on the fetal safety of Levetiracetam with focus on birth defects.Eight studies met the inclusion criteria; five pregnancy registries and one population based cohort study. A total of 27 major congenital malformations were reported among 1213 Levetiracetam monotherapy - exposed pregnant women, yielding an overall major malformation rate of 2.2% (27/1213) [95% confidence interval of 1.53-3.22]. In contrast, Levetiracetam polytherapy was associated with significantly higher malformation rate of 6.3% (34/541) [95% CI of 4.53-8.65] (P<0.001). Additionally 2 studies investigating child neurodevelopment in Levetiracetam - exposed children revealed that the measured achievements were well above those children exposed to valproic acid, and similar to unexposed controls.The current evidence suggests that the overall risk of major malformation after first trimester exposure to Levetiracetam is within the population baseline risk of 1-3%, with no apparent adverse effects on long term child development.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602560","annotations":[{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Valproic acid","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproic_acid"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.560106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.284512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.247526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.242562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Levetiracetam","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levetiracetam"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"538","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/538"},{"name":"1213","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1213"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Inclusion (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_(education)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
