{"id":23352,"title":"[Early treatment of postoperative pyogenic infection in patients with lumbar disc diseases].","abstract":"To explore the etiopathogenisis, diagnosis and early treatment of postoperative pyogenic infection in patients with lumbar disc diseases.From March 2009 to March 2012,7 patients with postoperative pyogenic infection were retrospectivly analyzed. There were 6 males and 1 female,ranging in age from 42 to 62 years old,with an average of 46.5 years old. Among 7 cases,outside the spinal canal suppurative infection occurred in 6 cases and inside the spinal canal infection in 1 case and with temporary paralysis. All the patients were treated with continuous saline lavage-drainage of low pressure impulse during operation. Unitive sensitive antibiotics were applied for 4-6 weeks after operation until CRP and ESR completely normal or the biochemistry and routine examination of the cerebrospinal fluid completely normal for the patients with intracranial pyogenic infection.All the 7 cases obtained recovery and the length of stay was for 2-3 months. No remnant symptoms of nervous system were found at the leave hospital.Postoperative pyogenic infection in patients with lumbar disc diseases is an emergency,and easily results in misdiagnosis in clinic. So the early diagnosis is very important. Early debridement is the only measure to retrieve the life of patient,continuous saline lavage-drainage of low pressure impulse may remove the remnant focus of the deep soft tissue space,and removel of the internal fixation can ensure the postoperative pyogenic infection completely control.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490536","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.753081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.601689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.599888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.5758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.479782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.462581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Spinal canal","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_canal"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.201457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Pyogenic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyogenic"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0251131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
