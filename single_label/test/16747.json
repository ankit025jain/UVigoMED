{"id":16747,"title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase I controls survival from Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection by processing surfactant protein D.","abstract":"Prior work established that a deficiency in the cysteine protease dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI) improves survival following polymicrobial septic peritonitis. To test whether DPPI regulates survival from severe lung infections, DPPI(-/-) mice were studied in a Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection model, finding that survival in DPPI(-/-) mice is significantly better than in DPPI(+/+) mice 8d after infection. DPPI(-/-) mice have significantly fewer bacteria in the lung than infected DPPI(+/+) mice, but no difference in lung histopathology, lung injury, or cytokine levels. To explore mechanisms of enhanced bacterial clearance in DPPI(-/-) mice, we examined the status of pulmonary collectins, finding that levels of surfactant protein D, but not of surfactant protein A, are higher in DPPI(-/-) than in DPPI(+/+) BAL fluid, and that DPPI(-/-) BAL fluid aggregate bacteria more effectively than control BAL fluid. Sequencing of the amino terminus of surfactant protein D revealed two or eight additional amino acids in surfactant protein D isolated from DPPI(-/-) mice, suggesting processing by DPPI. These results establish that DPPI is a major determinant of survival following Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection and suggest that the survival disadvantage in DPPI(+/+) mice is in part due to processing of surfactant protein D by DPPI.
