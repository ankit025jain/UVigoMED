{"id":50527,"title":"Premature ovarian failure in a 17-year-old woman.","abstract":"Premature ovarian failure (POF) in a healthy adolescent is a rare event. It is diagnosed by the presence of amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels before the age of 40.The patient presented with amenorrhoea at 17 years after identifying a change from her regular to irregular and metrorrhagic cycles. No positive medical history was noted regarding smoking, chemotherapy, radiation or autoimmune diseases and the physical examination was normal. Her family history revealed that both her maternal aunt and grandmother were affected by POF, but the karyotype test was normal and the FMR1 screening premutation test was negative. The patient underwent an ovarian biopsy which revealed the absence of functional follicles. She began a replacement therapy with estroprogestogens and she was informed about the most successful means to start a family, including adoption and oocyte donation.POF is a heterogeneous, multifactorial, and poorly understood condition that involves medical concerns, psychological sphere, and sexuality of the affected patients. Management should be directed at symptoms resolution, bone protection, and psychosocial support for women facing this unexpected and devastating diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine
