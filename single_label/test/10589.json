{"id":10589,"title":"Whole genome sequence analysis of the arctic-lineage strain responsible for distemper in Italian wolves and dogs through a fast and robust next generation sequencing protocol.","abstract":"Dynamic surveillance and characterization of canine distemper virus (CDV) circulating strains are essential against possible vaccine breakthroughs events. This study describes the setup of a fast and robust next-generation sequencing (NGS) Ion PGM™ protocol that was used to obtain the complete genome sequence of a CDV isolate (CDV2784/2013). CDV2784/2013 is the prototype of CDV strains responsible for severe clinical distemper in dogs and wolves in Italy during 2013. CDV2784/2013 was isolated on cell culture and total RNA was used for NGS sample preparation. A total of 112.3 Mb of reads were assembled de novo using MIRA version 4.0rc4, which yielded a total number of 403 contigs with 12.1% coverage. The whole genome (15,690 bp) was recovered successfully and compared to those of existing CDV whole genomes. CDV2784/2013 was shown to have 92% nt identity with the Onderstepoort vaccine strain. This study describes for the first time a fast and robust Ion PGM™ platform-based whole genome amplification protocol for non-segmented negative stranded RNA viruses starting from total cell-purified RNA. Additionally, this is the first study reporting the whole genome analysis of an Arctic lineage strain that is known to circulate widely in Europe, Asia and USA.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642239","annotations":[{"name":"Full genome sequencing","weight":0.898868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_genome_sequencing"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.816825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.742406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.665351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.614339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.606901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.596718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.569667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.552247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Gray wolf","weight":0.393264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf"},{"name":"Canine distemper","weight":0.347512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper"},{"name":"Genome project","weight":0.306932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_project"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Arctic","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Eurasian Wolf","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Wolf"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Megabase","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabase"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"National Geographic Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"}]}
