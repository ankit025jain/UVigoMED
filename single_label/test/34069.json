{"id":34069,"title":"Development of motor planning for dexterity tasks in trisomy 21.","abstract":"We examined the macroscopic aspects of motor planning in two manual dexterity tasks, comparing children, adolescents, and young adults with trisomy 21 (T21) with typically developing controls from a developmental perspective. We analyzed the order in which objects were picked up from a table during two manual tasks of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). Participants with T21 were always slower than controls. Task completion times depended on the strategy used by participants to gather up the pegs or coins. A structured strategy, in which the participants picked the items up moving methodically along each row/column, contributed to rapid task completion by younger children and participants with T21. This study highlights the ability of children with T21 to select and maintain an efficient strategy that takes account of their motor difficulties. Developmental trajectories help to explain T21 functioning in these dexterity tasks.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769429","annotations":[{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.11378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Trisomy 21","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_21"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Fine motor skill","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill"},{"name":"Coin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Furniture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture"},{"name":"Neurotypical","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical"},{"name":"Motor control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control"},{"name":"Tuning peg","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuning_peg"},{"name":"Slingsby T.21","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingsby_T.21"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
