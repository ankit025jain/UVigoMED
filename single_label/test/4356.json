{"id":4356,"title":"[Schistosomiasis status of staff in Hydrology Bureau of Yangtze Water Resources Committee in 2013].","abstract":"To understand the status of schistosomiasis of staff in the Hydrology Bureau of Yangtze Water Resources Committee and the Oncomelania hupensis snail condition of their work areas in 2013, so as to provide the evidences for the schistosomiasis control in the industry.The physical examination data about schistosomiasis of the staff from 2006 to 2013 were collected and analyzed to understand the schistosomiasis prevalence condition of the staff and the changes of their liver parenchyma. Meanwhile, the snail status in the work areas was surveyed.There were 1,393 staff involved in the physical examinations of schistosomiasis in 2003, 197 of them were schistosomiasis patients, the prevalence rate was 14.14%, and no new acute schistosomiasis case occurred. The cases whose liver parenchyma were classified as Grade 0, I , II , III occupied 28.9%, 67.0%, 3.05% and 1.02%, respectively. A total of 24 work areas were involved in the snail survey, and 71 snails were captured. Among the whole snails captured, 39 were living snails, but no schistosome infected snails were found.The prevalence rate of schistosomiasis in staff of the Hydrology Bureau of Yangtze Water Resources Committee is relatively high, so the schistosomiasis surveillance as well as the snail survey and control still should be carried out consistently.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434153","annotations":[{"name":"Water","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.510974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.475271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.389099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Yangtze River","weight":0.1352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.112841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Hydrology","weight":0.0672615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"393","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/393"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"United States House Committee on Natural Resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Natural_Resources"},{"name":"Education in South Africa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_South_Africa"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Water resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
