{"id":50970,"title":"[Metabolic therapy with Actovegin in case of ischemic syndrome of limbs].","abstract":"Actovegin was used in complex conservative and surgical treatment of lower limb chronic ischemia and diabetic foot syndrome in 200 patients. In 120 patients Actovegin was used in combination with reconstructive operations, angioplasty and stenting for preparation for surgery. In 80 patients Actovegin was used as independent method of treatment. In severe cases the medicine was injected intravenously 1000-2000 mg ?10-15, and in mild degrees (IIA-IIB) - 400-800 mg intramuscularly with conversion on the tablet form in the future. Clinical picture, dopplerographic and microcirculatory data evidence about absolute safety, efficiency and comparative cheapness of the parenteral and enteral forms of Actovegine.
