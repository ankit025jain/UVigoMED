{"id":74486,"title":"The social context of occupations: analysis of a father feeding his daughter diagnosed with cerebral palsy.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to examine a father feeding his daughter who is diagnosed with cerebral palsy in order to identify the contexts that make this occupation significant. The analysis of direct observation and interviews demonstrates significant moments where two individuals make intersubjective connections. Themes that are presented are the Intensity of Mealtime, Connections Between Participants, and Adapted Forms of Communication. Both the difficulties and rewards of mealtime are illustrated within these themes. This analysis reveals the structure and importance of doing together in influencing and determining occupations. From a clinical perspective, the meaningfulness of fathering occupations highlights the importance of including fathers in family-centered care.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25347757","annotations":[{"name":"Observation","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.35516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.319056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Intersubjectivity","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cerebral palsy","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Moment (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Connections (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Theory of Forms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"}]}
