{"id":86392,"title":"[Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with chronic heart failure: only a diagnostic marker or also a cardiovascular risk factor?].","abstract":"Sleep disordered breathing with predominant obstructive or central apnea is an under-recognized but highly prevalent comorbidity in patients with chronic heart failure. As the severity of heart failure increases the prevalence of central sleep apnea (CSA) and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is also much more frequent. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is characterized by alternating periods of crescendo and decrescendo respiration followed by central apnea. Present data indicate that CSA-CSR is not only a compensatory response to severe heart failure but also a predictor of worse prognosis. However the results on long-term mortality are not consistent. The prognostic importance of night- and daytime CSR has to be further elucidated. Increased sympathetic nervous activity has been proposed to play a mayor role concerning progression and outcome of chronic heart failure by CSA-CSR.
