{"id":14769,"title":"Molecular typing of Iranian field isolates Mycoplasma synoviae and their differentiation from the live commercial vaccine strain MS-H using vlhA gene.","abstract":"1. The single-copy domain of the N-terminal region of the vlhA gene of Mycoplasma synoviae was sequenced, analysed and verified and used to type Iranian field isolates of M. synoviae and the MS-H live vaccine strain. In addition, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was developed to differentiate between field isolates of Iranian and MS-H vaccine strains. 2. All sequences were analysed and aligned; the percentage similarity of the DNA was calculated and dendrograms were constructed. Based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that existed in all field isolates in Iran, the PCR-RFLP method allowed the differentiation of all M. synoviae field isolates from the vaccine strain. 3. Using phylogenetic analysis, the isolates were assigned to 8 unique genotypes and, within each group, DNA had a high level of similarity. 4. DNA sequence analysis and PCR-RFLP of the amplicon based on percent similarity and evolutionary relationship appeared to be useful tools for strain differentiation whether M. synoviae clinical isolates from infected chickens were derived from the vaccine strain or wild-type strains. 5. This study confirms the potential value of strain typing for epidemiological purposes and suggests that phylogenetic studies are essential to understand the true relationships between strains.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405029","annotations":[{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.805162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.71056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.607118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.583205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.566864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.452892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.443227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.272072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Amplicon","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplicon"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Melanocyte-stimulating hormone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Dendrogram","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"}]}
