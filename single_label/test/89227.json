{"id":89227,"title":"Costs of non-helmeted motorcycle riding in Connecticut.","abstract":"Motorcycle-related head injuries and fatalities are a serious public health concern that can be reduced with helmet use. Caring for crash victims places additional economic stress on the healthcare system. The current Connecticut motorcycle helmet law does not require all motorcyclists to wear helmets. Universal motorcycle helmet laws increase helmet use. Efforts to increase helmet use through education and legislation should be considered for review, given the number of deaths and injuries that could be prevented.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741858","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.631704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.50472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Connecticut","weight":0.469836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Legislation","weight":0.222103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Motorcycle helmet","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_helmet"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Helmet","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet"},{"name":"Equestrianism","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism"},{"name":"Universal Studios","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios"},{"name":"Motorcycling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycling"},{"name":"Motorcycle","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"}]}
