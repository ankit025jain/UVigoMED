{"id":52930,"title":"Metabolism-secretion coupling and mitochondrial calcium activities in clonal pancreatic ?-cells.","abstract":"Pancreatic ?-cells are the only cells capable of lowering blood glucose by secreting insulin. The ?-cell continuously adjusts its secretory activity to substrate availability in order to keep blood glucose levels within the physiological range--a process called metabolism-secretion coupling. Glucose is readily taken up by the ?-cell and broken down into intermediates that fuel oxidative metabolism inside the mitochondria to generate ATP. The resulting increase in the ATP/ADP ratio causes closure of plasma membrane KATP channels, thereby depolarizing the cell and triggering the opening of voltage-gated Ca²? channels. Consequential oscillations of cytosolic Ca²? not only mediate the exocytosis of insulin granules but are also relayed to other subcellular compartments including the mitochondria, where Ca²? is required to accelerate mitochondrial metabolism in response to nutrient stimulation. The mitochondrial Ca²? uptake machinery plays a fundamental role in this feed-forward mechanism that guarantees sustained insulin secretion and, thus, represents a promising therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559914","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Exocytosis","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocytosis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Cellular respiration","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.737157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.709329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Depolarization","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.364585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Fuel","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.341976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Reactive intermediate","weight":0.116864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_intermediate"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Coupling (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(physics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
