{"id":61125,"title":"Acute presentation of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in postmenopausal woman.","abstract":"A healthy 50 years old woman who had no past history of bruising or menometrorrhagia was admitted with complaints of cutaneous petechiae all over the body for 5 days and gum bleeding for 3 days. She presented with isolated thrombocytopenia, an otherwise unremarkable peripheral smear and physical examination showed evidence of bleeding consistent with low platelet count. After excluding other causes of thrombocytopenia, diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was made. She was given intravenous steroids and marked improvement in signs and symptoms was noted.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761502","annotations":[{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Petechia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petechia"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.697689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.0666908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0263793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
