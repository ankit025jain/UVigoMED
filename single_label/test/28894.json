{"id":28894,"title":"DSM-IV alcohol dependence and marital dissolution: evidence from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations among alcohol use disorder (AUD), stressful life events, and marital dissolution in a probability sample of adults.The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions is a prospective, longitudinal study of a probability sample of 43,083 adults 18 years of age and older living in the United States. The interval between Wave 1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2) was approximately 3 years. Cross-sectional analyses included 32,359 adults ages 18 and older who were ever married at W1, and longitudinal analyses included 17,192 adults who were currently married at W1 and who completed relevant W2 measures. Participants completed inhome surveys conducted with computer-assisted personal interviewing.Rates of lifetime marital dissolution were significantly higher among those with lifetime AUD (48.3%) than in those with no lifetime AUD (30.1%). The incidence of marital dissolution from W1 to W2 was 15.5% for those with a past-12-month AUD at W1, compared to 4.8% among those with no AUD. Proportional hazards regression analyses showed that past-12-month AUD, tobacco use disorder, other substance use disorder, stressful life events, older age at marriage, being married more than once, and being married to an alcoholic at W1 predicted greater hazards of marital dissolution at W2. These associations were not moderated by gender.AUD and stressful life events predict subsequent marital dissolution independently of other substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Results were discussed within the framework of the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation model of marriage.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766764","annotations":[{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.78188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Personality disorder","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.227504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0653277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Australian dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Crime statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_statistics"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
