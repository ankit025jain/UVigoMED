{"id":1995,"title":"The appropriateness of a proton pump inhibitor prescription.","abstract":"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most commonly prescribed groups of drug in Ireland, at great expense to the Irish healthcare executive. This study aims to evaluate the appropriateness of PPI prescriptions on admission and discharge in a tertiary referral hospital. All non-elective admissions in the Emergency Department in one week were included in the study. 102 patients in total were included, with 36 (35.4%) treated with a PPI on admission. Of these, only 3 (8.3%) had a clear indication noted as per current NICE guidelines. 18 new in-hospital PPI prescriptions were documented. 11 (61%) of which were present on discharge prescriptions. Continuing PPI prescription on discharge into the community may be inappropriate, costly and potentially harmful. Brief interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate PPI prescriptions have been shown to be effective at reducing the cost and potential harm of unnecessary treatment.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25551900","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.703714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.602278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.500419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.351923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.30029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.234184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.14971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"}]}
