{"id":79363,"title":"ACEMg supplementation ameliorates progressive Connexin 26 hearing loss in a child.","abstract":"Mutations in the gene encoding Connexin 26 are the most common cause of genetic hearing loss. The hearing loss is typically stable but may be progressive. The reason for progression is unknown. Antioxidants have been associated with attenuation of hearing loss from other insults. One antioxidant regimen consists of beta-carotene (metabolized to vitamin A), vitamin C, vitamin E, and magnesium (ACEMg). We present a child with Connexin 26 related hearing loss who experienced progressive hearing loss over 7 years of observation. He was given ACEMg daily for 3 years, during which time his progressive hearing loss was ameliorated.
