{"id":53799,"title":"Incidental parathyroidectomy during thyroid surgery using capsular dissection technique.","abstract":"To identify incidence, preoperative features, surgical factors, and postoperative events of incidental parathyroidectomy (IP) during thyroidectomy.A total of 1068 consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy performed by a single surgeon between January 2003 and April 2012 were enrolled in retrospective study with prospectively collected data.University hospital.To assess the impact of IP on study variables, patients were stratified into 2 study groups: IP group and non-IP group. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified significant correlates of IP.In all, 5.4% patients experienced IP. Significant difference (P < .001) was in incidence of temporary hypocalcemia between IP group (36.2%) and non-IP group (16.8%). Multivariable logistic regression model identified total thyroidectomy (odds ratio 3.937, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.462-10.601, P = .007) and Graves' disease (odds ratio 2.192, 95% CI 1.157-4.158, P = .016) as risk-adjusted factors associated with IP. Multivariate analysis of repeated measures identified statistically significant difference of repeated total calcium level (P < .001) and ionized calcium level (P = .020) between study groups.IP during thyroidectomy might be potential complication. Total thyroidectomy, Graves' disease, longer operation time, and identification 3 and more parathyroid glands seemed to be predictive factors for IP. IP is significantly associated with temporary hypocalcemia, but not with permanent hypoparathyroidism.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496742","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.836759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.773826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.663999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.652698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.424062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.21571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypocalcaemia","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcaemia"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.134208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.0421175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Graves' disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves'_disease"},{"name":"Parathyroidectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroidectomy"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Hypoparathyroidism","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoparathyroidism"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Stratified sampling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"}]}
