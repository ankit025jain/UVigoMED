{"id":91018,"title":"Endovascular treatment of posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm of the internal mammary artery.","abstract":"Pseudoaneurysm of the internal mammary artery is an unusual complication of wounds to the chest. We report a case of a 41-year-old man who sustained a stab chest wound and posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm of the internal mammary artery, resulting in hemomediastinum and hemothorax. The patient was successfully treated using emergency endovascular coil embolization. Because this injury is extremely rare, the literature is reviewed, and several principles are suggested to improve the management.
