{"id":65715,"title":"Investigating the protective role of death receptor 3 (DR3) in renal injury using an organ culture model.","abstract":"Death receptor 3 (DR3; also designated as Wsl-1, Apo3, LARD, TRAMP, TNFRSF25, and TR3) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily that has emerged as a major regulator of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. DR3 contains a homologous intracellular region called the death domain (DD) that can bind adaptor proteins, which also contain a DD, initiating cellular responses such as caspase activation and apoptotic cell death. However, in other circumstances DR3 can initiate induction of transcription genes and gene products that can prevent cell death from occurring. Our laboratory has reported an inducible expression of DR3 in human and mouse tubular epithelial cells in renal injury, but its function in these setting still remains unclear. To directly manipulate and evaluate the role of DR3 in vivo, I have used an in vitro organ culture (OC) model, which I have developed in our laboratory. In this chapter, I will describe in detail the OC model used to study the role of DR3 in renal injury and discuss its advantages and limitations. In my hands, the OC model has proven to be an efficient tool for studying human cell heterogeneity, basal and regulated receptor expression, signalling pathways, and various biological responses not readily achievable in traditional cell culture models. Various assays can be carried out on organ cultures including histology, biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology, which will not be described in detail in this chapter.
