{"id":30629,"title":"Hepatoprotective effect of Ginkgo biloba leaf extract on lantadenes-induced hepatotoxicity in guinea pigs.","abstract":"The hepatoprotective effect of freeze-dried methanolic leaf extract of Ginkgo biloba was evaluated against lantadenes-induced hepatic damage in guinea pigs. The reversed-phase HPLC analysis of lantadenes confirmed the presence of 72.82% of lantadene A. UPLC-ESI-MS analysis showed the presence of ginkgolide B, C, bilobalide and traces of ginkgolide A and J in G. biloba extract. The concentration of ginkgolide B in the sample was found as 0.29%. The elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase due to lantadenes were significantly restored towards normal values by G. biloba extract in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of lantadenes and G. biloba extract on lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were assayed in liver homogenates to evaluate the antioxidant activity. G. biloba extract in a dose-dependent manner produced significant decrease in lantadenes-induced increased levels of LPO. The lantadene-induced decreased levels of SOD, GSH and catalase were elevated by G. biloba extract. The findings of biochemical and antioxidant enzyme levels were supported by gross and histopathological observations. Moreover, liver sections of G. biloba group also showed a marked decrease in apoptosis in comparison to lantadenes group. This study suggested that G. biloba could be used as a promising hepatoprotectant against lantadenes-induced hepatic damage. Future studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanism of hepatoprotection for practical application.
