{"id":86421,"title":"[Estimation of volume of pleural fluid and its impact on spirometrical parameters].","abstract":"In the course of various diseases, there is an accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavities. Pleural fluid accumulation causes thoracic volume expansion and reduction of volume lungs, leading to formation of restrictive disorders. The aim of the study was to estimate the volume of pleural fluid by ultrasonography and to search for the relationship between pleural fluid volume and spirometrical parameters.The study involved 46 patients (26 men, 20 women) aged 65.7 +/- 14 years with pleural effusions who underwent thoracentesis. Thoracentesis was preceded by ultrasonography of the pleura, spirometry test and plethysmography. The volume of the pleural fluid was calculated with the Goecke' and Schwerk' (GS) or Padyku?a (P) equations.The obtained values were compared with the actual evacuated volume. The median volume of the removed pleural fluid was 950 ml. Both underestimated the evacuated volume (the median volume 539 ml for GS and 648 ml for P, respectively). Pleural fluid removal resulted in a statistically significant improvement in VC (increase 0.20 +/- 0.35 ; p < 0.05), FEV1 (increase 0.16 +/- 0.32 l; p < 0.05), TLC (increase 0.30 +/- 0.58 l; p < 0.05) and PEF (0.37 +/- 1 l/s; p < 0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Pleural fluid removal causes a significant improvement in lung function parameters. The analyzed equations for fluid volume calculation do not correlate with the actual volume.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779217","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracentesis","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracentesis"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.767145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.316211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.104059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ls","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls"},{"name":"TLC (TV channel)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLC_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Pleural fluid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_fluid"},{"name":"Victoria Cross","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"648","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/648"},{"name":"950","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/950"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Plethysmograph","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plethysmograph"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Preferred Executable Format","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_Executable_Format"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
