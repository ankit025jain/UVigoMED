{"id":14976,"title":"Absence of the lysosomal protein Limp-2 attenuates renal injury in crescentic glomerulonephritis.","abstract":"In humans, mutations of the intrinsic lysosomal protein SCARB2 are associated with myoclonic epilepsy, collapsing focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, and tubular proteinuria. Mice with deficiency of Limp-2 (the murine homologue) develop tubular proteinuria but not focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and they have a defect in macrophage function. To further elucidate the role of Limp-2 in immune function, we induced anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) model of crescentic glomerulonephritis in wild-type (WT) and Limp-2(-/-) littermates by intraperitoneal injections of nephrotoxic sheep serum. Renal injury and immune responses were assessed on day 14. Compared with WT, Limp-2(-/-) mice had significantly reduced crescent formation, interstitial inflammation and a trend to reduced tubulointerstitial injury. On day 1 during the heterologous phase of the disease, albuminuria was significantly increased in WT but not in Limp-2(-/-) mice. On day 14, albuminuria and renal function were similar in the two groups. There was, however, a significant reduction in the influx of glomerular macrophages and CD4(+) T cells in Limp-2(-/-) mice. Interleukin (IL)-4 and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced. Despite the reduction in numbers of infiltrating cells, flow cytometry showed no difference in macrophage or T-cell numbers in the peripheral blood from untreated mice. The systemic humoral immune response, determined by glomerular mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition and mouse anti-sheep IgG subclass production, was similar in both groups. These data suggest that absence of Limp-2 reduces inflammation in experimental crescentic glomerulonephritis with decreased macrophage and T-cell infiltration in the kidney. It suggests an important role for Limp-2 in mediating the inflammatory response.
