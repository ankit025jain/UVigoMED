{"id":45503,"title":"Reduction of alkaline reflux gastritis and marginal ulcer by modified Braun enteroenterostomy in gastroenterologic reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy.","abstract":"The incidence of alkaline reflux gastritis (ARG) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is high. Although Braun enteroenterostomy (BEE) may reduce ARG, BEE may result in marginal ulcers (MUs) due to the additional anastomotic stoma. We conducted this study to compare clinical outcomes of using a modified BEE (MBEE) with traditional gastrojejunostomy (TGJ), by inducting a purse-string suture instead of an additional anastomotic stoma.All 62 patients underwent standard PD at the Department of Hepatobiliopancreatic Surgery of West China Hospital between January 1, 2008 and January 31, 2012. Demographics, perioperative and postoperative factors, and follow-up morbidity were compared in those patients who underwent MBEE (n = 32, three patients were lost to follow-up) to those who underwent TGJ (n = 30, nine patients were lost to follow-up).Patients who underwent the MBEE experienced a decrease in total morbidity including ARG and MUs, relative to those who underwent TGJ (24.1% versus 58.3%, P = 0.011). With regard to the MBEE group, the total ARG rate was statistically significantly lower compared with the TGJ group (13.8% versus 37.5%, P = 0.046). In addition, the incidence of MUs was reduced.In patients undergoing PD, the MBEE was safely performed with significantly more patients having reduced incidence of ARG and related sequela compared with those who underwent TGJ. These results support further study of patients undergoing gastroenterostomy after resection of the distal stomach in larger, randomized studies.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679695","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.865968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.821218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.770131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.740542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.669734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.610005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.584196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.582072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Stoma (medicine)","weight":0.55759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.455312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Gastroenterostomy","weight":0.357753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterostomy"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
