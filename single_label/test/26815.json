{"id":26815,"title":"Clinical application of three-dimensional echocardiography.","abstract":"Echocardiography is one of the most valuable diagnostic tools in cardiology. Technological advances in ultrasound, computer and electronics enables three-dimensional (3-D) imaging to be a clinically viable modality which has significant impact on diagnosis, management and interventional procedures. Since the inception of 3D fully-sampled matrix transthoracic and transesophageal technology it has enabled easier acquisition, immediate on-line display, and availability of on-line analysis for the left ventricle, right ventricle and mitral valve. The use of 3D TTE has mainly focused on mitral valve disease, left and right ventricular volume and functional analysis. As structural heart disease procedures become more prevalent, 3D TEE has become a requirement for preparation of the procedure, intra-procedural guidance as well as monitoring for complications and device function. We anticipate that there will be further software development, improvement in image quality and workflow.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25081399","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.828651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.70715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.633981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.462771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.428474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.320694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.17927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.130117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Functional analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.0199414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Software development","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"}]}
