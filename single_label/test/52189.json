{"id":52189,"title":"Targeting of memory T cells with alefacept in new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1DAL study): 12 month results of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.","abstract":"Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune targeting of the pancreatic ? cells, likely mediated by effector memory T (Tem) cells. CD2, a T cell surface protein highly expressed on Tem cells, is targeted by the fusion protein alefacept, depleting Tem cells and central memory T (Tcm) cells. We postulated that alefacept would arrest autoimmunity and preserve residual ? cells in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.Of 73 patients assessed for eligibility, 33 were randomly assigned to receive alefacept and 16 to receive placebo. The mean 2 h C-peptide AUC at 12 months increased by 0.015 nmol/L (95% CI -0.080 to 0.110) in the alefacept group and decreased by 0.115 nmol/L (-0.278 to 0.047) in the placebo group, and the difference between groups was not significant (p=0.065). However, key secondary endpoints were met: the mean 4 h C-peptide AUC was significantly higher (mean increase of 0.015 nmol/L [95% CI -0.076 to 0.106] vs decrease of -0.156 nmol/L [-0.305 to -0.006]; p=0.019), and daily insulin use (0.48 units per kg per day for placebo vs 0.36 units per kg per day for alefacept; p=0.02) and the rate of hypoglycaemic events (mean of 10.9 events per person per year for alefacept vs 17.3 events for placebo; p<0.0001) was significantly lower at 12 months in the alefacept group than in the placebo group. Mean HbA1c concentrations at week 52 were not different between treatment groups (p=0.75). So far, no serious adverse events were reported and all patients had at least one adverse event. In the alefacept group, 29 (88%) participants had an adverse event related to study drug versus 15 (94%) participants in the placebo group. In the alefacept group, 14 (42%) participants had grade 3 or 4 adverse events compared with nine (56%) participants in the placebo group; no deaths occurred.Although the primary outcome was not met, at 12 months, alefacept preserved the 4 h C-peptide AUC, lowered insulin use, and reduced hypoglycaemic events, suggesting efficacy. Safety and tolerability were similar in the alefacept and placebo groups. Alefacept could be useful to preserve ?-cell function in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622414","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.81636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.4491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Memory T cell","weight":0.0959066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"CD2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD2"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
