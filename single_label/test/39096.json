{"id":39096,"title":"Effects of ?-sitosterol derived from Artemisia capillaris on the activated human hepatic stellate cells and dimethylnitrosamine-induced mouse liver fibrosis.","abstract":"?-sitosterol is a cholesterol-like phytosterol, which widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Here, anti-fibrotic effect of the ?-sitosterol was studied using the activated human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) model and dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced mouse hepatic fibrosis model.HSCs were activated by transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) and the collagen-1 and ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) expressions were measured at the mRNA and protein level. We also studied the effect ?-sitosterol using DMN-induced mouse hepatic fibrosis model. We then measured the collagen-1 and ?-SMA expression levels in vivo to investigate anti-hepatofibrotic effect of ?-sitosterol, at both of the mRNA and protein level.?-sitosterol down regulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of collagen-1 and ?-SMA in activated HSC. Oral administration of the ?-sitosterol successfully alleviated the DMN-induced mouse liver damage and prevented collagen accumulation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of collagen-1 and ?-SMA were also down regulated in ?-sitosterol treated mouse group.This study shows the effect of ?-sitosterol on the TGF-? -or DMN-induced hepatofibrosis. Hence, we demonstrate the ?-sitosterol as a potential therapeutic agent for the hepatofibrosis.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262005","annotations":[{"name":"Phytosterol","weight":0.842506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytosterol"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hepatic stellate cell","weight":0.632117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_stellate_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.4723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.415856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.267716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Kingdom (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Kupffer cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupffer_cell"},{"name":"Beta-Sitosterol","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Sitosterol"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
