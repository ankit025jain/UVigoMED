{"id":38576,"title":"Hereditary multiple exostoses: anatomical distribution and burden of exostoses is dependent upon genotype and gender.","abstract":"We describe the novel anatomical distribution of exostoses in patients with hereditary multiple exostoses according to their gender and genotype.A prospective database of 143 patients from 65 families with hereditary multiple exostoses was compiled. Patient demographics, genotype and number of exostoses according to anatomical site were recorded. The hand was affected by the greatest proportion of exostoses for both EXT1 (19%) and EXT2 (14%) genotypes and was the most prevalent site for exostoses in patients with an EXT1 genotype (92%). Patients with an EXT1 genotype had a significantly greater number of exostoses compared to those with an EXT2 genotype (2680 vs. 1828, p?=?0.006); however, this was only significantly different for 10 of the 19 anatomical regions examined. Male patients with an EXT1 genotype had a significantly (p?<?0.05) greater number of exostoses affecting their hands, distal radius, proximal humerus, scapular and ribs compared to female patients with the same genotype and males with an EXT2 genotype.The anatomical distribution of exostoses varies according to genotype and gender; however, the reason for this difference is not clear and may relate to different biochemical pathways.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413927","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0444368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Scapular","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapular"},{"name":"Hereditary multiple exostoses","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_multiple_exostoses"},{"name":"Exostosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exostosis"},{"name":"EXT1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXT1"},{"name":"EXT2 (gene)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXT2_(gene)"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Compiler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"1828","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1828"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"27th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_century_BC"},{"name":"Extended file system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_system"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
