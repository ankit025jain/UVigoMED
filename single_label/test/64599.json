{"id":64599,"title":"[Dual role of photosensibilizator merocyanine 540 as a bactericidal agent and immune reaction regulator].","abstract":"Develop conditions for inactivation of staphylococcus by using photosensibilizator merocyanine 540 (MC540) for the production of antigenic preparation (AP). Study some of immune reactions to AP and the possibility of regulation of DTH reaction to AP under the effect of MC540.Merocyanine 540 (MC540, Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) is used in the study. MC540 and Staphylococcus aureus, strain 78 (Sa78) were irradiated by light of a mercury-quartz lamp DRSH-250 (Zelenograd). C56BL/6 line mice were immunized once by subcutaneous administration of AP. DTH reaction was tested 7 days after the immunization. Functional activity of peritoneal exudate macrophages was determined 1 and 9 days after the immunization. Immune modulating effect of MC540 in DTH was determined after its per os administration to mice 1 hour after AP sensibilization.In order to obtain AP, S. aureus suspension at the concentration of 2.5 x 10(7) CFU/ml in 25 microM MC540 solution and 0.25 M NaCl solution were exposed to irradiation for 5 minutes. During DTH reaction induction its intensity dependence on AP dose was revealed. A persistent increase of a lysosomatic enzyme cathepsin D in macrophages of peritoneal exudate after a single administration of AP was noted. During MC540 irradiation an accumulation of photoproducts that have a pronounced immune suppression effect in DTH reaction had a dose-dependent character.Use of saline allows to increase bactericidal potential of a photosensibilizator (PS). However during therapy of localized forms of infection a possible immune modulating effect of PS on macro organism should be considered. By varying PS dose and irradiation time not only maximum bactericidal effect can be achieved but also regulation of inflammatory reactions in the area of PS effect can be ensured.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051690","annotations":[{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.683353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.616654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.566864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.549182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.390506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.299683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.251834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Cathepsin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathepsin"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
