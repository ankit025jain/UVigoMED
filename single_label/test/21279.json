{"id":21279,"title":"Contribution of systematic RT-PCR screening for influenza during the epidemic season.","abstract":"We assessed the systematic RT-PCR screening of patients admitted to an infectious diseases department (IDD), during the 2012-2013 influenza outbreak.Patients admitted with cough and fever underwent a nasopharyngeal smear for RT-PCR screening.Ninety-eight patients were admitted in the IDD, from January 1st to February 22nd, 46 were screened; 11 male and 6 female patients (17.3%, mean age of 68 years) were positive. The diagnoses made in the emergency department, before RT-PCR screening, were most frequently lung infection and sepsis, but influenza in only 4 cases. The diagnosis of influenza led to stopping antibiotics (n=4), initiating curative (n=4) and preventive (n=4) treatments with oseltamivir, and isolating patients to prevent a hospital outbreak.Systematic RT-PCR screening allows a rapid therapeutic management and the prevention of hospital epidemic through appropriate isolation measures.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612505","annotations":[{"name":"Oseltamivir","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.729189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.588917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.501276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"1918 flu pandemic","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"February 22","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_22"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
