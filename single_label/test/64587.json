{"id":64587,"title":"Decreased interleukin 35 and CD4+EBI3+ T cells in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"Interleukin 35 (IL-35) is likely to contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases, as the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene protein 3 (EBI3) is the specificity subunit of IL-35. Nevertheless, until recently, no studies have evaluated its role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans. The objective of this study was to investigate the serum IL-35 level and the percentage of CD4EBI3 T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with SLE and explore the roles of double-positive T cells and IL-35 in the pathogenesis of SLE and the effects of glucocorticoid on these roles.Fifty-five hospitalized patients with SLE were recruited, and 20 volunteers were enrolled as healthy controls. Serum IL-35 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the percentage of CD4EBI3 T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.The serum IL-35 level and the percentage of CD4EBI3 T cells were significantly decreased in patients with active SLE compared with healthy controls and patients with inactive SLE. The serum IL-35 level and the percentage of CD4EBI3 T cells were negatively correlated with the SLE disease activity index. The percentages of CD4EBI3 T cells and serum IL-35 levels in 10 untreated patients with active SLE were increased at days l, 3, and 7 after the treatment with methylprednisolone (0.8 mg·kg·d) compared with the percentages before the treatment.These results demonstrate that abnormalities in IL-35 and CD4EBI3 T cells may play important roles in the pathogenesis of SLE; the percentage of double-positive T cells and the level of IL-35 are parameters for the evaluation of SLE activity and severity.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054737","annotations":[{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.658539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.290752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.2352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.213635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"European Bioinformatics Institute","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
