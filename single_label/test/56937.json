{"id":56937,"title":"Laparoscopic single-site linear salpingostomy for the management of heterotopic pregnancy: a case report.","abstract":"The laparoscopic management of tubal pregnancy component of a heterotopic pregnancy was conducted via multiport approach. In this report we describe a new technique using a single port approach with long-term follow-up.A 27-year-old woman, G4P1031, presented with a heterotopic pregnancy after 2 years of infertility treatment. She underwent multiple surgeries to excise left ovarian cysts, lysis of adhesions, and recanalization of the right fallopian tube. During this time she also experienced a left-sided ectopic pregnancy and was treated with a traditional operative laparoscopy. Upon diagnosis of a heterotopic pregnancy, the decision was made to perform a laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) procedure for treatment of a right ectopic pregnancy via a salpingostomy to preserve her potential for future spontaneous conception. A linear salpingostomy procedure was performed without complications, and the patient was able to carry her intrauterine pregnancy to term.The LESS procedure is effective in resolving an ectopic pregnancy without affecting a coexisting intrauterine pregnancy, and preserving the potential for future spontaneous pregnancies. This approach should be considered for eligible patients with a heterotopic pregnancy who desire preservation of tubal function.
