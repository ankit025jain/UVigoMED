{"id":77232,"title":"FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance in vivo is mediated by PKC?, NADPH oxidase, and oxidative stress.","abstract":"Fat-induced hepatic insulin resistance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. Although PKC and inflammatory pathways have been implicated in fat-induced hepatic insulin resistance, the sequence of events leading to impaired insulin signaling is unknown. We used Wistar rats to investigate whether PKC? and oxidative stress play causal roles in this process and whether this occurs via IKK?- and JNK-dependent pathways. Rats received a 7-h infusion of Intralipid plus heparin (IH) to elevate circulating free fatty acids (FFA). During the last 2 h of the infusion, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with tracer was performed to assess hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. An antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), prevented IH-induced hepatic insulin resistance in parallel with prevention of decreased I?B? content, increased JNK phosphorylation (markers of IKK? and JNK activation, respectively), increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, and impaired insulin signaling in the liver without affecting IH-induced hepatic PKC? activation. Furthermore, an antisense oligonucleotide against PKC? prevented IH-induced phosphorylation of p47(phox) (marker of NADPH oxidase activation) and hepatic insulin resistance. Apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, prevented IH-induced hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance similarly to NAC. These results demonstrate that PKC?, NADPH oxidase, and oxidative stress play a causal role in FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance in vivo and suggest that the pathway of FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance is FFA ? PKC? ? NADPH oxidase and oxidative stress ? IKK?/JNK ? impaired hepatic insulin signaling.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824652","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.817209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.723532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.721848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.576261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.560645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.547075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Sense (molecular biology)","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.12836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"NADPH oxidase","weight":0.0813164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Internal Revenue Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service"},{"name":"IRS1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS1"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
