{"id":10368,"title":"Discovery of a potent and dissociated non-steroidal glucocorticoid receptor agonist containing an alkyl carbinol pharmacophore.","abstract":"Synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a series of alkyl and cycloalkyl containing non-steroidal dissociated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists is reported. This series of compounds was identified as part of an effort to replace the CF3 group in a scaffold represented by 1a. The study culminated in the identification of compound 14, a t-butyl containing derivative, which has shown potent activity for GR, selectivity against the progesterone receptor (PR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), in vitro anti-inflammatory activity in an IL-6 transrepression assay, and dissociation in a MMTV transactivation counter-screen. In a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, 14 displayed prednisolone-like efficacy, and lower impact on body fat and free fatty acids than prednisolone at an equivalent anti-inflammatory dose.
