{"id":80202,"title":"Stress dependent infection cost of the human malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum on its natural vector Anopheles coluzzii.","abstract":"Unraveling selective forces that shape vector-parasite interactions has critical implications for malaria control. However, it remains unclear whether Plasmodium infection induces a fitness cost to their natural mosquito vectors. Moreover, environmental conditions are known to affect infection outcome and may impact the effect of infection on mosquito fitness. We investigated in the laboratory the effects of exposition to and infection by field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum on fecundity and survival of a major vector in the field, Anopheles coluzzii under different conditions of access to sugar resources after blood feeding. The results evidenced fitness costs induced by exposition and infection. When sugar was available after blood meal, infected and exposed mosquitoes had either reduced or equal to survival to unexposed mosquitoes while fecundity was either increased or decreased depending on the blood donor. Under strong nutritional stress, survival was reduced for exposed and infected mosquitoes in all assays. We therefore provide here evidence of an environmental-dependant reduced survival in mosquitoes exposed to infection in a natural and one of the most important parasite-mosquito species associations for human malaria transmission.
