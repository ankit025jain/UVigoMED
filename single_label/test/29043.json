{"id":29043,"title":"Variation of adverse drug reaction profile of platinum-based chemotherapy with body mass index in patients with solid tumors: an observational study.","abstract":"Toxicity of cancer chemotherapy may be affected by nutritional status of patients which is reflected in the body mass index (BMI). We sought to assess whether the adverse drug reaction (ADR) profile of platinum-based chemotherapy varies with BMI status.Adult patients of either sex, suffering from a solid tumor (lung, head and neck, ovary, gall bladder, stomach, colon) and started on platinum-based chemotherapy as initial treatment were included. BMI at chemotherapy commencement was obtained from medical records. Events were recorded and graded as per Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group Common Toxicity Criteria-patients' complaints; clinically evident signs and laboratory reports were considered. Frequencies of individual adverse events were compared between low BMI (<18.5 kg/m(2)) and satisfactory BMI groups. Similar comparisons were done for events with grades 2 or 3 severities.A total of 50 patients were observed over a 3-month period of whom 17 (34%) belonged to the low BMI group. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, anemia, alopecia, tinnitus and paresthesia were the commonly observed ADRs. The frequencies of anemia (P = 0.152) and vomiting (P = 0.140) and severity of grades of nausea (P = 0.066), anemia (P = 0.120) and paresthesia (P = 0.128) showed a higher trend in the low BMI group though differences were not statistically significant. The frequencies of tinnitus (P = 0.021) and paresthesia overall (P = 0.036) were significantly higher in the low BMI group.ADR profile of primary platinum-based chemotherapy appears to be partly influenced by BMI. This suggests the importance of maintaining adequate nutrition in patients and the need for greater vigilance in those with low BMI.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced
