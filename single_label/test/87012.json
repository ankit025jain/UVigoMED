{"id":87012,"title":"Hematologic profile of hematophagous Desmodus rotundus bats before and after experimental infection with rabies virus.","abstract":"Hematophagous Desmodus rotundus bats play an important role in the rabies lifecycle. This study describes the hematological profile of these bats before and after experimental infection with rabies virus.Cells counts were performed in a Neubauer chamber.The average values of erythrocytes and leucocytes counts in blood before experimental infections were 9.97 × 10(6)mm3 and 4.80 × 10(3)mm3, respectively. Neutrophils represented 69.9% of white blood cells and the lymphocytes represented 26.9%. Following the experimental infections, the average numbers of erythrocytes and leucocytes was 9.43 × 106mm3 and 3.98 × 10(3)mm3, respectively. Neutrophils represented 40% of white blood cells and the lymphocytes represented 59%.The hematological profile given in this study can serve as reference values for D. rotundus bats.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075489","annotations":[{"name":"Rabies","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"},{"name":"Hematophagy","weight":0.819934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematophagy"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.758399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Bat","weight":0.487499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Rabies virus","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_virus"},{"name":"Reference range","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_range"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Common Vampire Bat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vampire_Bat"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Neubauer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neubauer"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Belgian general election, 2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_general_election,_2010"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
