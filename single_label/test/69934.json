{"id":69934,"title":"Effect and mechanism of miRNA to osteosarcoma cell.","abstract":"MicroRNA has proved to be low expression in many tumor cells. In addition, it was also proved that as a kind of cancer suppressor gene, miR-199a-3p in miRNA can affect the growth and invasion ability of tumor cells. This paper aims to discuss the effect of miRNA to osteosarcoma cell. It used synthetic mature miR-199a-3p sequence simulants to transfect osteosarcoma cell and took negative contrast sequence (NC mimics) transfection cell as negative contrast. After transfection, qRT-PCR was applied to detect the expression quantity of miR-199a-3p in every group. Western blot method was applied to detect the expression level of MCL-(1) protein and shear situation of PARP in groups of cells. Flow cytometry was used for detecting apoptosis rate of cells and the experimental result was made a statistical analysis. The result shows that in cells from experimental group of transfection miR-199a-3p sequence simulants, expression quantity of mi-R-199a-3p significantly increased while MCL?ยน protein expression decreased compared to control group. In addition, shear level of PARP protein and apoptosis rate of cells increased. The differences all had statistical significance (P<0.05). It was concluded that miR-199a-3p can effectively promote the apoptosis rate of osteosarcoma cells.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262514","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.92372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.816171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.731997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.437638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.261649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.141172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.11264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Medial collateral ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"MCL1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCL1"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"Electron configuration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration"},{"name":"Suppressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"List of Red Dwarf concepts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Red_Dwarf_concepts"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
