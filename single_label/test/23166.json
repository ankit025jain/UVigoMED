{"id":23166,"title":"Four cases of bacteremia caused by Oscillibacter ruminantium, a newly described species.","abstract":"The genus Oscillibacter has been known since 2007, but no association to human infection has been reported. Here, we present four cases of Oscillibacter ruminantium bacteremia from hospitals across Denmark from 2001 to 2010. Correct identification is now possible, as the 16S rRNA gene sequence was recently made publicly available.
