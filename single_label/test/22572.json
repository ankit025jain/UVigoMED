{"id":22572,"title":"Disposable surgical face masks for preventing surgical wound infection in clean surgery.","abstract":"Surgical face masks were originally developed to contain and filter droplets containing microorganisms expelled from the mouth and nasopharynx of healthcare workers during surgery, thereby providing protection for the patient. However, there are several ways in which surgical face masks could potentially contribute to contamination of the surgical wound, e.g. by incorrect wear or by leaking air from the side of the mask due to poor string tension.To determine whether disposable surgical face masks worn by the surgical team during clean surgery prevent postoperative surgical wound infection.We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register on 23 October 2013; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the use of disposable surgical masks with the use of no mask.Two review authors extracted data independently.Three trials were included, involving a total of 2113 participants. There was no statistically significant difference in infection rates between the masked and unmasked group in any of the trials.From the limited results it is unclear whether the wearing of surgical face masks by members of the surgical team has any impact on surgical wound infection rates for patients undergoing clean surgery.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532167","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.594375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.592606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.247594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Ovid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"CINAHL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINAHL"},{"name":"EBSCO Industries","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBSCO_Industries"},{"name":"Nasopharynx","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharynx"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Goaltender mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender_mask"},{"name":"2110s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2110s"},{"name":"Surgical mask","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask"},{"name":"Drop (liquid)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_(liquid)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"}]}
