{"id":88265,"title":"A new building block: costo-osteochondral graft for intra-articular incongruity after distal radius fracture.","abstract":"Even with the invention of locking plates, intra-articular fractures of distal radius with extreme comminution remain a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. Osteochondral graft is a potential choice to reconstruct the articular defect. We report a patient who had a fracture of distal radius with costo-osteochondral graft for articular reconstruction which has not yet been described in the English literature. At nine-year follow-up, he was pain free and had full range of movement of the wrist. The authors suggest that costo-osteochondral graft could be an option with satisfactory result.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875518","annotations":[{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.725052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.570793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.36899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Radius (bone)","weight":0.368039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.310266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.189774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Invention","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0392565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"English literature","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_literature"},{"name":"Comminution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comminution"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Toy block","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_block"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
