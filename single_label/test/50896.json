{"id":50896,"title":"Trends in the prevalence of major cardiovascular disease risk factors among Korean adults: results from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1998-2012.","abstract":"Mortality from coronary heart disease in Korea has increased continuously, but there are few comprehensive national data on trend in the prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in this population. We examined the trends in the prevalence of major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, from 1998 through 2012 in a representative Korean population.Using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (1998) to V (2010-2012), we selected the adults aged?30 yr who participated in both a health examination and health interview survey.From 1998 to 2012, significant decrease in the prevalence of hypertension was observed in both men (32.5 to 31.5%) and women (26.9 to 24.3%). Smoking rates decreased only in men (65.1 to 47.0%), whereas the prevalence of diabetes did not change over time. Conversely, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia significantly increased from 7.2% to 12.6% for men and from 8.4% to 14.9% for women, whereas the rates of awareness and treatment for hypercholesterolemia were relatively lower than that of hypertension and diabetes. During the period, prevalence of obesity significantly increased from 26.8% to 38.1% only in men.The increased prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and obesity may have contributed to the increasing trend in the mortality from coronary heart disease in Korea. Further population-based surveillance of blood cholesterol levels and obesity needs to be performed, and national strategies for improvement of these factors should be established in Korea.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742812","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.799732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.566864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.23988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.194091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Spanish Empire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Fad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
