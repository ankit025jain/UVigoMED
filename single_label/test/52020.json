{"id":52020,"title":"Correlation between serum lipids and 1-hour postload plasma glucose levels in normoglycemic individuals.","abstract":"One-hour plasma glucose (1-h PG) level of ? 155 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) predicts the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus among individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). In addition, high triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are risks factors for development of diabetes mellitus in the future.To examine the association between 1-h PG levels and serum lipid profiles in individuals with NGT.We enrolled 736 individuals with NGT who underwent a 75-g OGTT. They were divided into 2 groups, those with 1-h PG levels < 155 mg/dL (n = 543) and those with 1-h PG levels ? 155 mg/dL (n = 193). Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to assess correlations between 1-h PG levels and lipid profiles.The multiple linear regression analyses showed that 1-h PG levels negatively correlated with HDL-C in individuals with NGT who had 1-h PG levels ? 155 mg/dL as well as those with 1-h PG levels < 155 mg/dL (? = -0.137, P = .001 and ? = -0.214, P = .003, respectively). In addition, 1-h PG levels positively correlated with log-transformed TG/HDL-C ratio in both groups (? = 0.098, P = .032 and ? = 0.152, P = .035, respectively). Moreover, even after adjusting for confounding parameters, TG was higher and HDL-C was lower in individuals with NGT who had 1-h PG levels ? 155 mg/dL compared with those who had 1-h PG levels < 155 mg/dL.HDL-C levels and TG/HDL-C ratios closely correlate with 1-h PG levels in individuals with NGT.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636182","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.939184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.893237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.594895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.451707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.173181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"High-Level Data Link Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"543","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/543"},{"name":"736","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/736"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Engineering tolerance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance"}]}
