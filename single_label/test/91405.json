{"id":91405,"title":"Long-term patient outcomes after surgical stabilization of rib fractures.","abstract":"Rib fractures are common, and can be disabling. Recently, there has been increased interest in surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF). It is difficult to define long-term benefits of the procedure. This is a descriptive study of patient outcomes after SSRF.SSRF patients between April 2010 and August 2012 at a Level I trauma center were identified. Data were collected from the medical records. A telephone survey asking about pain, satisfaction, and employment was administered to patients after hospital discharge.One hundred-one patients met inclusion criteria. Fifty (50%) patients completed the survey. Indications for SSRF included flail chest, displaced fractures, pain, and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation. Pain was gone at 5.4 ± 1.1 weeks post discharge. Satisfaction with SSRF on a scale of 1 to 10 was 9.2 ± .2. Ninety percent of employed patients returned to the same work at 8.5 ± 1.2 weeks.SSRF patients are satisfied and are able to return to normal activity with few limitations. A prospective study using modern rib fixation technology is needed to further define benefits.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507379","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.485162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.404832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.381024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.365833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.218455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Level I trauma center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_I_trauma_center"},{"name":"Flail","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flail"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Flail chest","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flail_chest"},{"name":"Rib fracture","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_fracture"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Indication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
