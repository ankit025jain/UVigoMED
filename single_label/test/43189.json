{"id":43189,"title":"Compound K-induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma MHCC97-H cells in vitro.","abstract":"An intestinal bacterial metabolite of ginseng protopanaxadiol saponin, 20-O-(?-D-glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-protopanaxadiol (compound K), has been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. However, the precise mechanisms induced by compound K in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remain unclear. In order to examine possible apoptotic mechanisms, we investigated the anticancer effect of compound K in MHCC97-H. MTT assay showed that compound K inhibited the proliferation of MHCC97-H cells with a relatively low toxicity in normal hepatoma cells. Cell cycle progression and cell staining showed an increase in apoptotic sub-G1 fraction. Treatment of MHCC97-H with compound K also induced a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) and DNA damage. Further study showed that compound K upregulated Fas, FasL, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and downregulated pro-caspase-9, pro-caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner, and it also inhibited Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest that compound K significantly inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in MHCC97-H cells through Fas- and mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent pathways in human HCC cells.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804620","annotations":[{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.615269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.531033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.524178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.405489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Ginseng","weight":0.38911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginseng"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.343158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Fas ligand","weight":0.143958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_ligand"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Cell (journal)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(journal)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"}]}
