{"id":90214,"title":"Mild traumatic brain injury in children.","abstract":"Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in childhood, especially those related to participation in sports and recreation activities, are receiving increased public awareness. Research is beginning to show that even mild TBIs (mTBIs) may not be mild at all, and could have serious long-term effects on the health, behavior, and cognitive abilities of children. With the development of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's TBI tools for professionals, a more evidenced and systematic way is available to help recognize and manage mTBI. New research on predictor values showing that symptoms may not be the best way to assess the severity of mTBI will help to change how mTBIs are managed in the future.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640311","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.781668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.434308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
