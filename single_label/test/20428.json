{"id":20428,"title":"An outbreak of Candida albicans folliculitis masquerading as Malassezia folliculitis in a prison population.","abstract":"Several inmates from a non-air-conditioned prison were sent to the University of Texas Medical Branch dermatology clinic for unexplained eruptions not responding to various treatments. They were initially diagnosed with Malassezia folliculitis based on clinical examination and histological findings. The patients' cultures from skin scrapings, however, revealed Candida albicans confirmed by growth on Mycosel agar and further by the germ tube production method. Five cases were brought to the clinic, but at least 30 other inmates were reported to have similar cutaneous eruptions. Given that these patients were generally immunocompetent, this is a rare finding. Factors favoring pseudohyphal growth for these patients included use of topical steroids and/or systemic antibiotics and hot and humid climate. All patients' folliculitis resolved with fluconazole and/or antifungal cream with no further complications.
