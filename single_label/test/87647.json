{"id":87647,"title":"[Hygienic assessment of the radiation risk of radon emanation in the Altai Krai].","abstract":"The unique climatic and geographical location of the Altai Krai determines the specific radiation dose load for the population, which is composed of the complex of radiological indices, the structure of which is largely dependent on the type of locality and, to a greater extent due to the action of radon, which is currently the main source of internal radiation of the population of upland districts and adjacent territories. There was performed a hygienic assessment of the radiation risk and the expected decline in life expectancy and population health due to radon exposure in the model areas of the Altai Krai. To calculate the additional risk there were used some models for radiation risk extrapolation: a risk constant model, model GSF (Jacobi's model), Lubin model (TSE/AGE/WL) and BEIR VI model for smoking and nonsmoking population, as well as the combined model. The lowest values of the radiation risk and the expected decline in life expectancy are typical for Charyshsko-Ust-Kalmanskaya zone, the maximum--for Kuryinsko--Pospelikhinskaya zone.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051739","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Radon","weight":0.642039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.58421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.523264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.1401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Altai Krai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Krai"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population health","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_health"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Portable Sound Format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Sound_Format"},{"name":"Highland (geography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_(geography)"},{"name":"Districts of Peru","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Peru"},{"name":"Location (geography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_(geography)"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Emanationism","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanationism"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"Altai Mountains","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Mountains"},{"name":"Extrapolation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Primorsky Krai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsky_Krai"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Lubin","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubin"}]}
