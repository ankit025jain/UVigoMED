{"id":4713,"title":"Ectopic presence of tooth within the mandibular condyle.","abstract":"This article describes the case of a 41-year-old woman who presented with the complaint of crepitation sound and mild pain in the left temporomandibular joint area. Panoramic radiographs taken to rule out degenerative or arthritic changes in the joints demonstrated a radiopaque mass within the left condyle. Cone beam computed tomography scans revealed an ectopic tooth located centrally within the left condyle. Thus, while considered rare, the mandibular condyle can be a possible location of an ectopic tooth.
