{"id":9401,"title":"Elevation of intra-abdominal pressure by pneumoperitoneum decreases pancreatic perfusion in an in vivo porcine model.","abstract":"The goal of this study is to examine changes in pancreatic perfusion due to pneumoperitoneum using perfusion CT in vivo.Three pigs were studied. Under general anesthesia, pneumoperitoneum was induced to 16 mm Hg. Perfusion CT scans were acquired at a rate of 1 image per 2 seconds for 60 seconds. Scans were repeated 5 days later without pneumoperitoneum using the same protocol, in the same animals. The time density curve, color map, peak enhancement, time to peak, blood flow, blood volume, and permeability were evaluated.In the presence of pneumoperitoneum, peak enhancement in radiodensity was decreased and time to peak was increased, and both blood flow and blood volume decreased. However, there was no consistent change in permeability observed.This study demonstrates that pneumoperitoneum quantitatively results in decreased blood flow and blood volume to the pancreas in an in vivo animal model.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710250","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.684558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.630783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.40578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.401956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.31903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.129465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"16 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film"},{"name":"Pneumoperitoneum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumoperitoneum"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"May 20","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_20"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Colour look-up table","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_look-up_table"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Permeability (electromagnetism)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)"}]}
