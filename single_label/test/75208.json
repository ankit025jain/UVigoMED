{"id":75208,"title":"Trigeminal neuralgia--case and treatment analysis at the Department of Oral Surgery of the University Hospital Dubrava.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to explore certain risk factors for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), assess the prevalence of misdiagnoses of TN made by primary care dentists, compare the treatment practice for TN at the Department of Oral Surgery with the guidelines, and the importance of interdisciplinary approach in TN treatment. The study included 237 patient records (70 men and 167 women, aged 5-91 years) referred to the Department under the diagnosis of TN. From their medical records, demographic data, referral diagnose, clinical diagnose, additional diagnostic procedures and treatment were analysed. Neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve affects predominantly elderly female population, while the impact of the season on the incidence of the disease has not been determined. The most common therapy used at the Department were blockades, carbamazepine or their combination. 63.3% patients were referred for further diagnostic tests following the first examination. The number of misdiagnosed cases referred by primary care dentists (33.6%) points that better training in diagnosing TN is needed for the dental practitioners. The treatment methods at the Department need to be harmonized with the latest guidelines on neuralgia treatment. Due to the complexity of etiological factors, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145008","annotations":[{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.746831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Trigeminal nerve","weight":0.655272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.548117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.520555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.468416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Trigeminal neuralgia","weight":0.313223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.235226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.215424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Neuralgia","weight":0.130857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia"},{"name":"Oral surgery","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_surgery"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0229663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Tennessee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"}]}
