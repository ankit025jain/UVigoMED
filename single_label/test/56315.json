{"id":56315,"title":"Provider use of collaborative goal setting with glaucoma patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this preliminary study was to describe the extent to which providers used collaborative goal setting and individualized assessment with patients who were newly prescribed glaucoma medications.English-speaking glaucoma suspect patients from six ophthalmology clinics who were newly prescribed glaucoma medications had their medical visits videotaped and were interviewed after the visits. The videotapes were transcribed and coded to examine provider use of collaborative goal setting and individualized assessment.Fifty-one patients seeing 12 ophthalmologists participated. Providers gave patients glaucoma treatment options during 37% of the visits; only five providers gave patients treatment options Providers asked for patient treatment preferences in less than 20% of the visits; only two providers asked for patient treatment preferences. Providers were significantly more likely to ask African American patients for their preferences or ideas concerning treatment than non-African American patients (Pearson ?² = 4.1, p = 0.04). Providers were also significantly more likely to ask African American patients about their confidence in using glaucoma medication regularly than non-African American patients (Pearson ?² = 8.2, p = 0.004). Providers asked about patient views about glaucoma in less than 20% of the visits; five providers asked patients their views on glaucoma and its treatment. Providers were significantly more likely to ask African American patients about their views on glaucoma than non-African American patients (Pearson ?² = 5.62, p = 0.02).Eye care providers often did not use collaborative goal setting or conduct individualized assessments of patient views on glaucoma when prescribing treatment for the first time.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705480","annotations":[{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.623718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.462611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.404972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.391329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Videotape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape"},{"name":"Suspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Lester B.
