{"id":23736,"title":"[Cerebral vasculitis with delirium in neurosyphyllis].","abstract":"In a 40-year-old man with delirium, right-sided facial palsy and anisocoria (right?>?left) were noticed. He had been suffering from headaches for four weeks prior to admission. The patient's HI-virus status was positive and he used illicit drugs regularly. Therefore, the symptoms were initially thought to be drug-induced. EXAMINATION AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory tests showed a pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with 929 cells/Âµl. The MRI of the brain revealed several ischemic strokes in the territories of the middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery in the left hemisphere. A highly positive IgG CSF/serum index confirmed the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.An antibiotic regime with penicillin was administered, during which the clinical symptoms remitted and the liquor pleocytosis nearly normalized. The intracranial stenoses persisted for three months even after therapy with nimodipine, atorvastatin, and antibiotics. Therefore they are presumed to be a result of the lues-associated vasculitis.In patients with delirium the initially suspected underlying condition needs to be challenged. Early cerebral MRI, lumbar puncture and ultrasound of the cerebral arteries are mandatory to exclude menigoencephalitis.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473849","annotations":[{"name":"Lumbar puncture","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_puncture"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.890634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Neurosyphilis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosyphilis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.75335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Delirium","weight":0.745665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cerebral vasculitis","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_vasculitis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.629021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.467958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Nimodipine","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimodipine"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.361706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.361358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Anisocoria","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisocoria"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.215256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.124353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.114742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Atorvastatin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin"},{"name":"Pleocytosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleocytosis"},{"name":"Posterior cerebral artery","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Lateralization of brain function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
