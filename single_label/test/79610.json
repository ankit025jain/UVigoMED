{"id":79610,"title":"Malaria vectors in San Jos√© del Guaviare, Orinoquia, Colombia.","abstract":"This study was conducted to determine Anopheles species composition and their natural infectivity by human Plasmodium in 2 localities with the highest malaria transmission in San Jose del Guaviare, Guaviare, Colombia. A total of 1,009 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using human landing catches during 8 months in 2010. Anopheles darlingi was the most abundant (83.2%) followed by An. albitarsis s.l. (8.6%), Anopheles braziliensis (3.8%), An. oswaldoi s.l. (1%), and An. rangeli (0.3%). Anopheles darlingi showed the highest human biting rate, and it was found naturally infected with Plasmodium vivax VK210 (0.119%) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. All species were collected biting both indoors and outdoors. Anopheles darlingi showed biting activity overnight with an indoor peak between 1200-0100 h. Therefore, we recommend that malaria prevention strategies focus on 1) insecticide-treated nets to reduce human-vector contact when people are most exposed and unprotected; 2) accurate diagnoses; 3) adequate treatment for patients; 4) more timely epidemiological notification; and 5) improved entomological surveillance.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102591","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.757159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.750072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.70525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.677889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.589038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Entomology","weight":0.508002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.442888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.196893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mosquito net","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Malaria prophylaxis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_prophylaxis"},{"name":"Guaviare Department","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaviare_Department"},{"name":"San Jose del Guaviare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_del_Guaviare"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Infectivity","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectivity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Landing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing"},{"name":"Wilderness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Caught","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught"},{"name":"Jos","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"Species richness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_richness"},{"name":"Notification system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_system"},{"name":"San Jose, California","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California"}]}
