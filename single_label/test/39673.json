{"id":39673,"title":"[Retrospective analysis of correlative factors between digestive system injury and anticoagulant or antiplatelet-agents].","abstract":"To explore the correlative factors and clinical characteristics of digestive system injury during the treatment of anticoagulant and (or) antiplatelet-agents.A total of 1 443 hospitalized patients on anticoagulant and (or) antiplatelet-agents from January 2010 to December 2013 at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were analyzed retrospectively.Their length of hospital stay was from 5 to 27 days. Most of them were elderly males (n = 880, 61.0%) with an average age of (62 Â± 6) years. 1 138 patients (78.9%) were farmers, workers or someone without a specific occupation. During the treatment of anticoagulant/antiplatelet-agents, statistical difference existed (P = 0.01) between positively and negatively previous digestive disease groups for actively newly occurring digestive system injury (16.0% (41/256) vs 15.9% (189/1 187)). After the dosing of anticoagulant and (or) antiplatelet-agents, 57 (66.3%, 57/86) patients were complicated by hemorrhage of digestive tract, taking 62.9% (61/97) of all positive result patients for Helicobacter pylori test. Comparing preventive PPI group with no PPI group, there was no marked statistical differences (P = 2.67) for digestive system complication (including hemorrhage of digestive tract) while receiving anticoagulant and (or) antiplatelet-agents (13.9% (74/533) vs 17.1% (156/910)). During anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet-agent therapy, 185 patients (12.8%) were complicated by peptic ulcer or peptic ulcer with bleeding, 40 patients (2.8%) had erosive gastritis and 5 (0.3%) developed acute gastric mucosal lesions. And 42 of 76 patients complicated by hemorrhage of digestive tract underwent endoscopic hemostasis while 2 patients were operated. Ninety-seven patients (6.7%) died, including 61 (62.9%, 61/97) from hemorrhage of digestive tract. The remainder became cured, improved and discharged. Moreover, no significant statistical differences existed (P = 2.29) among three combination group (aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin), two combination group (aspirin, clopidogrel), exclusive aspirin group and exclusive warfarin group in short-term (<27 d) mortality.It is necessary to clearly dictate the details of medication to the patients not highly educated. Elder, male, history of digestive system disease and Helicobacter pylori infection are possibly highly risk correlative factors for digestive system complications during anticoagulant/antiplatelet-agent therapy. The short-term protective effect of routine dose of PPI is inconspicuous. No significant correlation exists between short-term mortality and the dosage (or type) of anticoagulant/antiplatelet-agents.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146743","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Warfarin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.855207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.806801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.583707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.476426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.475463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.200403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.194517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sambucus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambucus"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
