{"id":43078,"title":"[Evaluation of the therapeutic response after stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumors].","abstract":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy takes more and more an important place in the therapeutic arsenal of primitive and secondary liver tumours. The administration of ablative radiation doses can result in specific changes to both the tumour and the healthy hepatic parenchyma, relative to conventional radiation therapy, making the assessment of local changes after stereotactic body radiation therapy, in terms of local control and reaction of healthy tissue, often difficult. It is mandatory to standardize and simplify our evaluation criteria to benefit from a better understanding of the effectiveness of this new treatment modality and allow better reproducibility of available imaging exams. This article presents a literature review of the various radiological changes observed after stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumours according to the multiple assessment methods used to determine local control. From the data available, we recommend using modified RECIST criteria proposed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), as objective and relevant criteria of local control after stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumours.
