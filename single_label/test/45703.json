{"id":45703,"title":"A comparison of total versus partial omentectomy for advanced gastric cancer in laparoscopic gastrectomy.","abstract":"Minimally invasive surgery has been slowly introduced into the field of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) surgery. However, the appropriate extent of omentectomy during laparoscopic gastrectomy for AGC is unknown.From July 2004 to December 2011, 146 patients with serosa-negative advanced gastric cancer were divided into the total omentectomy group (TO group, n = 80) and the partial omentectomy group (PO group, n = 66). The clinicopathologic characteristics, surgical outcomes, recurrence pattern and survival were analyzed.There were no significant differences in the clinicopathologic features between the two groups, except for depth of invasion; more T3 (subserosal invasion) cases (65%) were included in total omentectomy group (P = 0.011). The mean time for PO was significantly shorter (35.1 ± 13.0 min) than TO (50.9 ± 15.3 min) (P %0.001), and there were two omentectomy-related complications in the TO group: spleen and mesocolon injuries. Recurrence occurred in 14 (17.5%) and 5 (7.6%) cases in the TO and PO group, respectively (P = 0.054). Disease-free survival (TO versus PO: 81.5% versus 89.3%, P = 0.420) and disease-specific survival (TO versus PO: 89% versus 94.7%) were not significantly different between the two groups. In the case-matched analysis using propensity score matching, there was no difference in disease-free survival (TO versus PO: 83.3% versus 90.5%, P = 0.442).Partial omentectomy might be an oncologically safe procedure during laparoscopic gastrectomy for serosa-negative advanced gastric cancer, similar to early gastric cancer.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669875","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.468236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.445375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.376084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.36559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.208333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.150838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Greater omentum","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Propensity score matching","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Recursion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"2003 invasion of Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"},{"name":"Automatic gain control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_gain_control"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"United States presidential election, 2004","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2004"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
