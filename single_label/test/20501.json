{"id":20501,"title":"Surgical wound infection rates in Spain: data summary, January 1997 through June 2012.","abstract":"The Indicadores Cl√≠nicos de Mejora Continua de la Calidad (INCLIMECC) program was established in Spain in 1997.INCLIMECC is a prospective system of health care-associated infection (HAI) surveillance that collects incidence data in surgical and intensive care unit patients. The protocol is based on the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance system, formerly known as the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) system, and uses standard infection definitions from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each hospital takes part voluntarily and selects the units and surgical procedures to be surveyed.This report is a summary of the data collected between January 1997 and June 2012. A total of 370,015 patients were included, and the overall incidence of surgical wound infection (SWI) was 4.51%. SWI rates are provided by NHSN operating procedure category and NNIS risk index category. More than 27% of the patients received inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis, the main reason being unsuitable duration (57.05% of cases).Today, the INCLIMECC network includes 64 Spanish hospitals. We believe that an HAI surveillance system with trained personnel external to the surveyed unit is a key component not only in infection control and prevention, but also in a quality improvement system.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655902","annotations":[{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.889584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.671265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.659439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.638616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.634105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.492908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Publicly funded health care","weight":0.345942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.322407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.305461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.21971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.163905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Today (NBC program)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"}]}
