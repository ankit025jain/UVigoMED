{"id":88573,"title":"[Treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures with percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty using calcium phosphate cement].","abstract":"To assess the clinical outcomes of balloon kyphoplasty assisted with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) in treating osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVF).From January 2009 to January 2011, 26 patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures were treated with balloon kyphoplasty assisted with CPC, including 31 vertebrae. There were 15 males and 11 females with an average age of (71.67 +/- 4.36) years old (ranged from 60 to 89 years). Course of disease was from 0.5 to 7 days with an average of 3.2 days. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the oswestry disability index (ODI). Vertebral height loss and kyphotic angle were measured by X-rays.All patients were followed up for 10 to 24 months with an average of 18 months. Before operation, 24 hours after operation and at final follow-up, VAS scores were 7.91 +/- 1.20, 3.22 +/- 1.12, 1.92 +/- 0.83, respectively; ODI scores were 40.00 +/- 1.15, 17.00 +/- 2.12, 13.00 +/- 1.42, respectivesly; vertebral heights were (18.21 +/- 3.21), (23.82 +/- 3.10), (21.85 +/- 3.24) mm, respectivesly; vertebral kyphosis angles were (18.21 +/- 3.21) degrees, (7.42 +/- 3.13) degrees, (10.01 +/- 3.11) degrees, respectivesly. There was significant difference between preoperation and 24 hours after operation, and between final follow-up and preoperation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between final follow-up and 24 hours after operation (P > 0.05).Balloon kyphoplasty assisted with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is effective for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVF), which can expeditiously relieve pain and effectively rebuild height of vertebral body and kyphotic angle, and also has advantages of minimal trauma and good security.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826476","annotations":[{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.911944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.579085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.560442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.55743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.556754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"One Day International","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Communist Party of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Open Virtualization Format","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"}]}
