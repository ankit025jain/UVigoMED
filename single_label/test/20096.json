{"id":20096,"title":"Idle central venous catheter-days pose infection risk for patients after discharge from intensive care.","abstract":"This prospective observational study measured idle central venous catheter (CVC)-days (no medical indication), and ward clinicians' adherence to evidence-based practices for preventing short-term central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). In 340 patients discharged from ICU over a 1-year period, 208 of 794 CVC-days (26.2%) were idle. Interventions to prevent CLABSIs were poorly implemented. Ward clinicians need education regarding risk management strategies to prevent CLABSIs, and clear accountability processes for prompt catheter removal are recommended.
