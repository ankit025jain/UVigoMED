{"id":69364,"title":"[Morbidity, mortality, and overall survival after radical cystectomy: comparison of single-center results with the literature and a nomogram].","abstract":"Overall survival (OS) after radical cystectomy is determined. It is investigated retrospectively whether prediction is possible using a nomogram. A comparison with published data from \"high-volume\" centers is performed.Data of 100 consecutive radical cystectomies performed between 2006 and 2012 were collected. Age, ASA score, tumor stage, urinary diversion, and Clavien score were recorded. The OS after 2 and 5 years was recorded (Kaplan-Meier analysis) and the nomogram-based predictive accuracy was calculated.Median age was 70.8 years. A T?2, T3, T4, N+ stage was present in 40, 37, 23, and 43%, respectively. Urinary diversion: neobladder, conduit, and ureterostomy were performed in 35, 53, and 12%. The 30-day mortality was 1%. At follow-up, there were 95 patients with a median observation time of 19.8 months. The 2- and 5-year OS were 0.68 and 0.45 (Kaplan-Meier analysis) and 0.65 and 0.39, respectively (nomogram). A significant correlation was observed (rs=0.79; rs=0.80). Compared to published \"high-volume\" series, no relevant differences concerning morbidity, mortality, and OS were observed. However, there are significant differences concerning the characteristics of \"high-volume centers\".In this series, the OS can be predicted by a multivariate nomogram. The results are comparable with published data. There is no clear definition of a \"high-volume center\".","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449358","annotations":[{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.616339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.601503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.277041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Nomogram","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0926852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"ASA physical status classification system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASA_physical_status_classification_system"},{"name":"Ureterostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureterostomy"},{"name":"Urinary diversion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_diversion"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Aqueduct","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"T4 (Channel 4)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T4_(Channel_4)"}]}
