{"id":53934,"title":"Having pancreatic cancer with tumoral loss of ATM and normal TP53 protein expression is associated with a poorer prognosis.","abstract":"To determine how often loss of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein expression occurs in primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and to determine its prognostic significance.The expression of ATM and TP53 was determined by immunohistochemistry in 397 surgically resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (Hopkins; Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD), a second set of 159 cases (Emory; Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA), and 21 cancers after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Expression was correlated with the clinicopathologic parameters, including survival.Tumoral ATM loss was observed in one cancer known to have biallelic inactivation of ATM and 50 of the first 396 (12.8%) cases, significantly more often in patients with a family history of pancreatic cancer (12/49; 24.5%) than in those without (38/347; 11.0%; P = 0.019). In the Hopkins series, ATM loss was associated with a significantly decreased overall survival in patients whose cancers had normal TP53 expression (P = 0.019) and was a significant independent predictor of decreased overall survival (P = 0.014). Seventeen (10.7%) of 159 Emory cases had tumoral ATM loss and tumoral ATM loss/normal TP53 was associated with poorer overall survival (P = 0.1). Multivariate analysis of the combined Hopkins/Emory cases found that tumoral ATM loss/normal TP53 was an independent predictor of decreased overall survival [HR = 2.61; confidence interval (CI), 1.27-5.37; P = 0.009]. Of 21 cancers examined after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, one had tumoral loss of ATM; it had no histologic evidence of tumor response.Tumoral loss of ATM protein was detected more often in patients with a family history of pancreatic cancer than in those without. Patients whose pancreatic cancers had loss of ATM but normal TP53 had worse overall survival after pancreatic resection.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486587","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.785997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.519073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.487302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.447417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Emory University","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University","weight":0.229359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Atlanta","weight":0.161683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_School_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Baltimore","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0898974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
