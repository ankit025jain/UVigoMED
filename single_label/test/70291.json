{"id":70291,"title":"Therapy of metastatic malignant melanoma: on the way to individualized disease control.","abstract":"After decades of therapeutic frustration, the identification of some fundamental molecular drivers finally set the stage for the development of targeted therapies of metastatic malignant melanoma. With the invention of B-RAF inhibitors, targeting the mutated and activated B-RAF molecule in the MAP kinase cascade, objective responses can be achieved in about 50% of those cases harbouring this specific mutation. However, the effects are often short-lived with an average duration of 5-6 months. Hence, the challenge is to make such remissions stable and prevent secondary resistance. Currently, both the combination of targeted drugs and the invention of effective immunomodulating antibodies, e.g., anti-CTLA4 as well as anti-PD1, hold great promise to proceed on the way to individualized disease control, if not, as a remote aim, cure of this deadly cancer. Finally, progress has been made in identification and targeting of cancer stem cells, which seem to exhibit a kind of primary drug resistance and create the source of relapses and growth of clones with acquired secondary drug resistance.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207371","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.801223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.728709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.597707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.582523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.556487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.422587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.282513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Invention","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0220502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
