{"id":67130,"title":"The effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms and inflammatory markers in maintenance hemodialysis patients: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","abstract":"This study was designed to investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on depression and chronic inflammation in hemodialysis patients.Fifty-four maintenance hemodialysis patients were randomized to ingest two omega-3 (each containing 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo capsules, three times daily for 4 months.Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, ferritin, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and ratios of IL-10 to IL-6 and IL-10 to TNF-? were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.Omega-3 supplement lowered BDI score significantly after 4 months of intervention. Among pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, only serum ferritin level and IL-10 to IL-6 ratio showed significant changes in favor of omega-3 supplement during the study. In linear regression model adjusted for baseline values, omega-3 treatment was a significant predictor of reduced serum CRP, ferritin, and iPTH levels, and increased IL-10 to IL-6 ratio. No significant association was found between the anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant effects of omega-3 supplement.Supplemental use of omega-3 fatty acids decreases depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients apart from their anti-inflammatory effects.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643636","annotations":[{"name":"Eicosapentaenoic acid","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.904628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Docosahexaenoic acid","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.841375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.839625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.799206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.786694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.605038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.563147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.282358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"}]}
