{"id":52711,"title":"Renegade homeostatic cytokine responses in T1D: drivers of regulatory/effector T cell imbalance.","abstract":"Homeostatic cytokines contribute to the balance between regulatory and effector T cells (Tregs and Teffs respectively) and are necessary to maintain peripheral tolerance. These cytokines include IL-2 that supports Treg and IL-7 and IL-15 that drive Teff. In overt settings of lost tolerance (i.e. graft rejection), IL-2 Treg signatures are decreased while IL-7 and IL-15 Teff signatures are often enhanced. Similar cytokine profile imbalances also occur in some autoimmune diseases. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), there are underlying defects in the IL-2 pathway and Teff cytokine blockade can prevent and treat diabetes in NOD mice. In this review, we summarize evidence of IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 genetic and cellular alterations in T1D patients. We then discuss how the combined effect of these cytokine profiles may together contribute to altered Treg/Teff ratios and functions in T1D. Implications for combination therapies and suggestions for integrated cytokine and Treg/Teff biomarker development are then proposed.
