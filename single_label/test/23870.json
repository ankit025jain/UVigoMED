{"id":23870,"title":"Nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission of Streptococcus pneumoniae in American Indian households after a decade of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use.","abstract":"Young children played a major role in pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, acquisition, and transmission in the era before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) use. Few studies document pneumococcal household dynamics in the routine-PCV7 era.We investigated age-specific acquisition, household introduction, carriage clearance, and intra-household transmission in a prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage in 300 American Indian households comprising 1,072 participants between March 2006 and March 2008.Pneumococcal acquisition rates were 2-6 times higher in children than adults. More household introductions of new pneumococcal strains were attributable to children <9 years than adults ?17 years (p<0.001), and older children (2-8 years) than younger children (<2 years) (p<0.008). Compared to children <2 years, carriage clearance was more rapid in older children (2-4 years, HRclearance 1.53 [95% CI: 1.22, 1.91]; 5-8 years, HRclearance 1.71 [1.36, 2.15]) and adults (HRclearance 1.75 [1.16, 2.64]). Exposure to serotype-specific carriage in older children (2-8 years) most consistently increased the odds of subsequently acquiring that serotype for other household members.In this community with a high burden of pneumococcal colonization and disease and routine PCV7 use, children (particularly older children 2-8 years) drive intra-household pneumococcal transmission: first, by acquiring, introducing, and harboring pneumococcus within the household, and then by transmitting acquired serotypes more efficiently than household members of other ages.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465365","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.700817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.481407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.398527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.318736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0527282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Transmitter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Major (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States)"},{"name":"Median income per household member","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income_per_household_member"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Introduced species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
