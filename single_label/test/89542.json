{"id":89542,"title":"[Internal and external fixation for open tibial fracture. Case presentation].","abstract":"Accidents currently rank first among causes of complex lower limb injuries. The most common open long bone fractures are tibial fractures. Estimates indicate that there are 492,000 new fractures every year, with a prevalence of 100,000 cases that do not heal.Young, female patient who underwent emergency surgery for a Gustilo III A open comminuted fracture of the left proximal tibia. Surgical toilette was performed several times until the soft tissues improved. Then internal fixation of large fragments was performed with a cortical screw and Professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambras' external fixator was used to heal the fracture. The combined approach consisting of internal and external fixation is discussed within the setting of these difficult fractures.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707616","annotations":[{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.88878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.757568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.510774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.186224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.11362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
