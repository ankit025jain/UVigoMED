{"id":31022,"title":"PSP toxins profile in ascidian Microcosmus vulgaris (Heller, 1877) after human poisoning in Croatia (Adriatic Sea).","abstract":"Toxins known to cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) syndrome in humans that can have serious economic consequences for aquaculture were determined in ascidians of the genus Microcosmus. Significant concentrations of toxins were confirmed in all tested samples collected from the western coast of Istria Peninsula (Adriatic Sea, Croatia) when six people were poisoned following the consumption of fresh ascidians. Several species of bivalves that were under continuous monitoring had not accumulated PSP toxins although they were exposed to the same environmental conditions over the survey period. In the present study, HPLC-FLD with pre-column oxidation of PSP toxins has been carried out to provide evidence for the first human intoxication due to consumption of PSP toxic ascidians (Microcosmus vulgaris, Heller, 1877) harvested from the Adriatic Sea. Qualitative analysis established the presence of six PSP toxins: saxitoxin (STX), decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX), gonyautoxins 2 and 3 (GTX2,3), decarbamoylgonyautoxins 2 and 3 (dcGTX2,3), gonyautoxin 5 (GTX5) and N-sulfocarbamoylgonyautoxins 1 and 2 (C1,2), while quantitative analysis suggested STX and GTX2,3 as dominant toxin types and the ones that contribute the most to the overall toxicity of these samples with concentrations near the regulatory limit.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418175","annotations":[{"name":"Genus","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Aquaculture","weight":0.759893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.733774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.586326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Shellfish","weight":0.44917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.425887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Bivalvia","weight":0.401407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia"},{"name":"Saxitoxin","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxitoxin"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.256148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Paralytic shellfish poisoning","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralytic_shellfish_poisoning"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Adriatic Sea","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea"},{"name":"Harvest (wine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_(wine)"},{"name":"Istria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria"},{"name":"Ascidiacea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascidiacea"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"List of peninsulas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_peninsulas"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
