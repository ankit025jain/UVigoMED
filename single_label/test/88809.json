{"id":88809,"title":"Monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur: natural history and predisposing factors for disease progression.","abstract":"Monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur has a variable clinical course, despite its reported limited tendency to progress. We investigated the natural history and predisposing factors for progression of dysplasia in a group of 76 patients with a mean follow-up of 8.5 years (2.0 to 15.2). Of these, 31 (41%) presented with an asymptomatic incidental lesion while 45 (59%) presented with pain or a pathological fracture. A group of 23 patients (30%) underwent early operative treatment for pain (19: 25%) or pathological fracture (4: 5%). Of the 53 patients who were initially treated non-operatively, 45 (85%) remained asymptomatic but eight (15%) needed surgery because of pain or fracture. The progression-free survival of the observation group was 81% (sd 6.4%) at five-years follow-up. An initial presentation of pain (p < 0.001), a limp (p < 0.001), radiological evidence of microfracture (p = 0.001) and younger age (< 17 years) (p = 0.016) were significant predisposing factors for disease progression. The risk of experiencing pain or pathological fracture is considerable in monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur. Patients presenting with pain, a limp or radiological evidence of microfracture have a high chance of needing surgical treatment.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788504","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.560623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.455117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.401318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"History","weight":0.120329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.113544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Fibrous dysplasia of bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrous_dysplasia_of_bone"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Limp","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limp"}]}
