{"id":66396,"title":"Prevention of prostate cancer with vitamins - current perspectives.","abstract":"Cancer prostate is the most common solid malignancy in males of developed countries. With increasing knowledge of the aetiology, pathogenesis and natural history of the disease, influences of dietary factors on prostate cancer development have become more evident. There is ample evidence in the literature of significance of dietary constituents for prostate cancer including vitamins A, D and E. Different vitamins have been found to effect the growth and proliferation of prostate cancer cells as evident in epidemiological, experimental and clinical studies. Various factors play the major role in determining the relationship between these vitamins and prostate cancer in terms of environmental, pharmacological, or genetic aspects. To explore these aspects, the present article reviews the literature on the present status of vitamin use for prevention and management of prostate cancer.
