{"id":63642,"title":"Transumbilical single-incision endoscopic splenectomy: report of ten cases.","abstract":"To investigate the feasibility and clinical application of transumbilical single-incision endoscopic splenectomy using conventional laparoscopic instruments.Between 2010 and 2012, transumbilical single-incision endoscopic splenectomy was performed in 10 patients in our department, of whom 4 had refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 4 had enlarged splenic cyst and 2 had splenic hematoma. A 2.5-cm curved incision was made at the lower umbilicus edge, and a 10 mm laparoscope was inserted into the middle of the incision. A 5-mm harmonic scalpel was placed on the right side, and a 5-mm auxiliary instrument on the left side of the laparoscope. Splenic ligaments were incised with a harmonic scalpel, and the splenic pedicle was cut with an Endo-gastrointestinal anastomosis. The spleen was dissected and placed in a large retrieval bag, blended, and then removed.All transumbilical single-incision endoscopic splenectomies were performed successfully with mean operative time of 80 ± 5 min and mean blood loss of 150 ± 20 mL. Conversion to laparotomy or multi-port laparoscopic surgery was not required in all cases. All patients were discharged on postoperative days 4-6. During the postoperative hospitalization period, no painkillers were required. No intra-abdominal complications such as infection, ascites, gastric leakage, pancreatic leakage, or wound infection occurred in any case during the 6-mo follow-up.Transumbilical single-incision endoscopic splenectomy using conventional laparoscopic instruments is technically feasible and safe in selected patients.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415880","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Navel","weight":0.795044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.660418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Scalpel","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.275016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.183444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"}]}
