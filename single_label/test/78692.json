{"id":78692,"title":"Efficacy and safety of AM-101 in the treatment of acute inner ear tinnitus--a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intratympanic AM-101 in patients with persistent acute inner ear tinnitus after acute acoustic trauma, idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL), or acute otitis media.Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with follow-up visits on Days 7, 30, and 90.Twenty-eight European sites (academic tertiary referral centers and private ENT practices).248 patients aged 16 to 65 years.Three intratympanic injections of AM-101 (0.27 or 0.81 mg/ml) or placebo over 3 consecutive days.Efficacy was assessed by changes in minimum masking level (MML; primary end point), loudness match, tinnitus loudness, tinnitus annoyance, and sleep difficulties on a 0 to 100 numerical rating scale, THI-12 questionnaire, and patient global impression of change. Safety was evaluated using the frequency of clinically relevant hearing deterioration and adverse events.The study overall failed to demonstrate a treatment benefit based on the change in MML. However, AM-101 0.81 mg/ml showed statistically significantly better improvement for tinnitus loudness, annoyance, sleep difficulties, and tinnitus impact in patients with tinnitus after noise trauma or otitis media. The subgroup of ISSNHL-related tinnitus patients did not show conclusive results. The study drug and I.T. injections were well tolerated.The study established proof of concept for AM-101 in the treatment of tinnitus arising from cochlear glutamate excitotoxicity. Patient-reported outcomes seem to be more relevant and reliable efficacy measures for assessing treatment-related changes in tinnitus than psychoacoustic tests.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603353","annotations":[{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.748245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Excitotoxicity","weight":0.727383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.720795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.692776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.690269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.625521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.616901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.439645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Psychoacoustics","weight":0.360448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.354409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.348979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.337968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.279334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.211382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.120615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.0945851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Proof of concept","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Loudness","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Annoyance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annoyance"}]}
