{"id":66889,"title":"Tumour characteristics and surgical treatment of renal cell carcinoma in Sweden 2005-2010: a population-based study from the national Swedish kidney cancer register.","abstract":"Tumour characteristics, preoperative work-up and surgical treatment in patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) between 2005 and 2010, and changes over time were studied in a national population-based cohort.The National Swedish Kidney Cancer Register (NSKCR) contains information on histopathology, Fuhrman grade and clinical stage at presentation, and on the preoperative work-up and surgical treatment of patients with RCC. Between 2005 and 2010, 5553 RCC patients were registered in the NSKCR, 99% of those registered in the National Cancer Registry.During the study period the mean tumour size decreased from 70 to 64 mm (p = 0.024) and the frequency of metastatic RCC decreased from 22% to 15% (p < 0.001). The use of preoperative chest computed tomography increased from 59% to 84%. In total, 4229 (76%) patients were treated with curative intent, 3453 (82%) underwent radical nephrectomy, 606 (14%) partial nephrectomy (PN) and 170 (4%) cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation. In tumours up to 4 cm, PN was performed in 33% of the surgically treated patients. PN irrespective of size increased from 8% to 20% and laparoscopic nephrectomy increased from 6% to 17% during the period. In patients with metastatic RCC, 55% underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy.The NSKCR explores population-based data on the clinical handling of patients with RCC. This study, between 2005 and 2010, shows significant decrease in tumour size and metastatic RCC at presentation, a more complete preoperative work-up, and significantly increased use of PN and laparoscopic nephrectomy in Sweden.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666102","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Cryotherapy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.721885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.718644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.54584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.488977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.405461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.393353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.371708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.360144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.318447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
