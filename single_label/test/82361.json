{"id":82361,"title":"Information for patients undergoing treatment for toothwear with resin composite restorations placed at an increased occlusal vertical dimension.","abstract":"Toothwear is affecting increasing numbers of the population. In the past, treatment of patients whose teeth were affected by toothwear often involved the reduction of these teeth for crowns; a severe form of toothwear. Contemporary management of such cases is by the bonding of resin composite restorations to the worn and wearing surfaces, with these restorations being placed at an increased occlusal vertical dimension. The advantage of the technique is its minimal- or non-intervention nature and its high reported degree of patient satisfaction. There are, however, short-term disadvantages to the technique, such as the potential for lisping, pain from the teeth which will be subject to axial orthodontic tooth movement, and difficulty in chewing on the posterior teeth if these are discluded. It is therefore important, as with any treatment, that the advantages and disadvantages are fully explained to the patient. This paper therefore describes the clinical technique and presents a Patient Information Leaflet that the author has used for over five years.Patients should be advised regarding the disadvantages and advantages of any technique.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640475","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.613399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.144305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Dental composite","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Non-interventionism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interventionism"},{"name":"Vertical dimension of occlusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_dimension_of_occlusion"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0202688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Leaflet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaflet"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Patient information leaflet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_information_leaflet"},{"name":"Lisp","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
