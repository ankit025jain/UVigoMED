{"id":9722,"title":"Detection of enterovirus genome sequence from diarrheal feces of goat.","abstract":"Goat diarrheal feces were subjected to metagenome analysis by the next-generation sequencing. Nucleotide sequences with homology to enteroviruses were obtained. Primers for RT-PCR were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of these sequences at the 5'-untranslated region, and we determined 563 bp nucleotide sequences that showed homology to bovine-like and ovine enteroviruses (77-87 %). We named the virus detected in this study goat enterovirus G1 (GEV-G1). In the phylogenetic analysis, GEV-G1 belonged to a cluster containing ovine enteroviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first report on nucleotide sequences of an enterovirus infecting Japanese goats.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691818","annotations":[{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.819453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.781823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.736609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.690543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.631667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.624397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Metagenomics","weight":0.619924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.3973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Enterovirus","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterovirus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
