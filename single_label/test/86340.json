{"id":86340,"title":"Meta-analysis of first-line therapies in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harboring EGFR-activating mutations.","abstract":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib have been compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapies for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutations. This meta-analysis compares gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and chemotherapy.Literature search was performed using relevant keywords. Direct and indirect meta-estimates were generated using log-linear mixed-effects models, with random effects for study. Study-to-study heterogeneity was summarized using I statistics and predictive intervals (PIs).Literature search yielded eight randomized phase 3 clinical trials comparing gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib with chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer during the last 5 years. Hazard ratio meta-estimates for progression-free survival were for gefitinib versus chemotherapy 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.63; 95% PI, 0.22-0.88), erlotinib versus chemotherapy 0.25 (95% CI, 0.15-0.42; 95% PI, 0.11-0.55), afatinib versus chemotherapy 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.75; 95% PI, 0.20-0.98), erlotinib versus gefitinib 0.57 (95% CI, 0.30-1.08; 95% PI, 0.24-1.36), afatinib versus gefitinib 1.01 (95% CI, 0.53-1.92; 95% PI, 0.41-2.42), and erlotinib versus afatinib 0.56 (95% CI, 0.27-1.18; 95% PI, 0.22-1.46). Results for overall response rate and disease control rate were similar. There was no evidence that gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy.Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib out-performed chemotherapy in terms of progression-free survival, overall response rate, and disease control rate. Differences among gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib were not statistically significant.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787964","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Gefitinib","weight":0.643186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefitinib"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.527163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.474413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Erlotinib","weight":0.395022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlotinib"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.390355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.222103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.12464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0665899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Afatinib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.027094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
