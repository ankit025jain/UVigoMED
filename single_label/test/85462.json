{"id":85462,"title":"Applications of ultrasonography in respiratory intensive care.","abstract":"Emerging evidence suggests that ultrasonography of lung is a fast, inexpensive, widely available bed-side diagnostic tool which is useful for quick and early diagnosis of respiratory diseases. It is useful in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates and has good accuracy in identifying consolidation and alveolar-interstitial syndrome. This technique can also be useful in the immediate evaluation of patients with dyspnoea or acute respiratory failure in the respiratory intensive care unit and helps in monitoring treatment response. Ultrasonography of lung has also been found to be useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, traumatic lung contusion and lung consolidation as well. There is a need for developing specific guidelines for establishing the standards of training and education regarding lung ultrasonography in India.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930204","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"India","weight":0.73481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pulmonary contusion","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_contusion"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.616241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Pulmonary consolidation","weight":0.550612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_consolidation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.109096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"}]}
