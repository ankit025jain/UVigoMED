{"id":17469,"title":"Protective efficacy of piperine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","abstract":"Piperine a trans-trans isomer of 1-piperoyl-piperidine was evaluated for its immunomodulatory activity to enhance the efficacy of rifampicin in a murine model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In-vitro immunomodulation of piperine was tested on mouse splenocytes for lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and macrophage activation. Protective efficacy of piperine was tested in a mice infection model of M. tuberculosis for the activation of Th-1 response and synergistic combination efficacy with rifampicin. Murine splenocytes exposed to piperine exhibited proliferation of T and B cell, increased Th-1 cytokines and enhanced macrophage activation. Piperine (1 mg/kg) in mice infected with M. tuberculosis activated the differentiation of T cells into Th-1 sub-population (CD4+ / CD8+ subsets). There was an increase in secretion of Th-1 cytokines (IFN-? and IL-2) by these cells. The qRT-PCR studies revealed corresponding increases in the mRNA transcripts of IFN-? and IL-2 in the infected lung tissues. Combination of piperine and rifampicin (1 mg/kg) exhibited better efficacy of and resulted in additional 1.4 to 0.8 log reduction in lung cfu as compared to rifampicin alone. The up-regulation of Th1 immunity by piperine can be synergistically combined with rifampicin to improve its therapeutic efficacy in immune-compromised TB patients.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880706","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Isomer","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.675724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.451825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
