{"id":90752,"title":"Cervical corpectomy with ultra-low-dose rhBMP-2 in high-risk patients: 5-year outcomes.","abstract":"Twenty-four consecutive patients with cervical spondylosis who were treated with cervical corpectomy and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) with standalone anterior instrumentation were evaluated. Mean number of levels fused was 2.4. There were significant improvements in visual analog scale neck pain and Oswestry Disability Index scores and cervical lordosis. Cervical corpectomy with a lower dose of rhBMP-2 was found to be safe and efficacious for patients who are at a higher risk for pseudarthrosis.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579211","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Lordosis","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordosis"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.170212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Human skeleton","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skeleton"},{"name":"Oswestry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswestry"},{"name":"Spondylosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylosis"},{"name":"Pseudarthrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudarthrosis"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Instrumentation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(music)"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neck pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
