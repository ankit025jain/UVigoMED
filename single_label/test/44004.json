{"id":44004,"title":"The diagnostic importance of matrix metalloproteinase-7 and nestin in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","abstract":"The importance of the matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and nestin immunomarkers, C-kit proto-oncogene (CD117), and the efficiency of the Ki-67 proliferation index for gastrointestinal stromal tumors were evaluated.This study was conducted by examining the microscope slides of 72 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors that were sent to the pathology laboratory between 2007 and 2012. Immunohistochemical staining for CD117, MMP-7, nestin, and marker of proliferation Ki-67 was performed. The correlations between the positive results for Ki-67, CD117, MMP-7, and nestin were evaluated relative to the tumor characteristics of size, localization, grade, cellular type, cellularity, cytology type, growth pattern, ulceration, necrosis, hemorrhage, invasion depth, and lymph node metastasis.The tumor was localized in the stomach in 42 of the patients, the intestines in 19, the colon in 7, and the rectum in 4. Comparisons among the groups showed that MMP-7 was correlated with the tumor grade (p<0.001), cellularity (p<0.009), cytologic atypia (p<0.001), ulceration (p=0.002), necrosis (p<0.001), and tumor size (p=0.001). Nestin was correlated with the tumor grade (p=0.013), and tumor size (p=0.024). Correlations among CD117, MMP-7, nestin, and Ki-67 were examined. Nestin and Ki-67 were both significantly correlated with CD117 and MMP-7 [(r=0.279, p=0.018), (r=0.322, p=0.006), (r=0.386, p=0.001), (r=0.386, p=0.002)], respectively.MMP-7 and nestin may be beneficial as markers, given their sensitivity to gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755685","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cytopathology","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathology"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.817741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.779367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"CD117","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD117"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.560932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.534454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.488347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.322652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.243394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.194581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.159888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Protooncogene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protooncogene"},{"name":"MMP7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP7"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
