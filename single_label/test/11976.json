{"id":11976,"title":"Excitotoxic stimulation of brain microslices as an in vitro model of stroke.","abstract":"Examining molecular mechanisms involved in neuropathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke, can be difficult when using whole animal systems. As such, primary or 'neuronal-like' cell culture systems are commonly utilized. While these systems are relatively easy to work with, and are useful model systems in which various functional outcomes (such as cell death) can be readily quantified, the examined outcomes and pathways in cultured immature neurons (such as excitotoxicity-mediated cell death pathways) are not necessarily the same as those observed in mature brain, or in intact tissue. Therefore, there is the need to develop models in which cellular mechanisms in mature neural tissue can be examined. We have developed an in vitro technique that can be used to investigate a variety of molecular pathways in intact nervous tissue. The technique described herein utilizes rat cortical tissue, but this technique can be adapted to use tissue from a variety of species (such as mouse, rabbit, guinea pig, and chicken) or brain regions (for example, hippocampus, striatum, etc.). Additionally, a variety of stimulations/treatments can be used (for example, excitotoxic, administration of inhibitors, etc.). In conclusion, the brain slice model described herein can be used to examine a variety of molecular mechanisms involved in excitotoxicity-mediated brain injury.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562045","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Guinea pig","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"},{"name":"Excitotoxicity","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.765108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.625646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.577481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.465467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nervous tissue","weight":0.431792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_tissue"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.391439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.361142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.281543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Neuropathology","weight":0.0582433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology"},{"name":"List of regions in the human brain","weight":0.0381318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"}]}
