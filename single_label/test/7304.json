{"id":7304,"title":"Chikungunya antibodies detected in non-human primates and rats in three Indian Ocean islands after the 2006 ChikV outbreak.","abstract":"The role of terrestrial vertebrates in the epidemiology of chikungunya disease is poorly understood. We evaluated their exposure and amplification role during the 2006 chikungunya outbreak in the Indian Ocean. Blood samples were collected from 18 mammalian and reptile species from Reunion Island, Mauritius and Mayotte. Among the 1051 samples serologically tested for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), two crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and two ship rats (Rattus rattus) proved to be exposed to CHIKV. CHIKV RNA was not detected in 791 analyzed sera. Our results confirm the preferential infection of simian primates and suggest that other vertebrates played a poor or no role in CHIKV transmission during the 2006 outbreak.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885529","annotations":[{"name":"Reptile","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile"},{"name":"Mauritius","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.756096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Vertebrate","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Crab-eating macaque","weight":0.61705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab-eating_macaque"},{"name":"Indian Ocean","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.584601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Black rat","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rat"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Terrestrial animal","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.497909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Simian","weight":0.451781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian"},{"name":"Chikungunya","weight":0.340579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikungunya"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.20874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ocean","weight":0.157004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Mayotte","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayotte"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Ship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
