{"id":65818,"title":"Prostate biopsy volume predicts final tumor volume.","abstract":"To assess the ability of prostate biopsy volume to effectively predict actual tumor volume, and whether increasing the number of prostate biopsy cores improves the ability to forecast actual tumor volume.765 patients who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy (2009-2010) were identified. Of these, 663 had complete demographics, biopsy, and final pathology data available. The number ofbiopsy samples, biopsy tumor volume, and actual tumor volume were calculated from pathology reports.Data from 663 radical prostatectomy specimens indicated a positive linearrelationship between biopsy tumor volume and actual tumor volume (R=0.524, P< 0.0001). The number ofbiopsy samples collected (i.e., < or =6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, or > or =15) did not affect the ability of biopsy tumor volume to predict final tumor volume.The routine collection of biopsy tumor volume may prove useful in predicting actual tumor volume and the construction of more effective preoperative nomograms.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772836","annotations":[{"name":"Nomogram","weight":0.280448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.254722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.154457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.141968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.141444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0197861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"765","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/765"},{"name":"524","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/524"},{"name":"1112","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1112"},{"name":"663","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/663"},{"name":"1314","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1314"},{"name":"910","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/910"},{"name":"Weather forecasting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
