{"id":85357,"title":"A case of systemic arterial supply to the right lower lobe of the lung: imaging findings and review of the literature.","abstract":"Systemic arterialization of the lung without pulmonary sequestration is the rarest form of anomalous systemic arterial supply to the lung. This condition is characterised by an aberrant arterial branch arising from the aorta which supplies an area of lung parenchyma with normal bronchopulmonary anatomy. It is often diagnosed following investigation of an incidental cardiac murmur or based on abnormal imaging, as most patients are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. Thoracic computed tomography and computed tomography angiography are generally the most useful diagnostic tests. We present a case of a 22-year old female who was diagnosed with systemic arterial supply to a portion of otherwise normal right lower lobe following investigation of low volume haemoptysis.
