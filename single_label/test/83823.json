{"id":83823,"title":"Abdominal reoperation and mesh explantation following open ventral hernia repair with mesh.","abstract":"This study sought to identify the incidence, indications, and predictors of abdominal reoperation and mesh explantation following open ventral hernia repair with mesh (OVHR).A retrospective cohort study of all patients at a single institution who underwent an OVHR from 2000 to 2010 was performed. Patients who required subsequent abdominal reoperation or mesh explantation were compared with those who did not. Reasons for reoperation were recorded. The 2 groups were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis (MVA).A total of 407 patients were followed for a median (range) of 57 (1 to 143) months. Subsequent abdominal reoperation was required in 69 (17%) patients. The most common reasons for reoperation were recurrence and surgical site infection. Only the number of prior abdominal surgeries was associated with abdominal reoperation on MVA. Twenty-eight patients (6.9%) underwent subsequent mesh explantation. Only the Ventral Hernia Working Group grade was associated with mesh explantation on MVA.Abdominal reoperation and mesh explantation following OVHR are common. Overwhelmingly, surgical complications are themost common causes for reoperation and mesh explantation.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241955","annotations":[{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.615107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.548081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.37611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.211634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hernia repair","weight":0.127937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia_repair"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"407","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/407"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Volt-ampere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt-ampere"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"}]}
