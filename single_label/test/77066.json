{"id":77066,"title":"Sexuality and psychopathological aspects in premenopausal women with metabolic syndrome.","abstract":"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors that have been suggested to impact female sexual function.This study aims to assess the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) in premenopausal women with MetS compared with healthy controls (HC). Psychopathological aspects and the relationship to FSD were also evaluated in both groups.Two hundred four premenopausal women, of whom 98 had diagnosis of MetS, were asked to complete the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), and the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire (MHQ). Routine laboratory tests and anthropometric measurements were routinely performed.FSFI and FSDS questionnaires, prevalence of FSD, and MHQ scores.In the MetS group compared with the HC group, we found: a lower global FSFI score (P=0.005), higher prevalence of pathological scores compared with HC group, and lower scores in the desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm domains. An inverse correlation between the FSFI score and the number of risk factors for MetS was detected. MetS women reported significantly higher total scores in the somatization and depression domains when compared with the HC group. The logistic regression showed that high triglycerides (odds ratio [OR] 3.097; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.272-7.542; P=0.026) and somatization (OR 7.068; CI 95% 2.291-21.812; P=0.001) are independently associated with FSD in premenopausal women.Our results indicate a higher prevalence of sexual dysfunction in MetS women. A number of risk factors for MetS are positively associated with FSD and higher triglycerides seem to be the strongest predictors of sexual dysfunction. Psychopathological dimensions such as somatization are strongly associated with sexual dysfunction.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848980","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.886534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Orgasm","weight":0.737751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.703602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.586821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.584596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.448994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Female sexual arousal disorder","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_sexual_arousal_disorder"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.419015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.313159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.281118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.274121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Arousal","weight":0.22529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.195179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vaginal lubrication","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_lubrication"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Somatization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hypertriglyceridemia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertriglyceridemia"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
