{"id":63506,"title":"Targeted liposomal drug delivery systems for the treatment of B cell malignancies.","abstract":"Nanoparticulate systems have demonstrated significant potential for overcoming the limitations of non-specific adverse effects related to chemotherapy. The treatment of blood malignancies employing targeted particulate drug delivery systems presents unique challenges and considerable research has been focused towards the development of targeted liposomal formulations for B cell malignancies. These formulations are aimed at achieving selectivity towards the malignant cells by targeting several cell surface markers which are over-expressed in that specific malignancy. CD19, CD20, CD22 and CD74 are few of such markers of which CD19, CD22 and CD74 are internalizing and CD20 is non-internalizing. Systems which have been developed to target both types of these cell surface markers are discussed. Specifically, the efficacy and development of targeted liposomes is considered. A number of studies have demonstrated the advantages of targeted liposomal systems encapsulating doxorubicin or vincristine. However, liposomal encapsulation of newer anti-neoplastic agents such as AD 198 which are superior to doxorubicin should be considered.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433007","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.808582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.695363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.413128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.3215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Cluster of differentiation","weight":0.120812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_of_differentiation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"CD22","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD22"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
