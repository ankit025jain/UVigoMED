{"id":47777,"title":"Long-term follow-up of ulcerative colitis patients treated on the basis of their cytomegalovirus antigen status.","abstract":"To clarify the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) activation and antiviral therapy based on CMV antigen status on the long-term clinical course of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.UC patients with flare-up were divided into CMV-positive and -negative groups according to the CMV antigenemia assay. The main treatment strategy provided for the patients in the CMV-positive group comprised a dose reduction of corticosteroids and administration of ganciclovir.The median number of days to initial remission was significantly greater for the patients in the CMV-positive group (21 d vs 16 d, P = 0.009). However, the relapse rate after remission and colectomy rate during more than 30 mo of observation did not differ between the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of ganciclovir was the only independent factor for avoiding colectomy in patients of the CMV-positive group.CMV antigen status did not significantly affect the long-term prognosis in UC patients under treatment with appropriate antiviral therapy.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574719","annotations":[{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.701007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.657951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.576026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Ganciclovir","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganciclovir"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.452609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.425848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.359623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0875503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"}]}
