{"id":84861,"title":"Expression characterization of testicular DMRT1 in both Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells of polyploid gibel carp.","abstract":"Dmrt1 has been suggested to play significant roles in sex determination and differentiation, but various expression patterns and cell types have been observed in the testis of vertebrates. Polyploid gibel carp, because of the multiple modes of unisexual gynogenesis and sexual reproduction, has become a unique case to explore the evolution of sex determination and differentiation. However, the sex-determination related genes in gibel carp have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized 4 cDNAs of Dmrt1 genes. Subsequently, a polyclonal antibody specific to CagDMRT1 was prepared to examine its expression and distribution patterns at protein level. Significantly, both relative real-time PCR and Western blot detection confirmed predominant expression of CagDmrt1 in the adult testis of gibel carp. Moreover, the intensive expression of CagDMRT1 around spermatogenic cysts was revealed during spermatogenesis. And, following immunofluorescence co-localization of CagDMRT1 and CagVASA, a prominent CagDMRT1 expression in Sertoli cells and a mild CagDMRT1 expression in spermatogenic cells including spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes were clearly characterized. The CagDMRT1 signal in Sertoli cells is extensively distributed in both nuclei and cytoplasm, while the CagDMRT1 in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes is mainly expressed in nuclei, and there is only the remained CagDMRT1 signal in the cytoplasm of secondary spermatocytes. These findings suggest that DMRT1 should be related to testis differentiation and spermatogenesis in gibel carp.
