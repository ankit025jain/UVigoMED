{"id":15977,"title":"Deep neck infections: a retrospective study of 142 patients.","abstract":"To present the symptoms, clinical courses, and management of patients with deep neck infections (DNIs) encountered in our department in 2003-2011.We reviewed the records of 142 patients diagnosed with DNIs that required hospitalization during an 8 y period. In addition, we conducted a follow-up of the patients by telephone interview.The incidence of DNIs has increased significantly in our hospital since 2008. Tonsillitis (15%) and foreign bodies (11%) were the two leading causes. In 57% of the patients, the cause of DNI was not known. The most common underlying systemic disease was diabetes mellitus, noted in 21% of our patients. Branchial cleft cyst was the underlying etiology in five of the 11 patients with recurrent neck infections.Closer attention should be paid to DNI patients, especially to those with diabetes and hypertension. Recurrence of DNI was uncommon and suggested the existence of a branchial cleft cyst.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090811","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.846632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tonsillitis","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsillitis"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.444156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.371153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gill","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Branchial arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branchial_arch"},{"name":"Branchial cleft cyst","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branchial_cleft_cyst"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
