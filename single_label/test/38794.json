{"id":38794,"title":"Multimodal neuromonitoring in pediatric cardiac anesthesia.","abstract":"Despite significant improvements in overall outcome, neurological injury remains a feared complication following pediatric congenital heart surgery (CHS). Only if adverse events are detected early enough, can effective actions be initiated preventing potentially serious injury. The multifactorial etiology of neurological injury in CHS patients makes it unlikely that one single monitoring modality will be effective in capturing all possible threats. Improving current and developing new technologies and combining them according to the concept of multimodal monitoring may allow for early detection and possible intervention with the goal to further improve neurological outcome in children undergoing CHS.
