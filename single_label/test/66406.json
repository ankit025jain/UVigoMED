{"id":66406,"title":"microRNA-133b downregulation and inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting matrix metallopeptidase-9 in renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"microRNA (miRNA)-133b has been revealed to be downregulated in head and neck/oral, bladder, human non-small cell lung, colorectal and esophageal squamous cell cancer. The present study examined the expression of miR-133b in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines and the effects of miRNA-133b on RCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of miR-133b in RCC cell lines. Following transfection of miR-133b, the expression of miR-133b was examined and a cell viability assay, cell migration assay, cell invasion assay, western blot analysis and luciferase assay were conducted in RCC cell lines. The present study revealed that miRNA?133b was downregulated and inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in 786-O and A498 cells. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, the present study provided the first evidence that miRNA-133b may directly target matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) in RCC. The present study also provided evidence that miRNA-133b suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting MMP-9 in RCC cell lines. These results suggested that miRNA-133b may be used for the development of novel molecular markers and therapeutic approaches to inhibit the metastasis of RCC.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Male
