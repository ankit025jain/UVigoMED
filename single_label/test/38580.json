{"id":38580,"title":"Outcomes in patients with esotropic duane retraction syndrome and a partially accommodative component.","abstract":"The management of Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is challenging and may become more difficult if an associated accommodative component due to high hyperopia is present. The purpose of this study is to review clinical features and outcomes in patients with partially accommodative esotropia and DRS.Retrospective, non-comparative case series.Six cases of DRS with high hyperopia were reviewed.Of the patients studied, the mean age of presentation was 1.3 years (range: 0.5-2.5 years). The mean amount of hyperopia was + 5D (range: 3.50-8.50) in both eyes. The mean follow up period was 7 years (range: 4 months-12 years). Five cases were unilateral while one was bilateral. Four cases underwent vertical rectus muscle transposition (VRT) and one had medial rectus recession prior to presentation; all were given optical correction. Two (50%) of the four patients who underwent vertical rectus transposition cases developed consecutive exotropia, one of whom did not have spectacles prescribed pre-operatively. All other cases (four) had minimal residual esotropia and face turn at the last follow-up with spectacle correction.Patients with Duane syndrome can have an accommodative component to their esotropia, which is crucial to detect and correct prior to surgery to decrease the risk of long-term over-correction. Occasionally, torticollis in Duane syndrome can be satisfactorily corrected with spectacles alone.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413823","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.568006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Hyperopia","weight":0.352778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia"},{"name":"Duane syndrome","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_syndrome"},{"name":"Exotropia","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotropia"},{"name":"Esotropia","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotropia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Torticollis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torticollis"},{"name":"Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaamse_Radio-_en_Televisieomroep"},{"name":"Medial rectus muscle","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Face (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Accommodation reflex","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_reflex"},{"name":"Muscles of orbit","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscles_of_orbit"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"}]}
