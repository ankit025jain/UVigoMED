{"id":63387,"title":"[News in hodgkin lymphoma therapy].","abstract":"Hodgkin lymphoma is a well-known clinico-pathological entity with a stable incidence among time accounting for 1200 new cases each year in France. The disease is one of the most curable cancer and occurs often in young patients with a median age at 33 years, the major clinical symptoms are lymph nodes mostly above the diaphragm (mediastinal and supra-clavicular). The diagnosis should be suggested with non-specific symptoms such as fever, night sweats, pruritus, weight-loss, lymph node, cough.. leading to prescribe routine exams like blood test with leucocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and chest Xray. Treatments always include chemotherapy and radiotherapy in localized disease and at a low dose only in involved fields. The usually good prognostic of Hodgkin lymphoma may not let us forget that there are still deaths in patients with refractory or early relapse of the disease. There is still an unmet need is these patients and the search for new drugs is essential.
