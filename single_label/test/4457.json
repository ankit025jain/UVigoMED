{"id":4457,"title":"[Dynamics of structural change of ovarian tissue under ischemia].","abstract":"In this work it was investigated the dependence of the correlation of folliculogenesis and endocrine function of ovarian tissue on the degree of structural damage and oocyte volume changes during ischemia. It was shown that after 2 hours of ischemia at 37 °C the morphological transformation of the structural components of the ovarian tissue were reversible. In case of restoration of blood flow conditions by heterotopic transplantation estradiol level of animals was 25,9 ± 5,18 pg/ml, progesterone--18,48 ± 3,69 ng/ml, significantly higher than the castrated animals-recipients. Supplement of the incubation medium by the fetal bovine serum lead to decreasing by 5-7% in the volume of oocytes of growing follicles during in ischemia and reduced steroidogenic function of ovarian tissue after perfusion. Increased time of the ischemia up to 4 hours was founded in irreversible morphological transformation, reduce the volume of oocytes by 40% and the formation of sclerosed tissue after transplantation of the ischemic fragments of ovarian tissue.","date":"2015-01-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566675","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Folliculogenesis","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folliculogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.55342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.374546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.186274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.10801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Fetal bovine serum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"}]}
