{"id":8548,"title":"The biomechanical effects of polytetrafluoroethylene suture augmentations in lateral-row rotator cuff repairs in an ovine model.","abstract":"This study investigated the biomechanical effects of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) suture augmentation patches in rotator cuff repair constructs.The infraspinatus tendon in 24 cadaveric ovine shoulders was repaired using an inverted horizontal mattress suture with 2 knotless bone anchors (ArthroCare, Austin, TX, USA) in a lateral-row configuration. Four different repair groups (6 per group) were created: (1) standard repair using inverted horizontal mattress sutures, (2) repair with ePTFE suture augmentations on the bursal side of the tendon, (3) repair with ePTFE suture augmentations on the articular side, and, (4) repair with ePTFE suture augmentations on both sides of the tendon. Footprint contact pressure, stiffness, and the load to failure of the repair constructs were measured.Repairs with ePTFE suture augmentations on the bursal side exerted significantly more footprint contact pressure (0.40 ± 0.01 MPa) than those on the articular side (0.34 ± 0.02 MPa, P = .04) and those on both sides (0.33 ± 0.02 MPa, P = .01). At 15 degrees of abduction, ePTFE-augmented repairs on the bursal side had higher footprint contact pressure (0.26 ± 0.03 MPa) compared with standard repairs (0.15 ± 0.02 MPa, P = .01) and with ePTFE-augmented repairs on the articular side (0.18 ± 0.02 MPa, P = .03). The ePTFE-augmented repairs on the bursal side demonstrated significantly higher failure loads (178 ± 18 N) than standard repairs (120 ± 17 N, P = .04).Inverted horizontal mattress sutures augmented with ePTFE patches on the bursal side of the tendon enhanced footprint contact pressures and the ultimate load to failure of lateral-row rotator cuff repairs in an ovine model.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766792","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.814258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.671355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.459549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.380448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.316152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.186004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Texas","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"},{"name":"Structural failure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_failure"},{"name":"Infraspinatus muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infraspinatus_muscle"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Austin, Texas","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas"},{"name":"Synovial bursa","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_bursa"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Professional wrestling holds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Augmentation of honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_of_honour"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Footprint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Mattress","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattress"}]}
