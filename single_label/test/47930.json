{"id":47930,"title":"Short-term surgical and long-term survival outcomes after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.","abstract":"Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) for gastric cancer has gradually gained popularity. However, the long-term oncological outcomes of LDG have rarely been reported. This study aimed to investigate the survival outcomes of LDG, and evaluate the early surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) and totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG).Clinical outcomes of 240 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent LDG at our institution between October 2004 and April 2013 were analyzed. Early surgical outcomes of LADG and TLDG were compared and operative experiences were evaluated.Of the 240 patients, 93 underwent LADG and 147 underwent TLDG. There were 109 T1, 36 T2, 31 T3, and 64 T4a lesions. The median follow-up period was 31.5 months (range: 4-106 months). Tumor recurrence was observed in 40 patients and peritoneal recurrence was observed most commonly. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates according to tumor stage were 90.3% and 93.1% in stage I, 72.7% and 67.6% in stage II, and 34.8% and 41.5% in stage III, respectively. No significant differences in early surgical outcomes were noted such as operation time, blood loss and postoperative recovery between LADG and TLDG (P >0.05).LDG for gastric cancer had acceptable long-term oncologic outcomes. The early surgical outcomes of the two commonly used LDG methods were similar.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568165","annotations":[{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.765431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.471689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.318934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0585634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"}]}
