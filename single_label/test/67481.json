{"id":67481,"title":"Long-term functional outcome of percutaneous nephrolithotomy in solitary kidney.","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term functional outcome of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) for calculi in solitary kidneys and to determine factors leading to renal function deterioration.The computerized files of patients with solitary kidneys who underwent PNL between January 2002 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with follow-up <2 years were excluded. Complications, secondary procedures, and stone-free rates were recorded. Changes in the renal function were judged by comparing preoperative and postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rates. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors that may affect renal function were tested using univariate and multivariate analyses to define risk factors for deterioration of renal function on long-term follow-up.The study included 200 patients (133 men [66.5%] and 67 women [33.5%] with mean age 52.3 ± 11.7 years). Complications were reported in 34 patients (17%). Severe bleeding was noticed in 10 patients (5%). The overall stone-free rate was 89.5%. After a mean follow-up of 3 ± 1.4 years (range, 2-8), there was significant improvement of the estimated glomerular filtration rate from 57 to 64 mL/min (P <.001). Thirty-one patients (15.5%) showed deterioration of the renal function. Multiple punctures and postoperative bleeding were independent risk factors for renal function deterioration (odds ratio was 3.7 and 4.5, respectively).PNL for calculi in solitary kidneys provided significant improvement in renal function at long-term follow-up. Multiple punctures and severe bleeding are independent risk factors for deterioration of the kidney function.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612617","annotations":[{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.779629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.4191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_nephrolithotomy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"National Liberal Party (Romania)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(Romania)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
