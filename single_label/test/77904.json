{"id":77904,"title":"Deep insertion - round window approach by using SRA electrode.","abstract":"Hearing preservation surgery requires specially a traumatic technique. Having some preoperative anatomical data of the size of patient's cochlea surgeon can design his or her insertion depth. In the study we have evaluated a relation between hearing preservation rate and angular insertion depth estimated intraoperatively and postoperatively having measured insertion angle from radiological assessment and calculations given by Escude. There has not been no statistically significant difference between insertion depth angle, either estimated intraoperatively and measured and calculated post-operatively, and hearing preservation rate in the group. This analysis confirms a traumaticy of insertion in hearing preservation surgery.
