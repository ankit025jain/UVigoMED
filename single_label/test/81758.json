{"id":81758,"title":"Cytokine gene polymorphisms associate with microbiogical agents in periodontal disease: our experience.","abstract":"Periodontics has evolved from a simplistic model to a more complex interplay between infection and host response. Genetic factors have been a new addition to the list of risk factors for periodontal diseases. The processes leading to destruction and regeneration of the destroyed tissues are of great interest to both researchers and clinicians. The selective susceptibility of subjects for periodontitis has remained an enigma and wide varieties of risk factors have been implicated for the manifestation and progression of periodontitis. Emerging pathway models suggest that gene-environment interactions are etiologically important in disease pathogenesis. The current practical utility of genetic knowledge in periodontitis is limited. Allelic variants at multiple gene loci probably influence periodontitis susceptibility. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a key modulator of host responses to microbial infection and a major modulator of extracellular matrix catabolism and bone resorption, and polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster have been associated with an increased risk of developing severe adult periodontitis. The aim of this study was to test if polymorphisms of genes of IL-1?(+4845) and IL-1?(+3954) were linked with periodontitis, in a case-control study population, delimited to a specific geographic area, in association with microbiological findings. The polymorphisms observed in IL-1?(+4845) and IL-1?(+3954) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was significantly different among the study groups (healthy controls, mild, moderate and severe periodontitis with p<0.05, d.f.=1. We found a significant correlation between the severe form of periodontitis and the presence of composite genotype (p < 0.05, d.f.=1, calculated among healthy vs. severe). Furthermore a statistically significant association between the presence of bacteria and periodontitis was detected (p<0.05, d.f.=1). In the current investigation findings were concordant with literature observations.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic
