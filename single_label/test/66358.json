{"id":66358,"title":"Plasma adiponectin levels for prediction of cardiovascular risk among hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"Adiponectin (ADPN) is an endogenous insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory hormone, released by the adipose tissue. We investigated the clinical and biochemical correlates of plasma ADPN levels and the predictive value of ADPN with respect to survival rates and cardiovascular (CV) events was tested prospectively in a cohort of hemodialysis (HD) patients. We measured baseline ADPN in 110 HD patients, in addition to, 34 healthy subjects to serve as reference group. ADPN levels, were related to different clinical and biochemical cardiovascular risk factors such as increased body mass index (BMI), serum triglycerides (TG), duration of HD, smoking, mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), high density (HDL) cholesterol, low density (LDL) cholesterol, serum glucose, hemoglobulin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in HD patients. Plasma ADPN levels were higher (P?=?0.000) among HD patients (15.06?±?3.54??g/mL) than among reference subjects (6.52?±?1.07??g/mL), were independent of age, and higher among women (16.13?±?3.09??g/mL) than among men (13.94?±?3.65??g/mL). Plasma ADPN levels were inversely related to BMI, TG, CRP and glucose levels. Furthermore, plasma ADPN levels were directly related to HDL-cholesterol and Kt/V. Plasma ADPN levels were lower (P?=?0.000) among patients who experienced new CV events (11.13?±?2.15??g/mL) than among event-free patients (16.82?±?2.45??g/mL), and seem to predict cardiovascular outcomes. The inverse relationships between ADPN and several cardiovascular risk factors indicate that ADPN may have a protective role in the prevention of CV events.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male
