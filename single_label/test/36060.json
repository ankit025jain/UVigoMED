{"id":36060,"title":"Premonitory urges and repetitive behaviours in adult patients with Tourette syndrome.","abstract":"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by multiple motor and phonic tics, which are associated with sensory symptoms (premonitory urges). Little is known about the nature of the subjective urges and repetitive behaviours which are intrinsic to TS. This study assessed the relationship between specific urges and repetitive behaviours in 108 consecutive adult patients recruited at a specialist TS Clinic. Analysis of self-report measures of sensory symptoms (Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale) and repetitive behaviours (Motor tic, Obsessions and compulsions, Vocal tic Evaluation Survey) showed that different types of urges are associated with simple/complex tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
