{"id":70983,"title":"Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in diagnosis of benign and malignant breast lesions.","abstract":"This study aims to investigate the value of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US) in differentiating benign and malignant breast lumps.Patients with breast lesions were observed. The enhancement form, intensity, and time-intensity curve were classified, and the characteristics of all the lesions were analyzed.Inhomogeneous partial enhancement and entire enhancement were exhibited in most of the malignant lesions. High enhancements were observed in malignant lesions, whereas lower enhancement and no enhancement were exhibited in the benign tumors. The peak value and regression time were significantly different between the two groups.There's a significant difference regarding the results of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound between the benign tumor and malignant tumor which would help to improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast neoplasms.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118483","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.615836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.524967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
