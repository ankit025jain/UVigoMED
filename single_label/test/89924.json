{"id":89924,"title":"MDCT of renal trauma: correlation to AAST organ injury scale.","abstract":"Renal injuries affect 8-10% of patients presenting with blunt abdominal trauma. Imaging with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is the preferred modality at most trauma centers. Renal injuries have been categorized by several grading schemes in the literature. The classification proposed by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) predicts clinical outcome with reasonable accuracy. Although the AAST classification for renal injury is primarily based on findings during surgery, it has a strong correlation with MDCT findings.
