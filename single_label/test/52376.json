{"id":52376,"title":"Low-activity (124)I-PET/low-dose CT versus (131)I probe measurements in pretherapy assessment of radioiodine uptake in benign thyroid diseases.","abstract":"Radioiodine therapy of benign thyroid diseases requires pretherapy assessment of radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) for reliable therapy planning.Our objective was to assess RAIU by low-activity (124)I-positron emission tomography/low-dose computed tomography ((124)I-PET/CT) in comparison with standard (131)I probe measurements.This prospective comparative study was conducted at the Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany, in a referral center setting.A total of 79 patients with benign thyroid diseases were screened, 40 of whom met the inclusion criteria (stable TSH, free T3 and free T4 levels; no thyroid-specific medication, no iodine contamination) and 24 of whom agreed to participate by signing an informed consent.All patients received the standard (131)I scintillation probe uptake test 30 hours after administration of 3 MBq (131)I. Seven days later, all patients were subjected to (124)I-PET/CT uptake measurement 30 hours after administration of 1 MBq (124)I.The decay-corrected uptake values of both techniques were compared. Additionally, 3 different volume-of-interest-based evaluation methods in PET/CT (whole neck [WN], automatic isocontour [IC], and manually contoured [MC]) were evaluated.The (131)I probe measurement and (124)I-PET.WN method provided very similar mean RAIU (30.7% ± 10.3%; 31.7% ± 8.9%), resulting in a significant positive correlation (r = 0.93, P < .001). Compared with (124)I-PET.WN, the (124)I-PET.IC (29.8% ± 8.6%) and the (124)I-PET.MC (24.5% ± 7.1%) demonstrated lower uptake values.Using activities as low as 1 MBq, the (124)I-PET.WN method shows a good correlation with conventional (131)I probe measurement. Thus, (124)I-PET/CT is a suitable alternative for pretherapy RAIU evaluations. This may offer potential additional benefits such as PET/ultrasound fusion imaging and CT volumetry.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Endocrine System
