{"id":78755,"title":"Long-term prognosis for hearing recovery in stroke patients presenting vertigo and acute hearing loss.","abstract":"Vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke (VBIS) can cause acute hearing loss (AHL) because the vertebrobasilar system supplies most of the auditory system including the inner ear. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term prognosis of AHL associated with VBIS.Over 12.5 years, 62 patients with AHL of a vascular cause who were followed for at least 1 year (mean, 49.2 months; SD, 24.4 months) were enrolled in this study. Quantitative audiovestibular function testing was performed during the acute (mostly within 10 days after symptom onset) and last follow-up periods in all patients.On the last follow-up, approximately 65% (39/62) of the patients showed a partial (n=24) or complete (n=15) hearing recovery. All but 2 (97%) patients had acute vertigo and 56 (56/62, 90%) had a unilateral canal paresis to caloric stimulation on the side of the AHL. The most commonly infarcted territory on brain MRI was in the distribution of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (55/62, 89%). Multivariable analysis showed that multiple risk factors for stroke [odds ratio (OR) 10.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 13.7, p=0.011] and profound hearing loss [OR 3.92, 95% CI 1.03 to 14.97, p<0.046] predicted a poor outcome for recovery of hearing loss.Acute hearing loss associated with posterior circulation ischemic stroke exhibits a relatively good long-term outcome. Two or more risk factors for stroke and profound hearing loss are adverse prognostic factors for recovery of hearing loss of a vascular cause.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581671","annotations":[{"name":"Paresis","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresis"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.801751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Basilar artery","weight":0.61561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilar_artery"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.586554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.584672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.486076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.444567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.112892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Anterior inferior cerebellar artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_inferior_cerebellar_artery"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
