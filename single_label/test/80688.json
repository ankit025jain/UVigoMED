{"id":80688,"title":"A novel approach to control brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus using sustained release poly-?-caprolactone-pheromone microspheres.","abstract":"Control of brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus was attempted by utilizing sustained release preparations of synthetic analogues of assembly pheromones. The assembly pheromone, in defined ratio, was encapsulated using poly-?-caprolactone by water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. In the in vitro bioassay, percent mortality with test microspheres was 95.6, 64 and 44 among the unfed larvae, unfed nymph and unfed adults respectively, 24 hours post-exposure. Field trials were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of microspheres in luring and killing environmental stages of R. sanguineus in dog houses/kennels. Engorged and unfed stages in the environment were found adhered and dead on the specially designed lure.
