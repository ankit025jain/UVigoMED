{"id":72462,"title":"Efficacy of six month neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients--a phase II trial.","abstract":"Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) is playing an increasing role in the clinical management of breast cancer (BC) and may improve surgical outcomes for postmenopausal, oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC patients. However, there is currently no consensus on the optimal duration of NHT before surgery. Here, we present the outcomes of the TEAM IIA trial, a multicentre, phase II trial investigating the efficacy of six months of neoadjuvant exemestane in postmenopausal, strong ER-positive (ER+, ?50%) BC patients.102 patients (stage T2-T4ac) were included in the study after exclusion of ineligible patients. Primary end-point was clinical response at 3 and 6 months as measured by palpation. Secondary end-point was radiological response as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography and/or ultrasound. Linear mixed models (95% confidence interval (CI)) were used to compare changes in mean tumour size (in mm) between baseline, 3 and 6 months after the start of endocrine therapy. Conversion rates from mastectomy to breast conserving surgery (BCS) were evaluated.Median age of all patients was 72 years (range 53-88). Overall response rate by clinical palpation was 64.5% in all patients with a final palpation measurement. Four patients had clinically progressive disease. 63 patients had both 3-month and >3-month palpation measurements. Overall response was 58.7% at 3 months and 68.3% at final palpation (>3 months). Mean tumour size by clinical palpation at T=0 was 39.1mm (95% CI 34.8-43.4mm), and decreased to 23.0mm (95% CI 18.7-27.2mm) and 16.7 mm (95% CI 12.6-20.8) at T=3 and T>3 months, respectively (p=0.001). Final radiological response rates at the end of treatment for MRI (n=37), ultrasound (n=77) and mammography (n=56) were 70.3%, 41.6% and 48.2%, respectively. Feasibility of BCS improved from 61.8% to 70.6% (McNemar p=0.012).6 months of neoadjuvant exemestane therapy helps reduce mean tumour size further in strongly ER-positive BC patients without significant side-effects compared to 3 months. Nevertheless, some patients still experience disease progression under exemestane. Feasibility of breast conservation rates improved by almost 10%.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970786","annotations":[{"name":"Exemestane","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exemestane"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.817794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hormonal therapy (oncology)","weight":0.762792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_therapy_(oncology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.531033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.512295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.446255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Postmenopausal","weight":0.426168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmenopausal"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.383389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.284808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.265311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.158269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"ER (TV series)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
