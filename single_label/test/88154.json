{"id":88154,"title":"The Unified Classification System (UCS): improving our understanding of periprosthetic fractures.","abstract":"Periprosthetic fractures are an increasingly common complication following joint replacement. The principles which underpin their evaluation and treatment are common across the musculoskeletal system. The Unified Classification System proposes a rational approach to treatment, regardless of the bone that is broken or the joint involved.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891568","annotations":[{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.67052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.565778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.515767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.509956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.15852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Underpinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpinning"},{"name":"Universal Character Set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set"},{"name":"Unified Wine & Grape Symposium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Wine_&_Grape_Symposium"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"}]}
