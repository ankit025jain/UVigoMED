{"id":56057,"title":"Optical coherence tomography combined with videokeratography to differentiate mild keratoconus subtypes.","abstract":"To develop parameters using a combination of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and videokeratography to detect early keratoconus.Videokeratography, wavefront analysis, and measured OCT indices were performed on 180 normal eyes, 46 eyes with moderate keratoconus, 54 eyes with early keratoconus, 7 eyes with forme fruste keratoconus, and 16 eyes with keratoconus \"suspect\" to determine the most sensitive parameters for separating these groups.A combination of videokeratography and OCT indices (inferior-superior [I-S] value and minimum pachymetry) was statistically the most significant in separating the keratoconus groups from normal eyes (P < .001). Using a newly derived index, the minimum pachymetry divided by the I-S value (pachymetry/asymmetry [PA]/I-S index) with a cut-off of 100, 100% of early and forme fruste keratoconus could be identified as being abnormal with 7 normals misclassified (misclassification rate 2.7%). By adding keratoconus \"suspect\" to the analysis and an I-S value of 1.2 as a cut-off point, 5 \"suspects\" were classified as normal and 11 normals as abnormal (misclassification rate 7.8%). The PA/I-S index, with a cut-off point of 100, reduced this misclassification rate to 4.4%.These results suggest that OCT combined with videokeratography may be more useful for differentiating mild forms of keratoconus than videokeratography alone.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763472","annotations":[{"name":"Optics","weight":0.732144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Forme fruste","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forme_fruste"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Cutoff frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency"},{"name":"Suspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect"},{"name":"Unclassified language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclassified_language"},{"name":"Index (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome"},{"name":"Forme","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forme"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Index of a subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_a_subgroup"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Corneal pachymetry","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_pachymetry"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"}]}
