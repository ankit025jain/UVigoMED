{"id":29972,"title":"Integrated smoking cessation and binge drinking intervention for young adults: a pilot efficacy trial.","abstract":"Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with cigarette smoking in young adults. The primary aim of this investigation was to complete a pilot evaluation of the efficacy of an integrated intervention that targets both cigarette smoking and binge drinking on the cigarette smoking and binge behavior of young adults at 6-month follow-up. Participants were 95 young adult (M=24.3; SD=3.5 years) smokers (?1 cigarettes per day) who binge drink (?1 time per month) and who were randomly assigned to standard treatment (n=47) involving six individual treatment visits plus eight weeks of nicotine patch therapy or the identical smoking cessation treatment integrated with a binge drinking intervention (integrated intervention; n=48). Using an intent-to-treat analysis for tobacco abstinence, at both 3 month end of treatment and 6 month follow-up, more participants who received integrated intervention were biochemically confirmed abstinent from tobacco than those who received standard treatment at 3 months (19% vs. 9%, p=0.06) and 6 months (21% vs. 9%, p=0.05). At 6 months, participants who completed the study and who received integrated intervention consumed fewer drinks per month (p<0.05) and number of binge drinking episodes per month (p<0.05) than those who received standard treatment. Preliminary data supports that integrated intervention enhances smoking cessation and reduces binge drinking compared to standard treatment.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583274","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotine patch","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_patch"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.597689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Binge drinking","weight":0.56192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_drinking"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.419783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.357338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Transdermal patch","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal_patch"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Young-adult fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young-adult_fiction"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"List of countries by alcohol consumption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"}]}
