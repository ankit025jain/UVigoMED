{"id":15748,"title":"A bundle strategy including patient hand hygiene to decrease clostridium difficile infections.","abstract":"Prevention strategies for Clostridium difficile infection traditionally have addressed barrier precautions, environmental disinfection, and health care worker hand hygiene. When applied as a bundle, this approach has been used widely as an evidence-based strategy to prevent hospital-acquired C. difficile infection. Expanding the bundle to include patient hand hygiene is a nurse-driven approach to prevent C. difficile transmission.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137788","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.55,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.508649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.464437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Hand washing","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"}]}
