{"id":29857,"title":"Post-mortem whole body computed tomography of opioid (heroin and methadone) fatalities: frequent findings and comparison to autopsy.","abstract":"To investigate frequent findings in cases of fatal opioid intoxication in whole-body post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT).PMCT of 55 cases in which heroin and/or methadone had been found responsible for death were retrospectively evaluated (study group), and were compared with PMCT images of an age- and sex-matched control group. Imaging results were compared with conventional autopsy.The most common findings in the study group were: pulmonary oedema (95 %), aspiration (66 %), distended urinary bladder (42 %), cerebral oedema (49 %), pulmonary emphysema (38 %) and fatty liver disease (36 %). These PMCT findings occurred significantly more often in the study group than in the control group (p?<?0.05). The combination of lung oedema, brain oedema and distended urinary bladder was seen in 26 % of the cases in the study group but never in the control group (0 %). This triad, as indicator of opioid-related deaths, had a specificity of 100 %, as confirmed by autopsy and toxicological analysis.Frequent findings in cases of fatal opioid intoxication were demonstrated. The triad of brain oedema, lung oedema and a distended urinary bladder on PMCT was highly specific for drug-associated cases of death.Frequent findings in cases of fatal opioid intoxication were investigated. Lung oedema, brain oedema and full urinary bladder represent a highly specific constellation. This combination of findings in post-mortem CT should raise suspicion of intoxication.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599624","annotations":[{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cerebral edema","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.59426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.593778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Methadone","weight":0.570105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.469582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.448388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.189064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.104118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"}]}
