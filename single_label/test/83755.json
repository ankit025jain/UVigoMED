{"id":83755,"title":"Impact of crural relaxing incisions, Collis gastroplasty, and non-cross-linked human dermal mesh crural reinforcement on early hiatal hernia recurrence rates.","abstract":"Hernia recurrence is the leading form of failure after antireflux surgery and may be secondary to unrecognized tension on the crural repair or from a foreshortened esophagus. Mesh reinforcement has proven beneficial for repair of hernias at other sites, but the use of mesh at the hiatus remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of hiatal hernia repair with human dermal mesh reinforcement of the crural closure in combination with tension reduction techniques when necessary.We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who had hiatal hernia repair using AlloMax Surgical Graft (Davol), a human dermal biologic mesh. Objective follow-up was with videoesophagram and/or upper endoscopy at 3 months postoperatively and annually.There were 82 patients with a median age of 63 years. The majority of operations (85%) were laparoscopic primary repairs of a paraesophageal hernia with a fundoplication. The crura were closed primarily in all patients and reinforced with an AlloMax Surgical Graft. A crural relaxing incision was used in 12% and a Collis gastroplasty in 28% of patients. There was no mesh-related morbidity and no mortality. Median objective follow-up was 5 months, but 15 patients had follow-up at 1 or more years. A recurrent hernia was found in 3 patients (4%).Tension-reducing techniques in combination with human biologic mesh crural reinforcement provide excellent early results with no mesh-related complications. Long-term follow-up will define the role of these techniques and this biologic mesh for hiatal hernia repair.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25256373","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.801314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.594376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.504838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.473132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.371385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.370618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.114133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Hiatus hernia","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_hernia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hernia repair","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia_repair"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Objective (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics)"},{"name":"Diplomatic recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Foreshortening","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshortening"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
