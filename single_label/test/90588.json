{"id":90588,"title":"[The possibilities of using a chitin and chitosan in wounds treatment].","abstract":"Chitin and chitosan are natural polysaccharides. In this study, we presented the possibilities of using chitin and chitosan in medical practice and experimental studies. Chitin and chitosan, based wound dressings available as commercial products, were presented. The directions of future progress in employment chitin and chitosan in treatment of many kinds of wounds were also described. In this study, the main properties of these polymers were established. The usefulness of the chitin and chitosan as hemostatic products, wound dressing and skin substitutes was emphasized.
