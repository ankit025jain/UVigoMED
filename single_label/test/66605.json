{"id":66605,"title":"Screening for decreased glomerular filtration rate and associated risk factors in a cohort of HIV-infected patients in a middle-income country.","abstract":"With the introduction of combined active antiretroviral therapy and the improved survival of HIV-infected patients, degenerative diseases and drug toxicity have emerged as long-term concerns. We studied the prevalence of decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and associated risk factors in a cohort of HIV-infected patients from a middle-income country. Our cross-sectional study included all adult patients who attended an urban outpatient clinic in 2008. GFR was estimated using the CKD-EPI equation. The prevalence ratio (PR) of decreased GFR (defined as <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was estimated using generalizing linear models assuming a Poisson distribution. We analyzed data from 1,970 patients, of which 82.9% had been exposed to ART. A total of 249 patients (12.6%) had a GFR between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 3.1% had a GFR between 30 and 59, 0.3% had a GFR between 15 and 29, and 0.4% had a GFR <15. Decreased GFR was found in only 74 patients (3.8%). In the multivariate regression model, the factors that were independently associated with a GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were as follows: age ? 50 years (PR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.7-6.8), diabetes (PR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4), hypertension (PR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.2), current CD4+ cell count <350 cells/mm3 (PR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3-3.3), past exposure to tenofovir (PR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.3-9.4) and past exposure to indinavir (PR =1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.8). As in high-income countries, CKD was the predominant form of kidney involvement among HIV-infected individuals in our setting. The risk factors associated with decreased glomerular filtration were broad and included virus-related factors as well as degenerative and nephrotoxic factors. Despite the potential for nephrotoxicity associated with some antiretroviral drugs, in the short-term, advanced chronic renal disease remains very rare.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699873","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Indinavir","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indinavir"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.700841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.698266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.649073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.495506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tenofovir","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.179268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"}]}
