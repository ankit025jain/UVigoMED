{"id":78599,"title":"[The clinic analysis of 47 cases with endoscopic maxillary sinus surgery by lateral wall fenestration of the inferior nasal meatus].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of the endoscopic maxillary sinus surgery by lateral wall fenestration of the inferior nasal meatus (EMSLWF).Based on traditional Messerklinger sinus surgery, we treat the 17 cases with maxillary sinus disorder by lateral wall fenestration of the inferior nasal meatus, removing the polyp, hemangioma, inverting papilloma, invasive sinus aspergillosis etc, trans aperture maxillary and intranasal window.The maxillary sinuses of the 17 cases are clean. Mucosa are well recovered and drained of the mid dle and inferior nasal meatus. We did not find the nasal mucosa pathological changes like the fluid-filled blisters or edema etc. The intranasal windows are closed in only 2 cases (4.25%) after about 2 months. The maxillary sinuses of all cases are still clean with no recurrence of primary diseases.The EMSLWF is well suitable for dealing with the maxillary sinus diseases. Meanwhile, before the function of the nasal mucociliary transportation system recovered in the perioperative period, the gravity drainage affection should be kept by the intranasal win dow in the inferior nasal meatus. The EMSLWF is worthy of more attention in clinic.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620663","annotations":[{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.783233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.706451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.682628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.5989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.517761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.245853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Inferior nasal meatus","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_nasal_meatus"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aspergillosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillosis"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Gravitation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation"},{"name":"Blister","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Urinary meatus","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_meatus"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"}]}
