{"id":20960,"title":"Different paths to pathogenesis.","abstract":"In a recent issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Elsen and colleagues identify a novel hemolysin in a highly virulent Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that lacks a type III secretion system. Their analysis provides another example of how individual strains of P. aeruginosa utilize different virulence mechanisms to cause severe infections.
