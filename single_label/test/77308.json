{"id":77308,"title":"[Barrier creams in prevention of hand dermatoses].","abstract":"Contact dermatitis is a common skin disease in the workplace and at home. Due to the high incidence of skin diseases the European Union countries have taken the activity to reduce or minimize this problem by the promotion of skin protection program, based on the application of skin protection measures - barrier creams and moisturizers. Definitions, reasons, mechanism of action and duration, application of methods, as well as the efficacy of using skin protection products in different workplaces are extensively reviewed in this article. Correctly matched barrier preparations protect against harmful factors and irritants, facilitating at the same time hand washing at the end of the working day, and together with the use of suitable non-irritating detergents and skin care products are important elements contributing to the prevention of occupational skin diseases. They shouldn't be used as a primary protection against high-risk substances. Numerous creams declared as the skin protection measures are on the market, so a careful selection of appropriate effective skin protecting barrier cream for the specific situations/environments is recommended.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090859","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Moisturizer","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.732141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.724329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.641111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.623267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Detergent","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent"},{"name":"Cream (pharmaceutical)","weight":0.567506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(pharmaceutical)"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.47144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.314635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Hand washing","weight":0.305469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Barrier cream","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_cream"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Washing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Working time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Division of Barrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Barrier"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Definitions (How I Met Your Mother)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother)"}]}
