{"id":22343,"title":"Recurrence of acute appendicitis after non-operative treatment of appendiceal abscess in children: a single-centre experience.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of recurrence of acute appendicitis after initial successful non-operative treatment of appendiceal abscess in children.This study was an observational cohort study of children treated non-operatively for appendiceal abscess at a large tertiary referral centre from 2006 to 2010. The primary outcome was recurrence of acute appendicitis. Secondary outcome variables were re-admission and interval appendectomy.Eighty-nine patients were discharged after successful non-operative treatment of appendiceal abscess. The median age was 10.1 (1.3-16.3) years. Nine patients underwent surgery during the follow-up period. Five patients were re-admitted with ongoing symptoms leading to an appendectomy. They all returned shortly after discharge and are considered failures of initial treatment. Two of 82 patients returned with a new episode of acute appendicitis during the trial period. Hence, the recurrence rate was 2.4 % during 5.1 years of follow-up.Our data support the strategy of not performing an interval appendectomy after successful non-operative treatment with antibiotics of an appendiceal abscess in children.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557154","annotations":[{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Appendicitis","weight":0.330556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.143912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.10821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Appendectomy","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stewie Kills Lois/Lois Kills Stewie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewie_Kills_Lois/Lois_Kills_Stewie"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
