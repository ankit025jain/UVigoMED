{"id":38756,"title":"Long-term clinical experience with Amplatzer Ductal Occluder II for closure of the persistent arterial duct in children.","abstract":"To describe the long-term clinical experience and follow-up with the Amplatzer Ductal Occluder II (ADO II) in children.All patients undergoing attempted transcatheter closure of patent arterial duct (PDA) with the ADO II were included. Data collected included demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic parameters.From March 2008 until March 2013, 62 patients with a median age of 1.2 years (range 0.43-11.1 years) and median weight of 9 kg (range 4.7-31.4 kg) underwent the procedure. The median measurement for minimal ductal diameter was 2.7 mm (range 1.3-5 mm). An ADO II was implanted in 60 patients (96.8%). Two patients had significant residual shunting following deployment of the ADO II and underwent closure with the Amplatzer ductal occluder I (ADO I) during the same procedure. In six patients, the initial ADO II was unsatisfactory, and after recapture a different size ADO II was deployed. Device embolization of the ADO II to the pulmonary artery occurred in 6.7% of patients. Of these, one underwent surgical closure and three were closed with an ADO I. Complete occlusion on echocardiography was noted prior to discharge in 87.5% of the deployed occluders and 100% at first follow-up. Five year follow-up (n = 25) revealed a 100% occlusion rate. There were three cases of persistent mild left pulmonary artery stenosis at long-term follow-up.The ADO II is effective for occlusion of PDA with variable anatomy from either arterial or venous approaches with a low profile delivery system. Stable occluder position is highly dependent on accurate device sizing, good quality imaging to visualize device configuration after deployment and operator experience.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403100","annotations":[{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.660755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.346553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.339283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Personal digital assistant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"},{"name":"35 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film"},{"name":"Left pulmonary artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Sizing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizing"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Boom tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_tube"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"ActiveX Data Objects","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX_Data_Objects"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
