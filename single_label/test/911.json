{"id":911,"title":"[Informed consent: coronary artery bypass grafting].","abstract":"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is well-documented procedure. Despite the increased prevalence of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), surgical revascularization will continue to have a major role in patients with coronary artery disease. As shown in previous clinical studies, physicians can provide important information about risk-adjusted outcomes to patients. A number of databases have been used to develop risk models for predicting morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing CABG. Patients must make a choice between CABG and PCI based on physicians' explanations. Major trials demonstrated a marked survival benefit from CABG among those patients at high risk of death from the disease itself as defined by the severity of angina, number of diseased vessels, and left ventricular function. However, it is not clear that patients always receive the correct information on whether CABG or PCI is the more appropriate procedure. The initial informed consent should be obtained using the relevant guidelines by an independent adviser.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549431","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.837505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.791621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.564624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.443607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.379064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.0737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
