{"id":20931,"title":"Psychosis in neurosyphilis: an association of poor prognosis.","abstract":"The spectrum of neurosyphilis includes asymptomatic patients, those with variable neurologic deficit, and those with complex cognitive, psychotic and mood dysfunction. Although the neurologic symptoms of neurosyphilis can remit with penicillin treatment, the psychiatric symptoms may persist. We identify two neurosyphilis cases characterized by prominent psychoses and describe commonalities that might assist clinicians in identifying neurosyphilis early.
