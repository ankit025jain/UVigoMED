{"id":91587,"title":"[Progress on treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture].","abstract":"Osteoporosis vertebral compression fractures seriously affect the life and health of the elderly,indicating the elderly life health begin to decline. Therefore, aggressive treatment is particularly important. Traditional surgical method,such as laminectomy and internal fixation has large trauma,more blood loss and high failure rate. However, conservative treatment cannot early reduce pain symptoms and improve functional status,it can lead delayed union and severe ossification and form chronic OVCF,make more difficult to treat. In treatment of vertebral body fracture,there was a new way with the development of minimally invasive spinal surgery technology. Percutaneous vertebroplasty and percutaneous kyphoplasty has become the commonly used method in treating OVCF. With rapid and significant analgesic effect,vertebral body height recovered ideally, the patients can early load activities and preoperative complications is rare. Effective rehabilitation exercise is also important in treating OVCF by surgery at the same time.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490543","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.831813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Laminectomy","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminectomy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.630746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.574758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Human height","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Rugby union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
