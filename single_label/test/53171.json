{"id":53171,"title":"Effect of PUFA-rich plant oil on risk factors of STZ-induced diabetes in Wistar rats.","abstract":"This study has been focused on the effect of an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) rich plant oil on oxidation and glycooxidation stress markers as well as on antioxidant enzyme activities in male Wistar rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.The non-diabetic and diabetic groups of Wistar rats were administered plant oil at concentrations of 100 and 500 mg/kg body weight and controls without plant oil. The parameters of glycaemic control, lipid profile, total antioxidant status, antioxidant enzyme activities, together with oxidative and glycooxidative stress markers were measured in the blood.The intake of the plant oil did not significantly influence the parameters of glycaemic control and significantly increased the levels of all lipid profile parameters in the diabetic rats. Plant oil administration significantly decreased the total antioxidant status and glutathione peroxidase activity and the activity of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase was significantly increased. The plant oil also increased the levels of lipoperoxides and advanced the glycation end products.These results suggest that the plant oil with high concentrations of n-6 PUFA - linoleic acid, acts prooxidatively when administered to the rats.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533892","annotations":[{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fatty acid","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Linoleic acid","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Vegetable fats and oils","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_fats_and_oils"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.590028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.389455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.240999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
