{"id":54985,"title":"Elevated transforming growth factor ?1 in plasma of primary open-angle glaucoma patients.","abstract":"To test the hypothesis that primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients have a systemic elevation of transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF?1).Plasma was prepared from blood samples drawn from patients of the Vanderbilt Eye Institute during clinic visits. Concentrations of total TGF?1 and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) in plasma were determined by ELISA. Statistical significance of differences between POAG and control samples was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test. Regression analysis was used to evaluate correlations between plasma TGF?1 and patient age and between plasma TGF?1 and TSP1.Plasma samples were obtained from 148 POAG patients and 150 controls. Concentration of total TGF?1 in the plasma of POAG patients (median = 3.25 ng/mL) was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than in controls (median = 2.46 ng/mL). Plasma TGF?1 was not correlated with age of patient (P = 0.17). Thrombospondin-1 concentration was also significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in POAG patients (median = 0.774 ?g/mL) as compared to controls (median = 0.567 ?g/mL). Plasma total TGF?1 and TSP1 concentrations were linearly correlated (P < 0.0001).Plasma samples from POAG patients display elevated total TGF?1 compared to controls, consistent with elevated systemic TGF?1 in POAG patients.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25061114","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.775591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.436156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.335535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0990064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Thrombospondin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombospondin"},{"name":"Thrombospondin 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombospondin_1"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"774","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"}]}
