{"id":56553,"title":"Ocular pseudoexfoliation syndrome and vascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"Many studies have assessed the association between ocular pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) and vascular disease and produced controversial results. We performed a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies to evaluate this relationship.Eligible studies that reported the incidence of vascular disease among PEX and control groups were identified via computer searches and reviewing the reference lists of the key articles. The summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model. Meta-regression to assess heterogeneity by several covariates and a subgroup analysis on study design and population were performed. Publication bias was tested by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test.Sixteen eligible studies involving 8,533 PEX patients and 135,720 control patients were included in the meta-analysis. All studies were performed primarily in whites with a mean age between 54.7 and 77.1 years. The overall combined ORs for patients with PEX compared with the reference group were 1.72 (95% CI: 1.31 to 2.26) for any vascular disease, 1.61 (95% CI: 1.22 to 2.14) for coronary heart disease, 1.59 (95% CI: 1.12 to 2.23) for cerebrovascular disease, and 2.48 (95% CI: 1.30 to 4.72) for aortic aneurysm. There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity; however, subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed this result to be robust. No evidence of publication bias was observed.The overall current literature suggests that PEX was associated with increased risk of vascular disease. Because of the limitations of the included studies and meta-analysis, the findings need to be confirmed in future research via well-designed cohort studies.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Eye
