{"id":69124,"title":"Infertility service use in the United States: data from the National Survey of Family Growth, 1982-2010.","abstract":"This report presents nationally representative estimates and trends for infertility service use among women aged 15-44 and 25-44 in the United States in 1982-2010. While greater detail on types of infertility service is shown for women, basic data on types of infertility service use, as reported by men aged 25-44, are also presented.Data for this report come primarily from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), consisting of 22,682 interviews with men and women aged 15-44, conducted from June 2006 through June 2010. The response rate for females in the 2006-2010 NSFG was 78%, and for males was 75%. Selected trends are shown based on prior NSFG cycles.Twelve percent of women aged 15-44 in 2006-2010 (7.3 million women), or their husbands or partners, had ever used infertility services. Among women aged 25-44, 17% (6.9 million) had ever used any infertility service, a significant decrease from 20% in 1995. Thirty-eight percent of nulliparous women with current fertility problems in 2006-2010 had ever used infertility services, significantly less than 56% of such women in 1982. In all survey years, ever-use of medical help to get pregnant was highest among older and nulliparous women, non-Hispanic white women, women with current fertility problems, and women with higher levels of education and household income. The most commonly used infertility services among women aged 25-44 in 2006-2010 were advice, testing, medical help to prevent miscarriage, and ovulation drugs. Ever-use of infertility services was reported by 9.4% of men aged 25-44 in 2006-2010, similar to levels seen in 2002.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467919","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.563579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.455287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.246946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.245441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.154457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"1982","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"682","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/682"},{"name":"1544","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1544"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Education in Puerto Rico","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Household income in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"}]}
