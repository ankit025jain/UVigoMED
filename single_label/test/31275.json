{"id":31275,"title":"Etoricoxib: a safe alternative for NSAID intolerance in Asian patients.","abstract":"NSAID intolerance is not uncommon. Etoricoxib, a cox-2 inhibitor NSAID, has been shown to be a safe alternative in these patients. This study aims to determine the rate of NSAID intolerant patients who are able to tolerate etoricoxib without adverse reactions.This study analyzed charts and electronic databases of all patients referred to the allergy clinics of the National University Hospital and Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore from 2006-2011 for oral provocation tests to etoricoxib (cumulative dose of 120 mg), on the background of NSAID intolerance. Demographics, atopic comorbidities, history of chronic urticaria, inciting NSAID, onset and type of reaction, and provocation test outcomes were obtained.A total of 74 patients (mean age 37; range: 16-72 years) underwent provocation tests to etoricoxib. Of these, 59% were female. Majority were Chinese (69%), followed by Malay (12%), Caucasian (8%), Indian (5%) and various other races (6%). Forty-six percent of the study population had atopic comorbidities, and 4% had concomitant chronic urticaria. Eighty percent of patients had a history of intolerance to 1 NSAID, while the rest (20%) had intolerance to multiple NSAIDS. Forty-one percent of patients had concomitant acetaminophen intolerance. Some of the patients had multiple symptoms on presentation, the most common of which were periorbital and facial edema (90%), breathing difficulties (26%) and urticaria (25%), with the onset of reaction occurring mostly within 30 minutes to 1 hour. Etoricoxib was tolerated in 95% of the patients. Subjects who reacted to the challenge all had mild reactions which resolved with antihistamines.Etoricoxib is a safe alternative in NSAID intolerant patients. Nevertheless, it is advised that patients should undergo provocation tests to confirm tolerance.","date":"2014-01-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24383977","annotations":[{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.914495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.729491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.717845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.653507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Histamine antagonist","weight":0.615676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_antagonist"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.457294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.418918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.404782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.39502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.393226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"China","weight":0.246599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.198552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Etoricoxib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoricoxib"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Lactose intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Food intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
