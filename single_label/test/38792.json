{"id":38792,"title":"microRNAs miR-27a and miR-27b directly regulate liver dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase expression through two conserved binding sites.","abstract":"Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, encoded by DPYD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the uracil catabolic pathway and has a pivotal role in the pharmacokinetics of the commonly prescribed anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Deficiency of DPD, whether due to inadequate expression or deleterious variants in DPYD, has been linked to severe toxic responses to 5-FU. Little is known about the mechanisms governing DPD expression in the liver. In this report, we show increased accumulation of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) proteins on DPYD mRNA in cells overexpressing the highly homologous microRNAs (miRNA) miR-27a and miR-27b. These miRNAs were shown to repress DPD expression through two conserved recognition sites in DPYD. The IC50 of 5-FU for HCT116 cells overexpressing miR-27a or miR-27b was 4.4 ?mol/L (both), significantly lower than that for cells expressing a nontargeting (scramble) control miRNA (14.3 ?mol/L; P = 3.3 × 10(-5) and P = 1.5 × 10(-7), respectively). Mouse liver DPD enzyme activity was inversely correlated with expression levels of miR-27a (R(2) = 0.49; P = 0.0012) and miR-27b (R(2) = 0.29; P = 0.022). A common variant in the hairpin loop region of hsa-mir-27a (rs895819) was also shown to be associated with elevated expression of the miR-27a in a panel of cell lines (P = 0.029) and in a transgenic overexpression model (P = 0.0011). Furthermore, rs895819 was associated with reduced DPD enzyme activity (P = 0.028) in a cohort of 40 healthy volunteers. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-27a and miR-27b expression may be pharmacologically relevant modulators of DPD enzyme function in the liver. Furthermore, our data suggest that rs895819 may be a potential risk allele for 5-FU sensitivity.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401318","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.840983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Uracil","weight":0.810318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.550591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.10801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Enzyme activity","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_activity"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Turn (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
