{"id":73175,"title":"Vascularized bone graft for oncological reconstruction of the extremities: review of the biological advantages.","abstract":"Vascularized bone graft (VBG) is a form of vascularized bone marrow transplant in which the bone marrow is surgically grafted with its microenvironment intact. Due to the preservation of cellular viability, VBG have significant advantages over non-vascularized bone grafts. Free vascularized fibula grafts have superior material properties and tolerate infection. Bone healing can be accomplished in a shorter period, even in an irradiated bed. In addition to these properties, VBG has other biological advantages that are not always familiar to oncological surgeons. Hypertrophic change can be divided into reactive and adaptive hypertrophy. Early hypertrophy is associated with donor-derived cells, whereas later remodeling is associated with recipient-derived cells. VBG has significant advantages in enhancing neo-revascularization of necrotic bone. We reviewed VBG from a novel viewpoint that stems from our basic research.
