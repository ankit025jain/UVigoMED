{"id":79349,"title":"[Retinovascular findings in Susac's syndrome].","abstract":"Susac syndrome is a vasculopathy affecting the central nervous system, retina and cochlea leading to the triad encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and hearing loss. To date, about 300 cases have been described in the literature.Three patients with confirmed Susac syndrome were evaluated for disease-specific retinal pathologies. In addition, the overall history of the disease is presented to put the ophthalmological pathology into context.All three cases showed a retinal occlusive microangiopathy with branch retinal artery occlusions. MRI imaging revealed snowball-like lesions of the corpus callosum in two of three cases. At the initial presentation not all criteria of the disease-specific triad encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and hearing loss were fulfilled in the three patients.Interdisciplinary collaboration between neurologists, otorhinolaryngologists and ophthalmologists is mandatory to establish the diagnosis of the disease. The occurrence of the characteristic retinal pathology with small artery occlusions and a segmental vasculopathy should always lead to the differential diagnosis of Susac syndrome.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443136","annotations":[{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Cochlea","weight":0.802289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Corpus callosum","weight":0.745743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.74088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Microangiopathy","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microangiopathy"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.388478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Central retinal artery","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_artery"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
