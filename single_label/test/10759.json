{"id":10759,"title":"Expression of ADAMTs-5 and TIMP-3 in the condylar cartilage of rats induced by experimentally created osteoarthritis.","abstract":"To study the expression of ADAMTs-5 and TIMP-3 in temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) model rats, to explore and confer the possible effects of ADAMTs-5 and TIMP-3 involved in the degradation of the early stage of OA.32 SD rats were divided into four groups: 2-week control group (NC1), 2-week OA group (OA1), 4-week control group (NC2) and 4-week OA group (OA2). Each group had 8 rats. Injection of collagenase was used to build up the TMJOA model. HE staining was used to analyze the structural change of condyle cartilage. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to measure the expression of ADAMTs-5 and TIMP-3 in protein and mRNA levels respectively.HE analysis revealed that no significant changes were observed in NC1, NC2 and OA1 groups, while mild damages appeared in OA2 group. No significant differences were achieved in the expression of ADAMTs-5 in protein levels between NC1 and OA1, but the expression of ADAMTs-5 in 4-week group increased significantly compared to that in the NC2 group. On mRNA level, the expression of ADAMTs-5 in 2-week and 4-week OA groups increased significantly compared to that in the matched control group. Meanwhile, the expression of TIMP-3 decreased significantly, showing a completely different trend.The expression of ADAMTs-5 and TIMP-3 changed significantly in the early stage of TMJOA, which indicated that ADAMTs-5 and TIMP-3 may be play an important part in the initial stage of condylar cartilage degradation.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632095","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.707499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.560512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Collagenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenase"},{"name":"TIMP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMP3"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Network Computer Reference Profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Computer_Reference_Profile"},{"name":"Structural change","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_change"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Condylar canal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condylar_canal"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
