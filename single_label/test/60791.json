{"id":60791,"title":"[Efficacy observation of polyethylene glycol conjugated asparaginase for induction treatment of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia].","abstract":"To observe the efficacy of polyethylene glycol conjugated asparaginase (peg-asp) for induction treatment of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).A total of 268 newly diagnosed children with ALL enrolled in CCLG-2008 from January, 2010 to August, 2012 were analyzed. Patients received either native Escherichia coli asparaginase or pegaspargase along with multiagent chemotherapy during remission induction treatment. Status of bone marrow aspiration was assessed on day 15, day 33 (M1, M2, M3).Of the 268 patients stratified, 37.3% (n = 100) were SR, 32.1% (n = 86) were IR, and 31.6% (n = 82) were HR; 159 patients received native Escherichia coli asparaginase and 109 patients received pegaspargase. Characteristics of two groups in age, sex, blood count at diagnosis, immunophenotype and response to prednisolone had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Bone marrow status on day 15 in pegaspargase group was M1 in 70 (64.2%) cases, M2 in 23 (21.1%) and M3 in 16 (14.7%), while in native Escherichia coli asparaginase group, M1 in 112 (70.4%) cases, M2 in 21 (13.2%) and M3 in 26 (16.4%), respectively (?(2) = 2.938, P = 0.230). Bone marrow status on day 33 was M1 in 105 (96.3%), M2 in 3 (2.8%) and M3 in 1 (0.9%) in pegaspargase group, while it was M1 in 154 (96.9%) cases, M2 in 5 (3.1%) and M3 in native Escherichia coli asparaginase group, respectively (?(2) = 1.494, P = 0.474).Domestic pegaspargase of our country can achieve the similar efficacy in induction treatment for ALL patients as compared with native Escherichia coli asparaginase. The drug could be considered as not only the choice for allergic patients but also a first-line alternative for new patients.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
