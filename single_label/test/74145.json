{"id":74145,"title":"MiRNA-181c inhibits EGFR-signaling-dependent MMP9 activation via suppressing Akt phosphorylation in glioblastoma.","abstract":"As the most aggressive malignant primary human brain tumor, glioblastoma is noted with extremely poor patient survival. Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) in glioblastoma cells is critical for cancer metastasis. However, the molecular signaling pathways that control MMP9 activation remain undefined. Here, we reported a strong negative correlation of microRNA (miRNA)-181c levels with either MMP9 levels or activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in glioblastoma patients. EGF-induced activation of EGFR in a human glioblastoma line, A-172 cells, increased MMP9 expression through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, without affecting expression of miRNA-181c. On the other hand, overexpression of miRNA-181c in A-172 cells inhibited MMP9 expression by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation, but not phosphorylation of EGFR receptor. Taken together, these findings suggest that EGFR signaling activates downstream PI3K/Akt to increase MMP9 expression in glioblastoma, while phosphorylation of Akt is a control point by miRNA-181c. Our work thus provides new insights into the molecular basis underlying the metastasis of glioblastoma.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867100","annotations":[{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.779167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.721848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.704709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.654945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.599432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.350172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.261516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.206518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"}]}
