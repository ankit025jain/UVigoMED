{"id":45076,"title":"Methylation-associated silencing of microRNA-34b in hepatocellular carcinoma cancer.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can act as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes in human cancers including HCC. Previous studies have identified miR-34 family as an important component of the tumor suppressor network during carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the methylation status of miR-34 family in HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The methylation frequencies of miR-34a and miR-34b/c were 72.1% (31/43) and 79.1% (34/43) in HCC tissues, which were significantly higher than that in the adjacent non-tumor tissues (P < 0.05), respectively. The results were validated by bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of miR-34a and miR-34b was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (P < 0.05). Moreover, the expression of miR-34b was inversely correlated to CpG island methylation in tumor tissues, but not for miR-34a. In summary, our results suggest that DNA methylation may be involved in the inactivation of miR-34b in HCC.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704024","annotations":[{"name":"CpG island","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bisulfite sequencing","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.840988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.399514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Bisulfite","weight":0.393264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0623369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
