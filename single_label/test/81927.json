{"id":81927,"title":"Nasopalatine duct cyst, a delayed complication to successful dental implant placement: diagnosis and surgical management.","abstract":"The dental literature reports frequently on both the success and survival of dental implants, whereby the focus remains on the biological response of hard and soft tissue to the implants. The predication and anticipation of adverse implant events can then lead to the preemption of implant loss. However, biological situations can arise that are outside the control of the clinician. The author reports a case history of the late manifestation of a nasopalatine duct cyst in close proximity to a dental implant and its subsequent surgical management.
