{"id":66201,"title":"[Sex therapy for sexual dysfunctions].","abstract":"Sex therapy, a specialized form of psychotherapy for sexual dysfunctions, combines the three main therapeutic approaches, cognitive-behavioral, family and psychodynamic in an integrated approach. The treatment emphasis is first placed on the sexual symptom and then, if necessary, on understanding the underlying intrapsychic and interpersonal aspects of the disorder. In addition to work on the body and fantasies, sex therapy has integrated in recent years a number of innovative approaches: combination therapies, internet therapy, pain therapy and mindfulness. Sexual disorders can be difficult to treat. It is, therefore, important to take into account the role of biological, psychological, relational and cultural factors.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734364","annotations":[{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Psychodynamics","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.638854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.385058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sex therapy","weight":0.298745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_therapy"},{"name":"Fantasy (psychology)","weight":0.260541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_(psychology)"},{"name":"Mindfulness","weight":0.211916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Intrapsychic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapsychic"},{"name":"Social integration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration"}]}
