{"id":41642,"title":"Simeprevir with pegylated interferon alfa 2a or 2b plus ribavirin in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection (QUEST-2): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.","abstract":"Pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa 2a or 2b plus ribavirin regimens were the standard of care in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the sustained virological response can be suboptimum in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the combination of simeprevir, a one-pill, once-daily, oral HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor versus placebo, plus peginterferon alfa 2a or 2b plus ribavirin was assessed in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 infection.209 (81%) of 257 patients in the simeprevir group and 67 (50%) of 134 in the placebo group had SVR12 (adjusted difference 32路2%, 95% CI 23路3-41路2; p<0路0001). The incidences of adverse events were similar in the simeprevir and placebo groups at 12 weeks (246 [96%] vs 130 [97%]) and for the entire treatment (249 [97%] vs 132 [99%]), irrespective of the peginterferon alfa used. The most common adverse events were headache, fatigue, pyrexia, and influenza-like illness at 12 weeks (95 [37%) vs 45 [34%], 89 [35%] vs 52 [39%], 78 [30%] vs 48 [36%], and 66 [26%] vs 34 [25%], respectively) and for the entire treatment (100 [39%] vs 49 [37%], 94 [37%] vs 56 [42%], 79 [31%] vs 53 [40%], and 66 [26%] vs 35 [26%], respectively). Rash and photosensitivity frequencies were higher in the simeprevir group than in the placebo group (61 [24%] vs 15 [11%] and ten [4%] vs one [<1%], respectively). There was no difference in the prevalence of anaemia between the simeprevir and placebo groups (35 [14%] vs 21 [16%], respectively, at 12 weeks, and 53 [21%] vs 37 [28%], respectively, during the entire treatment).Addition of simeprevir to either peginterferon alfa 2a or peginterferon alfa 2b plus ribavirin improved SVR in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, without worsening the known adverse events associated with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin.Janssen Infectious Diseases-Diagnostics.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907224","annotations":[{"name":"Fever","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.800094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.680583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.651744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Photosensitivity","weight":0.636602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitivity"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.441775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.26955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Janssen Pharmaceutica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janssen_Pharmaceutica"},{"name":"Phase III trial","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_III_trial"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"}]}
