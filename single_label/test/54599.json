{"id":54599,"title":"Financially efficient cataract surgery in today's healthcare environment.","abstract":"To review the literature and create a concise evaluation and comment on the ways to provide financially efficient cataract surgery in a healthcare environment that produces significant challenges to providing care, while maintaining quality outcomes, safety, patient satisfaction, and employee satisfaction.The recent reductions in reimbursement for cataract surgery have fueled an increased need to drive innovation in ways to be more financially efficient. At the same time, new technology in the field, especially as it relates to use of the femtosecond laser for portions of lens surgery, has increased the challenges in creating an efficient and cost-effective structure for providing care.Cataract surgery is one of the most beneficial procedures for a patient's quality of life, and is one of the most common surgical procedures performed. At the same time, the current cost-effectiveness is quite high, and yet there are still ways to become more financially efficient in many centers providing cataract care.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415299","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.629798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.628215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.564734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.380113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.347222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.333593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.271639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.146389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Employee","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Reimbursement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reimbursement"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"}]}
