{"id":8653,"title":"Aminostyrylbenzofuran directly reduces oligomeric amyloid-? and reverses cognitive deficits in Alzheimer transgenic mice.","abstract":"Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-? into neurotoxic oligomers and plaques. Although many disease-modifying molecules are currently in Alzheimer clinical trials, a small molecule that inhibits amyloid-? aggregation and ameliorates the disorder has not been approved to date. Herein, we report the effects of a potent small molecule, 6-methoxy-2-(4-dimethylaminostyryl) benzofuran (KMS88009), that directly disrupts amyloid-? oligomerization, preserving cognitive behavior when used prophylactically and reversing declines in cognitive behavior when used therapeutically. KMS88009 exhibited excellent pharmacokinetic profiles with extensive brain uptake and a high level of safety. When orally administered before and after the onset of Alzheimer's disease symptoms, KMS88009 significantly reduced assembly of amyloid-? oligomers and improved cognitive behaviors in the APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse model. The unique dual mode of action indicates that KMS88009 may be a powerful therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
