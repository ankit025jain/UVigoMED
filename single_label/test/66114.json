{"id":66114,"title":"[Error prevention through management of complications in urology: standard operating procedures from commercial aviation as a model].","abstract":"Patient safety and risk/complication management rank among the current megatrends in modern medicine, which has undoubtedly become more complex. In time-critical, error-prone and difficult situations, which often occur repeatedly in everyday clinical practice, guidelines are inappropriate for acting rapidly and intelligently. With the establishment and consistent use of standard operating procedures like in commercial aviation, a possible strategic approach is available. These medical aids to decision-making - quick reference cards - are short, optimized instructions that enable a standardized procedure in case of medical claims.
