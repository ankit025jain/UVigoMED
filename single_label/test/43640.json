{"id":43640,"title":"Transcriptome profiling of the cancer and normal tissues from gastric cancer patients by deep sequencing.","abstract":"Gastric cancer is the second highest cause of global cancer mortality. Genome-wide screening of transcriptome dysregulation between cancer and normal tissues would provide insights into the molecular basis of gastric cancer initiation and progression. Recently, next-generation sequencing technique has started to revolutionize biomedical studies. RNA-seq method has become a superior approach in cancer studies, which enables accurate measurement of gene expression levels. In this work, we used RNA-seq data from tumor and matched normal samples to investigate their transcriptional changes. We totally identified 114 significantly differentially expressed genes, and these genes are highly enriched in some gene ontology (GO) categories, such as \"digestive system process,\" \"regulation of body fluid levels,\" \"secretion,\" \"digestion,\" etc. This study provided the preliminary survey of the transcriptome of Chinese gastric cancer patients, which provides better insights into the complexity of regulatory changes during tumorgenesis.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777338","annotations":[{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.727992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Body fluid","weight":0.69103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.576719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.567968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.327118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.22245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.222269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.210938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"China","weight":0.182518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Ontology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology"},{"name":"Gene Ontology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ontology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"RNA-Seq","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq"}]}
