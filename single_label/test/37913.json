{"id":37913,"title":"Hair band retained prosthetic reconstruction of bilaterally missing ears: a case of congenital atresia of external auditory canals and pinna.","abstract":"Auricular defects present reconstructive challenges, especially if they are bilateral. Surgical reconstruction provides effective results for defects; however for some patients surgical intervention is contraindicated. This case report describes an easy clinical technique to rehabilitate a patient with auricular defects. The prime purpose of this treatment rendered was to restore the lost auricular structure to the patient's satisfaction in an elegant, comfortable and cost effective manner.A thirteen year old female patient, who had bilaterally missing ears, was referred with a chief complaint of discomfort caused due to her existing hair band prosthesis and unsatisfactory esthetics. There was constant formation of ulcers at the site where the prosthesis came in contact with the skin. Considering the patient's age, ease of use and economic status, hair band retained ear prosthesis was selected. Silicone ear prostheses were fabricated on acrylic substructure to ensure fit, esthetics. Beneath the acrylic plates, a thin layer of soft silicone material was attached. The ear prostheses of both sides were connected with a metal hair band to retain.The newly fabricated prosthesis overcame the limitations of the existing one. The patient and her parents were satisfied with the results.The hair band retained silicone ear prosthesis is esthetic, economical and easy to use as a facial prosthesis. The addition of soft liner provided a cushion-like effect, thus reducing the formation of any ulcers due to pressure.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461322","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.833162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.712614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Pinna (anatomy)","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.595276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.566117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.470518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.409399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.38976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.359393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.285564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.276207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.228751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.174105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.148745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Facial prosthetic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_prosthetic"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Prime number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number"},{"name":"Tribal chief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Deception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"}]}
