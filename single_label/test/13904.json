{"id":13904,"title":"Hypertonic HBOC-201 decreases neutrophil activation after hemorrhagic shock.","abstract":"To evaluate neutrophil activation after exposure to standard HBC-201 (suspended in lactate Ringer's solution) versus HBOC-201 suspended in hypertonic 7.5% saline solution.We use plasma and tissue obtained from pigs subjected to controlled hemorrhagic shock and an ex vivo model of stimulated human whole blood. The pigs were resuscitated with the following (n = 8 per group) standard HBOC-201, or hypertonic HBOC-201. We used HTS 7.5%, Ringer's lactate as control resuscitation. Human blood was stimulated with same fluids. We measured the following neutrophil markers; IL-8, H2O2 in pig plasma, MPO in pig tissue, and H2O2, IL-8, and CD11b/CD18 in human whole blood.H2O2 and IL-8 as well as tissue MPO were significantly decreased in pigs resuscitated with HT-HBOC-201 and HT 7.5%. Ex vivo experiments blood diluted with HTS and HT-HBOC-201 revealed lower expression of CD11b/CD18, H2O2, and IL-8. Blood diluted with HBOC-201 had a higher CD11b/CD18 expression than blood diluted with LR solution.Our in vivo and ex vivo experiments indicate that HBOC-201 suspended in hypertonic 7.5% saline solution is associated with significantly less neutrophil activation when compared to standard HBOC-201 suspended in lactate Ringer's solution.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456255","annotations":[{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.842257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.718403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.652211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.631773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.527633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.477934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.448218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.386506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.35861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.346741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.235866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
