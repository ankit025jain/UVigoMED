{"id":5057,"title":"Physical and mental health correlates of adverse childhood experiences among low-income women.","abstract":"The present study used secondary data gathered from a statewide random sample of 1,073 adult women enrolled in Utah's single-parent cash assistance program and logistic regression to examine associations between self-reported physical, emotional, and sexual abuse during childhood and later life physical and mental health indicators. Results demonstrated significant associations between low-income women's self-reports of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse in childhood, and current and lifetime anxiety disorder, domestic violence, current posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, physical health or mental health issues, and any mental health diagnosis. These results build on previous research to paint a fuller picture of the associations between childhood abuse and physical and mental health for low-income women in Utah. Consistent with research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, findings suggest the applicability of conceptualizing childhood abuse as a public health issue. Social workers can play an integral role in promoting and implementing broader screening practices, connecting affected individuals with long-term interventions, and applying research findings to the design and provision of services within a public health model.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369722","annotations":[{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Domestic violence","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Sexual abuse","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.783879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.626731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.558909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.515743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.491104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.451744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.444756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Utah","weight":0.433174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.397303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.387499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.316339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Painting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
