{"id":3630,"title":"Diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted imaging in simultaneous 18F-FDG PET/MR imaging for whole-body staging of women with pelvic malignancies.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic benefit of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in an (18)F-FDG PET/MR imaging protocol for whole-body staging of women with primary or recurrent malignancies of the pelvis.Forty-eight patients with a primary pelvic malignancy or suspected recurrence of a pelvic malignancy were included in our study. All patients underwent a whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/MR imaging examination that included DWI. Two radiologists separately evaluated the PET/MR imaging datasets without DWI followed by a second interpretation with DWI. First, both readers identified all primary tumors, as well as lymph node and distant metastases. In a second session, PET and DWI data were assessed qualitatively. Image interpretation comprised lesion conspicuity defined as visual lesion-to-background contrast (4-point ordinal scale) and diagnostic confidence (3-point ordinal scale) for all tumors. The results from histopathologic examination and cross-sectional imaging follow-up (?6 mo) were used as the reference standard. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the significance of differences between obtained values.Among the 122 suspected lesions seen, 98 (80.3%) were considered malignant. PET/MR imaging without DWI had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of 92.9%, 87.5%, 96.8%, 75.0%, and 91.8%, respectively, for the detection of malignant lesions. PET/MR imaging with DWI had slightly higher values (94.9%, 83.3%, 95.9%, 80.0%, and 92.6%, respectively), but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). In the qualitative assessment of lesion-to-background contrast, PET had significantly (P < 0.05) higher values (3.79 ± 0.58) than DWI (3.63 ± 0.77). Furthermore, significantly (P < 0.05) higher scores were found for diagnostic confidence using PET (2.68 ± 0.64) for the determination of malignant lesions, when compared with DWI (2.53 ± 0.69).DWI in PET/MR imaging has no diagnostic benefit for whole-body staging of women with pelvic malignancies. The omission of DWI for staging or restaging gynecologic cancer may significantly reduce examination times, thus increasing patient comfort without a relevant decrease in diagnostic competence.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453042","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.795517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.78463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.701222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.687869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.589967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gynecologic oncology","weight":0.587555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologic_oncology"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.522818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.456296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.399442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.336452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Driving under the influence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Semantics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
