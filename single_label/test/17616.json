{"id":17616,"title":"Association between the degree of physical impairment from leprosy and dependence in activities of daily living among the elderly in a health unit in the State of Minas Gerais.","abstract":"In addition to the common alterations and diseases inherent in the aging process, elderly persons with a history of leprosy are particularly vulnerable to dependence because of disease-related impairments.determine whether physical impairment from leprosy is associated with dependence among the elderly.An analytical cross-sectional study of elderly individuals with a history of leprosy and no signs of cognitive impairment was conducted using a database from a former leprosy colony-hospital. The patients were evaluated for dependence in the basic activities of daily living (BADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), respectively) and subjected to standard leprosy physical disability grading. Subsequently, descriptive and univariate analyses were conducted, the latter using Pearson's chi-squared test.A total of 186 elderly persons were included in the study. Of these individuals, 53.8% were women, 49.5% were older than 75 years of age, 93% had four or less years of formal education, 24.2% lived in an institution for the long-term care of the elderly (ILTC), and 18.3% had lower limb amputations. Among those evaluated, 79.8% had visible physical impairments from leprosy (grade 2), 83.3% were independent in BADL, and 10.2% were independent in IADL. There was a higher impairment grade among those patients who were IADL dependent (p=0.038).The leprosy physical impairment grade is associated with dependence for IADL, creating the need for greater social support and systematic monitoring by a multidisciplinary team. The results highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy to prevent physical impairment and dependence in later years.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861296","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.752627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.704142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.438193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.376252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.267722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"History","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.156225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Physical disability","weight":0.109511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Logic","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Military organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_organization"}]}
