{"id":21663,"title":"Ketoconazole or clotrimazole solution wash as a prophylaxis in management and prevention of fungal infection: a comparative study.","abstract":"The incidence of fungal infections has increased at an alarming rate in the past two decades. Topical Ketoconazole and Clotrimazole solutions are used to stop growth of fungus like Dermatophytes, Candidiasis and Pityrosporum. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic Ketoconazole or Clotrimazole solution wash in patients with fungal infections. Hundred patients (aged 10-60 yrs) with different fungal infections (Candida, Tinea, Pityriasis) were included. The study groups were divided into intervention group and control group. The Intervention group was given 5 weeks prophylactic Ketoconazole/Clotrimazole shampoo wash along with antifungal treatment whereas the control group was given only antifungal treatment without prophylaxis. All the patients were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months interval to find out the response and recurrence. After one month of treatment 96% of patients in the intervention group and 60% of patients in the control group were completely cured. The recurrence rate after 3 mths of treatment was 4% in the intervention group and 40% in the control group. After 6 months the recurrence rate was 4% in the intervention group and 60% in the control group. The most common problem with fungal infections is the recurrence. Use of prophylactic antifungal (Ketoconazole/Clotrimazole) wash for some period of time along with antifungal treatment minimizes the chances of recurrence.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592790","annotations":[{"name":"Ketoconazole","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Clotrimazole","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clotrimazole"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Tinea","weight":0.799138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea"},{"name":"Shampoo","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.775131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.766461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Malassezia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malassezia"},{"name":"Dermatophyte","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatophyte"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.221499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mouthwash","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthwash"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"1060","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1060"},{"name":"Total chances","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_chances"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pityriasis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pityriasis"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Northern Territory National Emergency Response","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_National_Emergency_Response"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
