{"id":19749,"title":"[Reverse shoulder arthroplasty: complications and prevention].","abstract":"The total shoulder prosthesis in reverse was designed as a treatment for patients with arthropathy deficiency rotator cuff because the conservative treatment failed. The indications for its use have evolved; these include arthropathy deficient rotator cuff, reconstruction humeral head fractures, hemiarthroplasties revision and reconstruction after tumor resection. Successful placement depends on the patient having a function adequately and good quality deltoid in the glenoid bone and in the proximal humerus. Until a few years ago data was no clear on the success of this procedure, currently encouraging results have been reported, however, they have had a high cost due to the high rate of complications, which are divided into specific and common to the prosthesis shoulder surgeries. The primary objective of this review is to assess the most common complications of the prosthesis in reverse, how to treat them and how we can avoid them.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701766","annotations":[{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.808529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.610423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.582755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.510248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.491778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.373483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.241581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Deltoid muscle","weight":0.175391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Upper extremity of humerus","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_extremity_of_humerus"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Historical revisionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Arthropathy","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropathy"}]}
