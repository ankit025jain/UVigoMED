{"id":37569,"title":"Developmental cigarette smoke exposure: hippocampus proteome and metabolome profiles in low birth weight pups.","abstract":"Exposure to cigarette smoke during development is linked to neurodevelopmental delays and cognitive impairment including impulsivity, attention deficit disorder, and lower IQ. However, brain region specific biomolecular alterations induced by developmental cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) remain largely unexplored. In the current molecular phenotyping study, a mouse model of 'active' developmental CSE (serum cotinine > 50 ng/mL) spanning pre-implantation through third trimester-equivalent brain development (gestational day (GD) 1 through postnatal day (PD) 21) was utilized. Hippocampus tissue collected at the time of cessation of exposure was processed for gel-based proteomic and non-targeted metabolomic profiling with partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for selection of features of interest. Ingenuity pathway analysis was utilized to identify candidate molecular and metabolic pathways impacted within the hippocampus. CSE impacted glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and neurodevelopment pathways within the developing hippocampus.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and
