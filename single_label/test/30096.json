{"id":30096,"title":"Observational study on medications prescribed to dual-diagnosis outpatients.","abstract":"To quantify the number of medications used for treating psychiatric and addictive disorders in a cohort of dual diagnosis with substance dependence outpatients and report the most frequent pharmacological groups used.A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted. Demographic data, Axis I comorbidity diagnosis with substance dependence, and the medications prescribed were recorded. Diagnosis was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).One hundred seven patients (mean age 37.7 years; SD = 10.2 years) were evaluated (76.6% men). On average, patients took 4.0 (SD = 1.8) medications. The pharmacological groups prescribed were antipsychotics (69.2%) followed by antidepressants (65.4%), antiepileptics (58.9%), anxiolytics (37.4%), alcohol-aversive drugs (15.9%), methadone (15.9%), lithium (3.7%), and naltrexone (2.8%). Older patients (>45 years old) were found to have a higher number of prescribed medications. Patients diagnosed with a dual psychotic disorder were prescribed a larger number of pharmacological agents (mean = 4.4; SD = 2.1) than patients with a mood disorder (mean = 3.7; SD = 1.3) or an anxiety disorder (mean = 2.9; SD = 1.2), K = 10.5, P = 0.005.Because polypharmacy is frequent in patients with mental illness and a co-occurring substance use disorder, specialized approaches need to be developed.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562401","annotations":[{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Mood disorder","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder"},{"name":"Methadone","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone"},{"name":"Naltrexone","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Lithium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dual diagnosis","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_diagnosis"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.724806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Anxiolytic","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Polypharmacy","weight":0.663102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypharmacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.460451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.42225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.35191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Observational learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_learning"}]}
