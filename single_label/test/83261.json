{"id":83261,"title":"Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs): a view from the laboratory.","abstract":"Disadvantages with traditional anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists and heparinoids) have led to the development on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). These agents are set to replace the traditional anticoagulants in situations such as following orthopaedic surgery, in atrial fibrillation, and in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. Although superior to vitamin K antagonists and heparinoids in several aspects, NOACs retain the ability to cause haemorrhage and, despite claims to the contrary, may need monitoring. This review aims to summarise key aspects of the NOACs of relevance to the laboratory.","date":"2015-01-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562993","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin K","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.688987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.660539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.423343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.403481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.233764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.181057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Heparinoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparinoid"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"}]}
