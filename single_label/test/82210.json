{"id":82210,"title":"Peri-implantitis diagnosis and treatment by New Zealand periodontists and oral maxillofacial surgeons.","abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the understanding, diagnosis and management of peri-implantitis by New Zealand periodontists and oral maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS).Telephone interviews (in combination with a postal and electronic survey) were conducted of all 25 periodontists and 32 OMFS listed as specialists on the New Zealand Dental Register. A seven item multi-choice and short answer questionnaire was used to investigate: their definition of peri-implantitis; the number of annual referrals received in their practice for this condition; their diagnostic, preventive and treatment strategies for peri-implantitis; and their perception of the role of general dental practitioners in its management.The participation rate was 84.6%. Most respondents defined peri-implantitis as a disease of multifactorial aetiology that leads to destruction of the bone supporting an implant. The average number of cases seen annually differed between periodontists (11 cases/year) and OMFS (4 cases/year). The criteria used by the respondents to diagnose peri-implantitis included increased probing depths and radiographic evidence of bone loss. Each type of specialist used mechanical debridement for treatment, but a higher proportion of OMFS performed surgical procedures as treatment. The prevention strategies used smoking cessation advice and ensuring good plaque control. All respondents agreed that peri-implantitis is an important disease that can lead to implant failure, and all acknowledged the role of general dental practitioners in diagnosis, referral for treatment and long-term implant maintenance.The definition, diagnostic criteria and management strategies used by New Zealand specialists are generally consistent with those found in the literature. No evidence-based, gold standard treatment protocol for peri-implantitis has been identified in the literature, and New Zealand specialists use a range of treatment modalities.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic
