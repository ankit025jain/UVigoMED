{"id":21497,"title":"Distribution of carbapenem resistance determinants among epidemic and non-epidemic types of Acinetobacter species in Japan.","abstract":"We performed a comparative molecular analysis on three types of clinically isolated Acinetobacter spp.: epidemic sequence types (STs) of Acinetobacter baumannii (epidemic ST-AB), non-epidemic sequence types of A. baumannii (non-epidemic ST-AB) and non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. A total of 87 isolates - 46 A. baumannii, 25 A. pittii and 16 A. nosocomialis - from 43 hospitals were analysed. Of these, 31 A. baumannii isolates were ST1 or ST2 according to the Pasteur Institute multilocus sequence typing scheme and were defined as epidemic ST-AB. The other 15 A. baumannii isolates were defined as non-epidemic ST-AB. The epidemic ST-AB isolates harboured the blaOXA-23-like gene or had an ISAba1 element upstream of blaOXA-51-like, or both, whereas non-epidemic ST-AB and non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. isolates harboured blaOXA-58-like or metallo-?-lactamase genes, or both. The proportion of multidrug-resistant isolates was significantly higher in the epidemic ST-AB isolates (48?%) than that in the other types of Acinetobacter isolates (5?%) (P<0.05). In addition, epidemic ST-AB isolates exhibited a relatively higher proportion of fluoroquinolone resistance. We demonstrated that, in terms of genotypes and phenotypes of antimicrobial resistance, non-epidemic ST-AB isolates shared more similarity with non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. isolates than with epidemic ST-AB isolates, regardless of bacterial species. In addition, this study revealed that, even in Japan, where IMP-type metallo-?-lactamase producers are endemic, epidemic ST-AB harbouring blaIMP have not yet emerged.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600014","annotations":[{"name":"Pasteur Institute","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur_Institute"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.77463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.763288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.677871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Louis Pasteur","weight":0.59363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.539036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.433747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.386841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.334165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.239847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Ducati ST2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_ST2"}]}
