{"id":31120,"title":"The science of tobacco addiction and cessation.","abstract":"Over the past decade, researchers have found genetic variations that affect how nicotine, the main addictive component of tobacco, interacts with cells in the brain and how fast the body metabolizes it. Carrying a high-risk variant predicts a person's ability to snuff out their cigarettes for good. Genetic testing could help predict which smokers might benefit from nicotine replacement therapy or other prescription medications, much like sequencing of malignant tumors can point to the most effective cancer treatment.
