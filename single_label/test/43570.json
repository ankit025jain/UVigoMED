{"id":43570,"title":"Surgical resection of hepatic and cardiac neuroendocrine metastases from a caecal primary tumour.","abstract":"A 66-year-old patient had an incidentally detected caecal neuroendocrine tumour that had metastasised to the liver and left atrium. He was asymptomatic with regard to this tumour and did not have carcinoid syndrome. Resection of the primary tumour and the metastatic deposits (with the ablation of one lesion) is thought to be curative.
