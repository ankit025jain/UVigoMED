{"id":91345,"title":"Advances in nerve transfer surgery.","abstract":"Peripheral nerve injuries are devastating injuries and can result in physical impairments, poor functional outcomes and high levels of disability. Advances in our understanding of peripheral nerve regeneration and nerve topography have lead to the development of nerve transfers to restore function. Over the past two decades, nerve transfers have been performed and modified. With the advancements in surgical management and recognition of importance of cortical plasticity, motor-reeducation and perioperative rehabilitation, nerve transfers are producing improved functional outcomes in patients with nerve injuries. This manuscript explores the recent literature as it relates to current nerve transfer techniques and advances in post-operative rehabilitation protocols, with a focus on indications, techniques and outcomes.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513183","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.399442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.292159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.165793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Neuroregeneration","weight":0.0176757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroregeneration"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Transfer (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"}]}
