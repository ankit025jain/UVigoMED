{"id":55967,"title":"[Intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in pathological myopia (PM): a review].","abstract":"Anti-VEGF injections are widely used \"off-label\" for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia based on data generated by multiple case series with small sample sizes. In this review we have analyzed the results of case series with at least 20 patients and a follow-up of ? 12 months. 18 case series were identified in Medline meeting these demands. The mean gain of visual acuity after 12 months was 2.2 ± 0.7 (mean ± 1 standard deviation, case number weighted: 2.0) lines with a mean of 3.0 ± 1.7 injections (case number weighted 2.7). There was no significant difference between bevacizumab and ranibizumab. The mean gain of visual acuity in the first year could be stabilized in the second year with a visual acuity of a mean of 2.2 ± 1.0 lines at the end of follow-up. The mean age of patients at the beginning was 56.0 ± 6.0 (case number weighted: 56.2). The results of this analysis indicate very clearly that a favourable long-term outcome can be achieved with a relatively small number of injections in cases of choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771180","annotations":[{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.270556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christelijk_Nationaal_Vakverbond"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"}]}
