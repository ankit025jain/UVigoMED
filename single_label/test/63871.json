{"id":63871,"title":"Immunology and immunotherapy of chronic myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal bone marrow stem cell neoplasia known to be responsive to immunotherapy. Despite the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the BCR-ABL1 oncokinase, patients are not considered to be cured with the current therapy modalities. However, there have been recent advancements in understanding the immunobiology of the disease (such as tumor specific antigens and immunostimulatory agents), and this may lead to the development of novel, curative treatment strategies. Already there are promising results showing that a small proportion of CML patients are able to discontinue the therapy although they have a minimal amount of residual leukemia cells left. This implies that the immune system is able to restrain the tumor cell expansion. In this review, we aim to give a brief update of the novel aspects of the immune system in CML patients and of the developing strategies for controlling CML by the means of immunotherapy.
