{"id":43388,"title":"Meningeal melanocytoma: case report and literature review.","abstract":"We report a case of a 54-year-old female with progressive chronic pain in lower extremity, paraplegia and loss of function of the anal sphincter. MRI revealed an expansive solid intradural and intramedullar lesion located at the T6 to T9 levels. Histology of the lesion showed melanocytes with the results of immunohistochemistry consistent with a melanocytoma. Melanocytic tumors are rare tumors which present a diagnostic and management challenge for the modern neurosurgeon and neuro-oncologist since MRI and CT features are non-specific and there is scant data to standardise best strategic therapy.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791361","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Meninges","weight":0.61841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.593052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.533312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Spinal tumor","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_tumor"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.0808391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
