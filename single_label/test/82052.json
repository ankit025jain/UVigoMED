{"id":82052,"title":"Effect of experimental mouthrinses containing the combination of NaF and TiF4 on enamel erosive wear in vitro.","abstract":"This study analysed the anti-erosive effect of experimental solutions containing TiF4 and NaF.Bovine enamel samples (n=15) were treated with: (1) commercial solution with SnCl2/NaF (Erosion Protection(Â®)); (2) experimental solution with 0.0815% TiF4; (3) 0.105% NaF; (4) 0.042% NaF + 0.049% TiF4; (5) 0.063% NaF + 0.036% TiF4 or (6) control. The samples were submitted to pH cycles and daily fluoride applications for seven days. The enamel wear was measured using a contact profilometer and analysed by ANOVA (p < 0.05).The best anti-erosive effect was found for experimental solution with 0.0815% TiF4 (99% reduction in enamel wear), followed by SnCl2/NaF (78%) and 0.049% TiF4 + 0.042% NaF solution (41%).The experimental solution containing a specific combination of TiF4 + NaF has the ability to partially reduce enamel erosion.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727005","annotations":[{"name":"PH","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.333689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.297784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.155323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Profilometer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profilometer"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
