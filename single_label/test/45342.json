{"id":45342,"title":"Expression of HLA class I antigen, aspirin use, and survival after a diagnosis of colon cancer.","abstract":"Use of aspirin (which inhibits platelet function) after a colon cancer diagnosis is associated with improved overall survival. Identifying predictive biomarkers of this effect could individualize therapy and decrease toxic effects.To demonstrate that survival benefit associated with low-dose aspirin use after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer might depend on HLA class I antigen expression.A cohort study with tumor blocks from 999 patients with colon cancer (surgically resected between 2002 and 2008), analyzed for HLA class I antigen and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) expression using a tissue microarray. Mutation analysis of PIK3CA was also performed. Data on aspirin use after diagnosis were obtained from a prescription database. Parametric survival models with exponential (Poisson) distribution were used to model the survival.Overall survival.The overall survival benefit associated with aspirin use after a diagnosis of colon cancer had an adjusted rate ratio (RR) of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.38-0.74; P <?.001) when tumors expressed HLA class I antigen compared with an RR of 1.03 (0.66-1.61; P =?.91) when HLA antigen expression was lost. The benefit of aspirin was similar for tumors with strong PTGS2 expression (0.68; 0.48-0.97; P?=?.03), weak PTGS2 expression (0.59; 0.38-0.97; P =?.02), and wild-type PIK3CA tumors (0.55; 0.40-0.75; P <?.001). No association was observed with mutated PIK3CA tumors (0.73; 0.33-1.63; P =?.44).Contrary to the original hypothesis, aspirin use after colon cancer diagnosis was associated with improved survival if tumors expressed HLA class I antigen. Increased PTGS2 expression or the presence of mutated PIK3CA did not predict benefit from aspirin. HLA class I antigen might serve as a predictive biomarker for adjuvant aspirin therapy in colon cancer.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System
