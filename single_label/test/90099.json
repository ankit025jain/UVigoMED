{"id":90099,"title":"Distal radius fractures in athletes: approaches and treatment considerations.","abstract":"Fractures of the distal radius are common injuries in both athletes and nonathletes. Management is dictated by the nature of the fracture and the patient's level of competition, age, and sport-specific demands. Treatment strategies range from nonoperative treatment for stable injuries to primarily operative treatment for unstable fractures, particularly in active athletes. Once the decision has been made to treat a distal radius fracture operatively, a wide variety of fixation options are available. However, no technique has proven superior to all others, and no single method of fixation will lead to acceptable results in all types of distal radius fractures. This study will highlight important considerations when treating distal radius fractures in athletes, describe the various fixation options available, and discuss our method for determining the fixation needs of each fracture.
