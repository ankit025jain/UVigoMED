{"id":36790,"title":"Congenital umbilical arterio-venous malformation: a word of caution.","abstract":"We report on an 18-month old girl who presented in good clinical shape with a pulsatile tumour in the umbilical area which had a shape and localization similar to that of an umbilical bowel hernia. The Doppler ultrasound of the umbilical tumour revealed a large arterio-venous vascular malformation with a haemodynamically significant blood shunting. Furthermore, the inferior caval vein and the hepatic veins were dilated. Computed tomography angiography revealed permeable umbilical veins and arteries communicating within a large dilated arterio-venous fistula. The growing tumour was excised without any perioperative complications. Further postoperative recovery was uneventful and the baby was discharged 10 days after surgery. We advocate careful antenatal ultrasound evaluation of these vascular malformations. Early surgical removal in newborns is vital in order to avoid severe complications.
