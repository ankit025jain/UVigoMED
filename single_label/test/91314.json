{"id":91314,"title":"Clinical translation of human microRNA 21 as a potential biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation.","abstract":"This study investigated to what extent the serum microRNA 21 (miR-21) level alters in response to ionizing radiation (IR). Initially, we evaluated the appropriateness of our RNA extraction efficiency and microRNA assay in serum, and then investigated the serum miR-21 level in 4 patients with breast cancer in 4 stages: pre- and postoperation, at the beginning radiotherapy, and after 25 sessions of radiotherapy with a total of 50 Gy irradiation, as well as in 20 healthy volunteers. The initial analysis showed the appropriateness of our RNA extraction efficiency and microRNA assay in serum for identifying people exposed to IR. We then analyzed the serum miR-21 level in another group of 40 patients with breast cancer before and after radiotherapy. During our large-scale analysis, the miR-21 level before radiotherapy was comparable with healthy volunteers (P = 0.10) and increased significantly after radiotherapy (P < 0.001)-an indication that this could discriminate irradiated patients from nonirradiated ones with high specificity (75%) and sensitivity (80%). According to this study, serum miR-21 has the potential to be used as a biomarker for the identification of people exposed to ionizing radiation.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518062","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.870187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.750608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.653993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.621643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.559039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.476707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.336452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.310055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.30633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.205389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
