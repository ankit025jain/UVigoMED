{"id":88199,"title":"Combined effect of teriparatide and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound for nonunion: a case report.","abstract":"Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound is a pain-free therapy performed daily at home by the patient and has been shown to promote fracture healing. Teriparatide is a parathyroid hormone preparation that activates osteoblastic bone formation and is also reported to be effective in promoting bony union.We report the case of a 56-year-old Japanese male with a femoral shaft fracture who underwent intramedullary osteosynthesis nailing initially. He had no radiologic or clinical sign of healing 3 months later and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound was initiated at that time. He was reassessed in another 3 months, with evidence of mild bone consolidation but the fracture gap persisted. Subsequent treatment with human parathyroid hormone was initiated in combination with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound. Full fracture healing was present 6 months after beginning the combination low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and teriparatide. It is hypothesized that the potential additive effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and teriparatide therapy ultimately triggered sufficient bone formation to support osseous union.The case reported herein is a femoral shaft atrophic nonunion in which traditional interventions failed. Successful fracture healing was finally achieved with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and teriparatide therapy. This is the first reported case of diaphyseal nonunion with deterioration of bone quality in long bones resolved with teriparatide and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886079","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.842517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.803028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteoblast","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.627804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Teriparatide","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.310941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.251096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.230524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"}]}
