{"id":42366,"title":"Hepatic PPAR? and LXR? independently regulate lipid accumulation in the livers of genetically obese mice.","abstract":"The nuclear hormone receptors liver X receptor ? (LXR?) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) play key roles in the development of fatty liver. To determine the link between hepatic PPAR? and LXR? signaling and the development of fatty liver, a LXR?-specific ligand, T0901317, was administered to normal OB/OB and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice lacking hepatic PPAR? (Ppar?(?H)). In ob/ob-Ppar?(?H) and OB/OB-Ppar?(?H) mice, as well as ob/ob-Ppar?(WT) and OB/OB-Ppar?(WT) mice, the liver weights and hepatic triglyceride levels were markedly increased in response to T0901317 treatment. These results suggest that hepatic PPAR? and LXR? signals independently contribute to the development of fatty liver.
