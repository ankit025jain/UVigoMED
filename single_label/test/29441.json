{"id":29441,"title":"Decreased delay discounting in former cigarette smokers at one year after treatment.","abstract":"Current cigarette smokers exhibit greater delay discounting relative to ex-smokers. However, few studies have assessed longitudinal changes in delay discounting and cigarette smoking. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in delay discounting of hypothetical monetary rewards and smoking among treatment-seeking smokers (N=80) at baseline, after 6 weeks of behavioral treatment, and at 12-month follow-up. Results showed no changes in delay discounting in either smokers or abstainers at the end-of-treatment. In contrast, at 12-month follow-up, significant decreases in delay discounting were observed in abstainers while delay discounting remained the same for smokers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to observe significant decreases in delay discounting following prolonged smoking abstinence. Such findings provide evidence that delay discounting may have more state-like characteristics than previously believed.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661901","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.647587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.644641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.525419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.173369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"Monetary policy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"N80 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N80_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Discounting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounting"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
