{"id":26958,"title":"Absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow in human subjects with or without myocardial ischemia using dynamic flurpiridaz F 18 PET.","abstract":"Absolute quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) by PET is an established method of analyzing coronary artery disease (CAD) but subject to the various shortcomings of available radiotracers. Flurpiridaz F 18 is a novel PET radiotracer that exhibits properties of an ideal tracer.A new absolute perfusion quantitation method with flurpiridaz was developed, taking advantage of the early kinetics and high first-pass extraction by the myocardium of this radiotracer, and the first-in-human measurements of MBF performed in 7 healthy subjects and 8 patients with documented CAD. PET images with time-activity curves were acquired at rest and during adenosine stress.In healthy subjects, regional MBF between coronary artery territories did not differ significantly, leading to a mean global MBF of 0.73 mL/min/g at rest and 2.53 mL/min/g during stress, with a mean global myocardial flow reserve (MFR) of 3.70. CAD vascular territories with <50% stenosis demonstrated a mean MBF of 0.73 at rest and 2.02 during stress, leading to a mean MFR of 2.97. CAD vascular territories with ?50% stenosis exhibited a mean MBF of 0.86 at rest and 1.43 during stress, leading to a mean MFR of 1.86. Differences in stress MBF and MFR between normal and CAD territories, as well as between <50% and ?50% stenosis vascular territories, were significant (P < 0.01).Absolute quantitation of MBF in humans with the novel PET radiotracer flurpiridaz is feasible over a wide range of cardiac flow in the presence or absence of stress-inducible myocardial ischemia. The significant decrease in stress MBF and ensuing MFR in CAD territories allows a clear distinction between vascular territories exhibiting stress-inducible myocardial ischemia and those with normal perfusion.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25071096","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.83479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.814652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Myocardial ischemia","weight":0.610052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_ischemia"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.47261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.323873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"}]}
