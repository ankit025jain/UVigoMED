{"id":80739,"title":"Toxoplasma gondii genotypes isolated from pregnant women with follow-up of infected children in southern Brazil.","abstract":"Toxoplasma gondii populations that perpetuate in South America's natural ecosystems display broad genetic diversity, but the impact of this diversity on humans is generally unknown. In this short communication, we depict the genotypic traits of four isolates related to congenital parasitism as it emerges in Southern Brazil.Using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism markers SAG1, 5'3'SAG2, alt. SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, Apico, and CS3. Three of the four strains (TgCTBral, TgCTBrv, and TgCTBrac) were identified as ToxoDB genotype #166.Three children displayed normal cognitive/psychomotor development, and one child displayed Sabin's tetrad (TgCTBral).Vertical transmission of the two genotypes was observed and contributes to knowledge of T. gondii strains isolated from humans in Brazil.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24554488","annotations":[{"name":"Vertical transmission","weight":0.805364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_transmission"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.738551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.700262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Ecosystem","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Toxoplasma gondii","weight":0.544348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.500236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.428827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.330791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Americas","weight":0.297132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.247041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"South Region, Brazil","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Adobe Photoshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"358","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/358"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Screen Actors Guild","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
