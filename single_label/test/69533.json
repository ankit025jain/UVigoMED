{"id":69533,"title":"[Combined treatment of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction].","abstract":"In men of middle and older age group, urination disorders and erectile dysfunction are often combined. The role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment of these patients remains uninvestigated. Prospective study included 38 patients with urination disorders and erectile dysfunction. The average age of the patients was 63.6 +/- 5.3 years. During first three months of observation, all patients have received alpha-adrenoblocker doxazosin at a dose of 4 mg once daily per os, the next three months--phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor udenafil at a dose of 50 mg once daily per os was added to doxazosin. 3 months after treatment, majority of patients reported improvement of urination. The statistically significant changes in BP and heart rate were not recorded, indicating a satisfactory tolerability and safety of doxazosin. Against the background of combined treatment during next 3 months, progressive improvement of erectile function (IIEF score 12.8 +/- 3.4 vs 18.4 +/- 3.7; p < 0.05), and regression of urination disorders, according to IPSS score (13.4 +/- 1.2 vs 11.2 +/- 1.7; p < 0.05) were observed. Uroflowmetric indicators were not significantly changed. Based on experimental and clinical studies, it was suggested that the dysregulation of NO--cGMP system, pathological activation of Rho-kinase pathways, hyperactivity of autonomic innervation, atherosclerosis and impaired blood flow in the pelvic organs are the common pathophysiological mechanisms for LUTS and erectile dysfunction. The clinical efficacy of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with these diseases is explained by its effects on these mechanisms.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437244","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.556219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.52381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.491594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.313159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Phosphodiesterase","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Doxazosin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxazosin"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"CGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGMP-specific_phosphodiesterase_type_5"}]}
