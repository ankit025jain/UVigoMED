{"id":81612,"title":"[Orthopedic treatment of dento-skeletal Class II by the association minivis + Forsus(TM): a clinical case].","abstract":"The use of customized combination mechanics with two auxillaries such as mini screws and Forsus(TM) Springs that up to now have been used independently, achieved unexpected results in the correction of a non-surgical skeletal Class II malocclusion. The use of mini implants to control the canting of the occlusal plane that is frequently reported during the use of hyperpropulsors with fixed appliances made it possible to achieve a better mandibular outcome.
