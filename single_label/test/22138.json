{"id":22138,"title":"Bacterial meningitis in adults in Iceland, 1995-2010.","abstract":"Bacterial meningitis is a serious disease with a mortality rate of 15-20% in adults. We conducted a population-based study of bacterial meningitis in adults (? 16 y) in Iceland, 1995-2010.Cases were identified based on positive bacterial cultures from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or the ICD codes for bacterial meningitis. Medical charts were reviewed and outcomes were assessed using the national population registry. The study period was divided into 2 equal parts, 1995-2002 and 2003-2010, before and after implementation of routine childhood vaccination against serogroup C meningococci, respectively.In total, 111 episodes occurred in 110 individuals. The most common causative organisms were Neisseria meningitidis (41%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (30%). Only 30% of the patients presented with the classical symptom triad of fever, neck stiffness, and an altered mental status. The overall incidence was 3.2/100,000 inhabitants/y, and dropped significantly between the first and second halves of the study (p = 0.03). This drop was due to a reduced incidence of N. meningitidis meningitis: 34 and 12 cases in the first and second periods, respectively (p = 0.006). The incidence of meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae remained unchanged. The case fatality rates were 18% and 13% in the first and second halves of the study, respectively (difference not significant).The incidence of bacterial meningitis has decreased since the implementation of meningococcal C vaccination in 2002. However, the case fatality rate has remained unchanged.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568594","annotations":[{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Altered level of consciousness","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_level_of_consciousness"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Meningism","weight":0.600766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningism"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.59089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.581295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Neisseria","weight":0.443794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria"},{"name":"Iceland","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.274422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Mental status examination","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_status_examination"},{"name":"Bacterial meningitis","weight":0.205857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_meningitis"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.193608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
