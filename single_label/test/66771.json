{"id":66771,"title":"Laparoscopic nephropexy with polymer clips.","abstract":"We present our initial experience and long-term results with transperitoneal laparoscopic nephropexy with nonabsorbable polymer clips.Seven patients aged 34 to 47 years previously diagnosed with mobile kidney presented with chronic pain refractory to analgesics and underwent a transperitoneal laparoscopic nephropexy procedure with nonabsorbable polymer clips by fixing the perirenal tissue to the transversus abdominis fascia and triangular ligament.Mean operation time was 20 minutes. All patients were discharged after 24 hours. Follow-up intravenous pyelogram (IVP) at 60 and 150 days showed the right kidneys in a more cephalad position, and showed pelvicaliceal dilatations and that the ureteral kinks seemed to be resolved. On days 15, 60, 90, and 150 of the first- and second-year follow-ups, severity of pain was 1 of 10 on the visual analog scale.We believe that the technique of transperitoneal laparascopic nephropexy with nonabsorbable polymer clips on patients with symptomatic mobile kidney is safe and easy to perform and shows successful long-term results.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680153","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.797301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.731945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.703613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.543158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.385993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.354398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Transversus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Triangle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Adipose capsule of kidney","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_capsule_of_kidney"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Sine-Gordon equation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Gordon_equation"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
