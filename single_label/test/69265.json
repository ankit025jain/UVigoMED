{"id":69265,"title":"What the interventionalist should know about renal denervation in hypertensive patients: a position paper by the ESH WG on the interventional treatment of hypertension.","abstract":"Percutaneous catheter-based transluminal renal denervation (RDN) has emerged as a new approach to achieve sustained blood pressure reduction in patients with drug-resistant hypertension. Experts from ESH and ESC in their recently released position papers and consensus document have summarised the current evidence, unmet needs and practical recommendations for the application of this therapeutic strategy in clinical practice. Experts of the ESH Working Group for the interventional treatment of hypertension prepared this position paper in order to provide interventionalists with guidance through the procedure of RDN. Given that there is no established intraprocedural control of ablation success, interventionalists have to be familiar with the aspects related to the anatomy and imaging of the renal arteries, the distribution of renal sympathetic fibres, the special equipment necessary for RDN and the procedural details in order to maximise the success and minimise potential complications.
