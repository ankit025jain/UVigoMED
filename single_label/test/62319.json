{"id":62319,"title":"Serial chitotriosidase measurements in sarcoidosis--two to five year follow-up study.","abstract":"Chitotriosidase (CTO) is a human chitinolytic enzyme secreted by activated macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Albeit not specific for sarcoidosis, it is increased in over 90% of patients with active disease. The aims of this study were to correlate CTO measurements with clinical assessment of sarcoidosis and to test CTO as a marker of sarcoidosis relapse.95 patients were followed-up for 24-60 months. Serial CTO measurements were performed every 3-6 months and correlated to clinical symptoms, lung function (FVC and DLco) and chest X-ray. In 38 patients clinical outcome status (COS) at 5 years was determined.Initial CTO levels were significantly higher in patients with impaired FVC/DLco (p = 0.011 for both) but there was no correlation with standard chest X-ray stages. Patients with Loefgren's syndrome had significantly lower initial and control CTO level compared to other patients (p = 0.011 and p = 0.001, respectively). At follow-up there was a positive correlation of CTO and deterioration of clinical symptoms (p < 0.001), chest X-ray (p < 0.001) and FVC/DLco (p = 0.012 and p = 0.086, respectively). Control CTO levels were significantly lower in no disease groups versus minimal or persistent disease group as defined by COS (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). At relapse CTO increased for 100% or more from baseline value in 12/14 patients.It was shown that CTO correlates with certain sarcoidosis phenotypes (Loefgren's syndrome, COS) and that serial measurements of CTO correlate with clinical symptoms, chest radiographs and lung function.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594143","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.455374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.365087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.295179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.14988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1214"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Chief technology officer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
