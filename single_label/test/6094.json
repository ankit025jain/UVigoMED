{"id":6094,"title":"[Effect of chaishu sijun decoction on the gonad axis of gan-qi stagnation, Pi deficiency, and gan-qi stagnation pi deficiency model rats].","abstract":"To observe changes of gonad functions of Gan-qi stagnation (GS), Pi deficiency (PD), Gan-qi stagnation Pi deficiency (GSPD) model rats, and the effect of Chaishu Sijun Decoction (CSD) on them.Rats were randomly divided into 7 groups according to romdom digit table, i.e., the normal control group, the GS model group, the GS medication group, the PD model group, the PD medication group, the GSPD model group,and the GSPD medication group, 10 in each group. Rats in the GS model group, the PD model group, and the GSPD model group were treated with chronic restraint, improper diet +excessive fatigue, chronic restraint +improper diet +excessive fatigue. The model was established for 4 successive weeks. Starting from the 15th day of modeling, CSD at the daily dose of 3.57 g/kg was given by gastrogavage to them for 14 successive days. Equal volume of distilled water was given by gastrogavage to rats in each model group and the normal control group for 14 successive days. The blood contents of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) were detected in rats of each group.Compared with the normal control group, there was statistical difference in GnRH, T, E,, and FSH in the GS, PD, and GSPD model groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The content of LH was elevated in the GS model group (P < 0.05) and declined in the GSPD model group (P < 0.01). Compared with the GS model group, the contents of FSH, LH, and T decreased and E2 increased in the PD model group (all P < 0.05); the contents of FSH and LH also declined in the GSPD model group (P < 0.05). Compared with the PD model group, the T content increased and FSH decreased in the GSPD model group (all P < 0.05). Compared with each corresponding model group, the FSH content decreased (P < 0.01) and LH increased in the GS medication group; the T content increased, E2 and LH decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in the PD medication group; the T content decreased (P < 0.01), GnRH, E2, FSH, and LH increased (P < 0. 05, P < 0.01) in the GSPD medication group.There exist different degrees of abnormal function of the gonad axis in the GS, PD, and GSPD models. CSD had certain regulatory effect on the 3 syndromes. Of them, it showed a more comprehensive role in improving the gonad function axis. Results of this experiment had provided the experimental evidence for higher correlation between CSD and GSPD syndrome.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Animal
