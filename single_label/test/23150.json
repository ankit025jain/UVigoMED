{"id":23150,"title":"[Mutual role of factors of endotoxicosis and intra-abdominal hypertension syndrome in pathogenesis of abdominal sepsis].","abstract":"The mutual role of the main factors of endotoxicosis and intraabdominal hypertension syndrome (IHS) were studied in pathogenesis of abdominal sepsis, basing on analysis of the treatment results in 156 patients, suffering this disease. The contents of neutrophils, macrophages, interleukins (IL-6, IL-10) were studied in peritoneal exudate as the indices of the source of inflammation in abdominal cavity. There was established the mutual strengthening of the endotoxicosis and IHS factors, what causes the clinical signs of the organ dysfunction, determines the course severity and outcome of pathological process in the organism. Such approach to pathogenesis of abdominal sepsis permits in time and adequately to elaborate the certain program of treatment in the patients.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501962","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.760471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.530897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.125579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Mutual Broadcasting System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Broadcasting_System"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
