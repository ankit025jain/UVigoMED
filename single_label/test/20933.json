{"id":20933,"title":"Re-examination of immune response and estimation of anti-Vi IgG protective threshold against typhoid fever-based on the efficacy trial of Vi conjugate in young children.","abstract":"The capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Vi antigen, is an essential virulence factor and a protective antigen. Similar to other polysaccharide vaccines, the protective action of Vi, both to the polysaccharide alone or when presented as a conjugate, is mediated by serum IgG Vi antibodies. The evaluation of Vi capsular polysaccharide based vaccines to prevent typhoid fever would be significantly facilitated by the identification of a \"protective level\" of serum antibodies to Vi antigen.The protective level of anti-Vi IgG against typhoid fever was derived from the protective efficacy and immune response of a Vi-rEPA conjugate vaccine efficacy trial. The estimation was derived by two methods: correlation of the percent efficacy and the antibody distribution profile in the vaccine group at a given period of observation, and use of the relative ratio of anti-Vi IgG levels between the vaccine and placebo groups greater or equal to the Relative Risk of typhoid fever used in the efficacy determination.Both methods predicted a similar range of a minimum protective level of anti-Vi IgG between 1.4 and 2.0?g/ml (short term threshold). When applying a protective threshold of 10?g/ml at 6 months post immunization, an IgG level in excess of 1.4?g/ml was achieved by 90% of children at 46 months post immunization, consistent with an 89% level of protection over the duration of the study. We thus suggest that the proportion of children with Vi IgG>10?g/ml (long term threshold) 6 months after immunization may reflect the proportion protected over at least a 4 year period.The current assignment of an anti-Vi IgG protective level may be of value when evaluating vaccine performance of future Vi conjugate vaccines.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630869","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.417227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Salmonella enterica","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica"},{"name":"Polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide_encapsulated_bacteria"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
