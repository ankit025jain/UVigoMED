{"id":3264,"title":"Kikuchi's disease--a rare cause of lymphadenopathy and fever.","abstract":"Kikuchi's disease is a rare, benign, self-limited disorder, characterised clinically by fever and tender regional lymphadenopathy. It has been reported worldwide and is particularly common in people of Asian descent. The cause of Kikuchi's disease is unknown. It predominantly affects young females and can closely mimic several infectious and immunological conditions. Histopathologic features of lymph nodes in Kikuchi's disease are characteristic and permit differentiation of this benign condition from lymphomas, systemic lupus erythematosus and infectious lymphadenopathies. We report a female patient presenting with fever and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. She was being treated for tubercular lymphadenitis and was referred after she developed a transient hepatitis and a skin rash following treatment with anti-tubercular drugs. An excisional biopsy of the lymph node revealed histiocytic necrotising lymphadenitis, consistent with Kikuchi's disease. A brief review of the pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of Kikuchi's disease is presented.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25327096","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.784281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histiocyte","weight":0.516127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocyte"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.255316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
