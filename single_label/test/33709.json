{"id":33709,"title":"Effects of early intervention on mental or neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions in children born low birthweight or preterm: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between early intervention and mental or neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions of children born low birthweight (LBW) or preterm.The meta-analysis included 16 studies that yielded 97 effects. Q and IÂ² values were used to determine heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's regression intercept test and a funnel plot.The association between early intervention and either mental or neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions yielded a significant but small effect size (d = .219, p < .0001). Heterogeneity was statistically insignificant.Participation in early intervention programs addressing mental or neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions in children born LBW or preterm results in significant improvements in these areas.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797190","annotations":[{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Funnel plot","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_plot"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.358296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Leg before wicket","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/219"},{"name":"Funnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Early childhood intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_intervention"},{"name":"Plot (graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(graphics)"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Test preparation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_preparation"}]}
