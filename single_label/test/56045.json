{"id":56045,"title":"Age-related changes in anterior, posterior, and total corneal astigmatism.","abstract":"To evaluate age-related changes in anterior, posterior, and total corneal astigmatism by comparing simulated keratometric astigmatism to total corneal astigmatism.Corneal topography of the anterior and posterior surfaces was evaluated using three-dimensional optical coherence tomography in 419 patients with normal eyes (218 men and 201 women) with ages ranging from 8 to 93 years (mean ± standard deviation: 49.5 ± 23.1 years). Keratometric astigmatism was calculated using the keratometric index (1.3375) and radius of the anterior corneal curvature; anterior and posterior corneal curvature measurements were used to calculate total corneal astigmatism.The keratometric and total astigmatism were 1.08 ± 0.71 diopters (D) and 1.03 ± 0.69 D, respectively. Vector analysis revealed a mean difference between keratometric and total astigmatism of 0.24 ± 0.09 D, which showed a significant correlation to age (P < .0001). In eyes with with-the-rule astigmatism, keratometric astigmatism overestimated total astigmatism. In eyes with against-the-rule astigmatism, keratometric astigmatism underestimated total astigmatism.The anterior corneal surface shifts from with-the-rule to against-the-rule astigmatism with aging, whereas the posterior corneal surface remains as against-the-rule astigmatism in most cases. The variation in the anterior astigmatism is the most important factor contributing to this change. Total corneal astigmatism is a better predictor than keratometric astigmatism for selecting toric intraocular lenses.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763724","annotations":[{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.45968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.430832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.381559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.355601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Vector calculus","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.286474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.281944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Euclidean vector","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Torus","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Corneal topography","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_topography"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0193971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"}]}
