{"id":53507,"title":"The effect of ileal interposition surgery on enteroendocrine cell numbers in the UC Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus rat.","abstract":"To investigate the short-term effect of ileal interposition (IT) surgery on gut morphology and enteroendocrine cell numbers in the pre-diabetic UC Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus (UCD-T2DM) rat.Two-month old male UCD-T2DM rats underwent either sham (n=5) or IT (n=5) surgery. Intestines were collected 1.5months after surgery. The jejunum, ileum and colon regions were processed for histochemical and immunohistochemical labeling and stereological analyses of changes in gut morphometry and number of enteroendocrine cells.Stereological analysis showed that intestinal volume, luminal surface area and the number of all chromogranin A-positive enteroendocrine cells were markedly increased in the IT rats compared with sham-operated animals. Subanalyses of the glucagon-like peptide 2, cholecystokinin, serotonin cells and the neurotensin immunoreactive sub-pool of enteroendocrine cells in the IT region revealed an increase in numbers across phenotypes. However, the density of the different cell types varied.IT surgery in the UCD-T2DM rat leads to rapid alterations in gut morphometry and an increase in the number of enteroendocrine cells. This effect may potentially explain why IT surgery delays the onset of type 2 diabetes in the UCD-T2DM rat.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512816","annotations":[{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.751649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.473183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.353845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Neurotensin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotensin"},{"name":"Enteroendocrine cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"University of California, Davis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis"},{"name":"Granin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granin"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
