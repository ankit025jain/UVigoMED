{"id":77376,"title":"[Preventing work-related health problems: the work of the ergonomist].","abstract":"Preventing work-related health problems is an important aspect when considering clinical symptoms. Analysing a person's professional activity is a complex task. The ergonomist intervenes to understand the details of the organisational, environmental and cognitive structures that influence health. The case of a pre-school educator with back pain is presented here as an example of how such a situation is studied and concrete solutions instated. Health preservation strategies, facilitating factors and barriers were identified, which led to a reduction in straining, improved organisation of tasks and achievement of educational goals.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930153","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.721059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Teacher","weight":0.49308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Concrete","weight":0.262007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Schema (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)"}]}
