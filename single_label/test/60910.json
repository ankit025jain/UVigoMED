{"id":60910,"title":"A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of IV iron supplementation for anemia of traumatic critical illness*.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of IV iron supplementation of anemic, critically ill trauma patients.Multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Four trauma ICUs.Anemic (hemoglobin < 12?g/dL) trauma patients enrolled within 72 hours of ICU admission and with an expected ICU length of stay of more than or equal to 5 days.Randomization to iron sucrose 100?mg IV or placebo thrice weekly for up to 2 weeks.A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Baseline iron markers were consistent with functional iron deficiency: 134 patients (89.3%) were hypoferremic, 51 (34.0%) were hyperferritinemic, and 64 (42.7%) demonstrated iron-deficient erythropoiesis as evidenced by an elevated erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration. The median baseline transferrin saturation was 8% (range, 2-58%). In the subgroup of patients who received all six doses of study drug (n = 57), the serum ferritin concentration increased significantly for the iron as compared with placebo group on both day 7 (808.0?ng/mL vs 457.0?ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.01) and day 14 (1,046.0?ng/mL vs 551.5?ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between groups in transferrin saturation, erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration, hemoglobin concentration, or packed RBC transfusion requirement. There was no significant difference between groups in the risk of infection, length of stay, or mortality.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797376","annotations":[{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.857798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.839721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Erythropoiesis","weight":0.704782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoiesis"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.669087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Transferrin saturation","weight":0.572781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin_saturation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Protoporphyrin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoporphyrin"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Zinc protoporphyrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_protoporphyrin"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
