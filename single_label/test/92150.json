{"id":92150,"title":"Microfracture technique versus osteochondral autologous transplantation mosaicplasty in patients with articular chondral lesions of the knee: a prospective randomized trial with long-term follow-up.","abstract":"To compare long-term functional and radiological outcome following microfracture technique (MF) versus osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) mosaicplasty for treating focal chondral lesions of the knee.Twenty-five patients (mean age 32.3 years, SD 7.7) with a full-thickness (International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 or 4) chondral lesion of the articulating surface of the femur were randomized to either MF (n = 11) or OAT mosaicplasty (n = 14). At a median follow-up of 9.8 years (range 4.9-11.4), the patients were evaluated using Lysholm score (n = 25), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS, n = 25), isokinetic quadriceps measurement and hamstring strength measurement (n = 22) and standing radiographs (n = 23).There were no significant differences in Lysholm score, KOOS, isokinetic muscle strength or radiographic osteoarthritis between MF-treated patients and OAT mosaicplasty-treated patients at follow-up. Mean Lysholm score at follow-up was 69.7 [95% confidence interval (CI), 55.1-84.4] for the MF group and 62.6 (95% CI, 52.6-72.6) for the OAT mosaicplasty group.At long-term follow-up, there were no significant differences between patients treated with MF and patients treated with OAT mosaicplasty in patient-reported outcomes, muscle strength or radiological outcome.Therapeutic study, Level II.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441734","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.776726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.720677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Hamstring","weight":0.490067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.369971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Osteochondrosis","weight":0.355108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrosis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Microfracture surgery","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfracture_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"672","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/672"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Ornithine aminotransferase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithine_aminotransferase"},{"name":"Weight training","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"California's 7th State Senate district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_7th_State_Senate_district"}]}
