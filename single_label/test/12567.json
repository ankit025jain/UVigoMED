{"id":12567,"title":"Effect of candesartan on the expression of sclera-choroidal intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in hypercholesterolemic models.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of blocking the angiotensin II AT-1 receptor by the systemic administration of candesartan on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the sclera and choroid of hypercholesterolemic rabbits.New Zealand rabbits were divided into 3 groups, as follows: GI, which was fed a rabbit standard diet; GII, which was fed a hypercholesterolemic diet; and GIII, which received hypercholesterolemic diet plus candesartan. Samples of the rabbits' sclera and choroid were then studied by hematoxylin-eosin staining and histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression.Histological analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sclera and choroid revealed that macrophages were rarely present in GI, and GII had significantly increased macrophage numbers compared to GIII. Moreover, in GII, the sclera and choroid morphometry showed a significant increase in thickness in comparison to GI and GIII. GIII presented a significant increase in thickness in relation to GI. Sclera and choroid immunohistochemical analysis for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression revealed a significant increase in immunoreactivity in GII in relation to GI and GIII. GIII showed a significant increase in immunoreactivity in relation to GI.Candesartan reduced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and consequently macrophage accumulation in the sclera and choroid of hypercholesterolemic rabbits.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519206","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.893794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.631935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.564559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.45573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Sclera","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.272342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.241539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.230777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0697639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Candesartan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candesartan"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Angiotensin II receptor type 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor_type_1"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"}]}
