{"id":80876,"title":"Duffy blood group genotypes among malaria Plasmodium vivax patients of Baoulch population in Southeastern Iran.","abstract":"To determine the distribution of Duffy blood group genotypes in Balouch population as a major ethnic group that living in a sub-tropical area in south East of Iran.In this study, the Duffy blood group FY phenotypes were determined using indirect anti-globulin technique and also genotype by PCR-RFLP in 160 vivax malaria patients and 160 control individuals.The results showed that the most common Duffy genotype was FYA/FYB (46.6%) followed by FYA/FYA (15.3%), FYA/FYO (14.4%), FYB/FYO (11.9%), FYB/FYB (10%) and FYO/FYO (1.9%). In case individuals, frequency of FYA, FYB and FYO alleles were 0.471, 0.431 and 0.097, respectively compaired to 0.444, 0.353 and 0.203, respectively in control (non-infected) group.This data provide evidence that individuals with the FYA/FYB genotype have higher susceptibility to malaria and there are significant associations between Duffy blood group variants and susceptibility or resistance to vivax malaria.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507640","annotations":[{"name":"Iran","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.789718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.765787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.547279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.469816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.389086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.343156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Subtropics","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.126923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"FYB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FYB"},{"name":"Faya (band)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faya_(band)"},{"name":"Baloch people","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"431","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/431"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Duffy (singer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffy_(singer)"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
