{"id":68589,"title":"Readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge among children receiving chronic dialysis.","abstract":"The hospital admission rate for children receiving chronic dialysis has been increasing over the last decade. Approximately one third of patients with ESRD age 0-19 years are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. The objective of this study was to examine hospital readmissions among a cohort of children receiving chronic dialysis to identify factors associated with higher rates of 30-day readmission.A retrospective cohort of index admissions was developed among chronic dialysis patients age 3 months to 17 years at free-standing children's hospitals reporting information to the Pediatric Hospital Information System between January 2006 and November 30, 2010, and followed until December 31, 2010. The primary outcome was any-cause 30-day readmission, and the secondary outcome was 30-day readmission for a cause similar to that of the index hospitalization.In this cohort, 25% of hospital admissions were followed by a readmission within 30 days. Children older than 2 years of age had a lower odds of readmission (odds ratio [OR], 0.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.5 to 0.8). Those receiving hemodialysis had a higher risk of readmission (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4), and admissions >14 days were also more likely to be followed by a readmission (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.0). Approximately 50% of the readmissions were for a similar diagnosis as the index admission; however, the specific admitting diagnosis was not associated with readmission.A significant number of admissions among children receiving long-term dialysis are followed by readmission within 30 days. Further investigation is required to reduce the high rate of readmissions in these children.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509294","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.401943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.291569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.252345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.23456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.0363756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital information system","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"November 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_30"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
