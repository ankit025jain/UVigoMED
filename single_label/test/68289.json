{"id":68289,"title":"Phase III prostate cancer chemoprevention trials.","abstract":"Chemoprevention refers to the use of pharmacologic interventions to delay, prevent, or reverse carcinogenesis with the ultimate goal of reducing cancer incidence. Two large, population-based, phase 3 prostate cancer prevention trials reported that 5-alpha reductase inhibitors significantly reduce prostate cancer risk. However, this class of agents were also associated with increased detection of high-grade prostate cancer. Another large, phase 3 prostate cancer prevention clinical trial showed no benefit for long-term supplementation with the trace element Se, given in the form of selenomethionine, or vitamin E, either individually or in combination. Paradoxically, a significant increase in prostate cancer was observed among men randomized to receive vitamin E alone. A great deal of progress had been made in the field of prostate cancer prevention over the past decade. Future studies will focus on prevention of disease progression in men on Active Surveillance, immunotherapy, mechanistically based drug combinations, and novel biomarkers of risk and benefit.
