{"id":57402,"title":"Comparison of starting ovarian stimulation on day 2 versus day 15 of the menstrual cycle in the same oocyte donor and pregnancy rates among the corresponding recipients of vitrified oocytes.","abstract":"To assess the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer in recipients of embryos from donor oocytes obtained after ovarian stimulation initiated on day 2 (D2) or day 15 (D15) of the menstrual cycle with a secondary end point of comparing the response to stimulation.Prospective observational comparative study.Private in vitro fertilization (IVF) program.Oocyte donors (OD) and recipients.Donors stimulated within 3 months, starting on day 2 or day 15 after bleeding, with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, and GnRH agonist trigger, and oocytes vitrified and later assigned to recipients, followed by routine IVF procedures one to two embryos transferred.Primary outcome pregnancy rate, and secondary outcome number of mature oocytes retrieved.Nine D2 and nine D15 cycles were performed in nine donors. There were no differences between D2 and D15 in the number of mature oocytes obtained (14.0±6.96 vs. 16.89±7.52). To date, 20 recipients have received vitrified oocytes (8 recipients received D2 oocytes and 12 recipients received D15 oocytes). There were no differences between the groups of recipients in fertilization rate (77.3% vs. 76.5%) or number of embryos transferred (1.50±0.53 vs. 1.67±0.65). Twelve clinical pregnancies were obtained. No differences were noted in pregnancy rates (62.5% vs. 58.3%) or implantation rates (41.67% vs. 45%) between recipients of D2 oocytes and recipients of D15 oocytes.Donor oocytes obtained after ovarian stimulation initiated on day 15 of the cycle achieve good pregnancy rates. This information is useful for patients with cancer undergoing fertility preservation.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154677","annotations":[{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.835213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_antagonist"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Fertility preservation","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_preservation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.765459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.709329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.659124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.61914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.491915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D2"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Glass transition","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition"}]}
