{"id":83029,"title":"ESSPRI and other patient-reported indices in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome during 100 consecutive outpatient visits at one rheumatological clinic.","abstract":"A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) and a patient-reported index (ESSPRI) have recently been developed and validated. In our previous study the ESSDAI correlated significantly with serum ?2 microglobulin concentration. We now aim to establish whether the ESSPRI is also associated with serum ?2 microglobulin or with other patient-reported indices.The data on 100 consecutive visits of patients with primary SS (pSS) were reviewed from the patient charts. Patients who had filled out the ESSPRI questionnaire and fulfilled at least four of the revised American-European consensus group criteria for pSS were included. Data were gathered on the ESSPRI (0-10 cm) and on the patient's global health assessment [visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-10 cm] (PGH-VAS), pain-VAS (0-10 cm) and HAQ (range 0-3).The ESSPRI correlated significantly with the PGH-VAS (r = 0.753, P < 0.0001), pain-VAS (r = 0.656, P < 0.0001) and HAQ (r = 0.542, P < 0.0001) (Spearman's correlation). It also correlated weakly with serum ?2 microglobulin (r = 0.214, P = 0.043) and ESR levels (r = 0.235, P = 0.019).The ESSPRI correlated significantly with other patient-reported indices, serum ?2 microglobulin and ESR in patients with pSS. Our results support the view that the ESSPRI is a useful tool in the follow-up of patients with pSS.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464708","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.576707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.559834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.336682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.329769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.276679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"European League Against Rheumatism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_League_Against_Rheumatism"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"753","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/753"},{"name":"235","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/235"},{"name":"656","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/656"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Health assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_assessment"},{"name":"European Volleyball League","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Volleyball_League"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Global health","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
