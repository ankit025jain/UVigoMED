{"id":4075,"title":"Depression in Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"The prevalence of major and minor depression in Parkinson's disease is around 30-40% but, unfortunately, depression remains frequently underrecognized and often undertreated. However, recognition and appropriate treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease is essential for improving the cross-sectional picture and longitudinal course. This review focuses on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and different treatment modalities of depression in Parkinson's disease.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509363","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.30503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.303001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.182844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.0222665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Diplomatic recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition"},{"name":"Major and minor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_and_minor"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Commodore 4040","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_4040"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
