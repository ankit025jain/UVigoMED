{"id":61086,"title":"[Role of CD8(+)T cells and their secreted cytokines in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia].","abstract":"Aplastic anemia(AA) is mostly considered as an immune-mediated bone marrow failure syndrome, characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypoplasia. The pathogenesis of AA is complicated, until now it is not fully understood. Further study on the pathological mechanism will be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of AA. CD8(+) T cells and their secreted cytokines play important roles in the abnormal immunity during the process of AA. Thus, this review focuses on the role of CD8(+) T cells and their secreted cytokines in the pathogenesis of AA.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763045","annotations":[{"name":"Aplastic anemia","weight":0.898275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia"},{"name":"Pancytopenia","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancytopenia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.616811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.273267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"}]}
