{"id":34932,"title":"How are outcomes affected by performing a one-stage combined procedure simultaneously in bilateral developmental hip dysplasia?","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of one-stage combined surgical treatment in children of unilateral and bilateral developmental hip dysplasia diagnosed after walking age.We reviewed 24 patients who underwent one-stage combined surgery for DDH diagnosed after walking age. Group I consisted of 12 patients with bilateral disease who underwent bilateral operation at one operative setting. Group II consisted of 12 patients with unilateral disease. Pre-operatively the hips were classified according to TÃ¶nnis classification. Acetabular dysplasia was evaluated by measuring acetabular index (AI) angles pre-operatively. The acetabular improvements with time regarding AI was noted immediately postoperatively, every six months, and at the final follow-up examination.Mean follow up of the bilateral group I and group II were 54.8 months (range 20-84 months) and 52.6 months (24-80), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between immediate postoperative and final follow up acetabular index improvement rates in both groups. Also there was no significant difference when both hips were compared in group I. The clinical final outcome of both groups and within group I was similar.Simultaneous combined surgery is a challenging but worthwhile procedure for late diagnosed patients with bilateral DDH. The short-mid term outcomes of the procedure are encouraging.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695977","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.647834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.113797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (canine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(canine)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"2080s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2080s"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
