{"id":13534,"title":"Overnutrition induces ?-cell differentiation through prolonged activation of ?-cells in zebrafish larvae.","abstract":"Insulin from islet ?-cells maintains glucose homeostasis by stimulating peripheral tissues to remove glucose from circulation. Persistent elevation of insulin demand increases ?-cell number through self-replication or differentiation (neogenesis) as part of a compensatory response. However, it is not well understood how a persistent increase in insulin demand is detected. We have previously demonstrated that a persistent increase in insulin demand by overnutrition induces compensatory ?-cell differentiation in zebrafish. Here, we use a series of pharmacological and genetic analyses to show that prolonged stimulation of existing ?-cells is necessary and sufficient for this compensatory response. In the absence of feeding, tonic, but not intermittent, pharmacological activation of ?-cell secretion was sufficient to induce ?-cell differentiation. Conversely, drugs that block ?-cell secretion, including an ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channel agonist and an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, suppressed overnutrition-induced ?-cell differentiation. Genetic experiments specifically targeting ?-cells confirm existing ?-cells as the overnutrition sensor. First, inducible expression of a constitutively active K ATP channel in ?-cells suppressed the overnutrition effect. Second, inducible expression of a dominant-negative K ATP mutant induced ?-cell differentiation independent of nutrients. Third, sensitizing ?-cell metabolism by transgenic expression of a hyperactive glucokinase potentiated differentiation. Finally, ablation of the existing ?-cells abolished the differentiation response. Taken together, these data establish that overnutrition induces ?-cell differentiation in larval zebrafish through prolonged activation of ?-cells. These findings demonstrate an essential role for existing ?-cells in sensing overnutrition and compensating for their own insufficiency by recruiting additional ?-cells.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473439","annotations":[{"name":"Receptor
