{"id":13315,"title":"Congenital absence of nitric oxide synthase 3 potentiates cardiac dysfunction and reduces survival in doxorubicin- and trastuzumab-mediated cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Doxorubicin (DOX) and trastuzumab (TRZ) are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents in the breast cancer setting, limited by their cardiotoxic side effects. Among the potential mechanisms for this drug-induced cardiomyopathy, increased production of oxidative stress (OS) through a nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3)-dependent pathway has gained recent attention. The objective of the study was to determine the role of NOS3 and OS in a clinically relevant female murine model of DOX- and TRZ-induced heart failure.A total of 120 female mice (60 wild-type [WT] and 60 NOS3 knockout [NOS3(-/-)]) were treated with either 0.9% saline, DOX, TRZ, or DOX with TRZ (DOX+TRZ). Serial echocardiography was performed for a total of 10 days, after which the mice were euthanized for histological and biochemical analyses.In WT female mice receiving DOX+TRZ, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from 75 ± 3% at baseline to 46 ± 2% at day 10 (P < 0.05). In the NOS3(-/-) group, LVEF decreased from 72 ± 3% at baseline to 35 ± 2% at day 10 (P < 0.05). LVEF was significantly lower in NOS3(-/-) female mice receiving DOX+TRZ than WT mice at day 10 (P < 0.05). Compared with WT, NOS3(-/-) female mice also demonstrated increased mortality after treatment with DOX+TRZ, corroborating the echocardiographic findings. Histological analysis demonstrated increased myofibrillar degradation and loss of cell integrity in NOS3(-/-) female mice treated with DOX+TRZ. There was increased generation of oxidized phosphatidylcholine, a marker of OS, in NOS3(-/-) female mice receiving DOX+TRZ compared with control mice.Congenital absence of NOS3 potentiates the cardiotoxic side effects of DOX+TRZ in an acute female murine model of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Animal
