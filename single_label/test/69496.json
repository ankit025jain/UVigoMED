{"id":69496,"title":"Diabetes complications and adverse health outcomes after coronary revascularization.","abstract":"To examine effects of diabetes complications on health outcomes following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), comparing outcomes for patients with diabetes complications to those without diabetes complications.Retrospective analysis of discharge data for 61,566 patients with diabetes age 45 or older who had CABG or PCI in 2007 in United States community hospitals, using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Analysis included propensity score-adjusted logistic regression.Of all patients, 21.2% of the weighted sample had diabetes complications. Older patients, Blacks and Hispanics, and those with greater illness severity were more likely to have diabetes complications. Unadjusted rates of in-hospital mortality, postoperative stroke, and renal failure were higher for patients with diabetes complications (rate ratios 2.2, 1.8, and 9.8, respectively; all p<0.0001). In adjusted results, having diabetes complications was associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, OR 1.62, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.37-1.91) and renal failure (OR 3.03, CI 1.71-5.39). Compared to CABG, PCI was associated with extra risk of postoperative renal failure for those with diabetes complications.Among patients with diabetes having revascularization, those with diabetes complications have higher risks of in-hospital death and renal failure irrespective of having CABG or PCI.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440091","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.91239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.812073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.748886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.688919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.641068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.614156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.393623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.35508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.256173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.170028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.159466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Gulf War syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War_syndrome"}]}
