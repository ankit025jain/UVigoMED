{"id":81993,"title":"[Tactics of tracheal intubation in patient with tumor of the tongue base].","abstract":"Anatomic deformations can cause complications during the tracheal intubation in the maxillofacial surgery and otorhinolaryngology. The article deals with a clinical case of tracheal intubation in a patient with the anatomic deformations. Successful tracheal intubation was performed in the patient in conditions of conscious and spontaneous breathing under the local anaesthesia, when a fibreoptic bronchoscopy was not available. Furthermore the article briefly discusses techniques of the tracheal intubation in conditions of anatomic deformations of the upper airways and methods of local anaesthesia for the guttur and hypopharynx.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749314","annotations":[{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.798509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypopharynx","weight":0.631839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopharynx"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.559834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.391214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.0544059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"}]}
