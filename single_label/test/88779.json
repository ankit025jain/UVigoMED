{"id":88779,"title":"Endoscopic repair of tears of the superficial layer of the distal triceps tendon.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results after endoscopic repair of partial superficial layer triceps tendon tears.Fourteen patients treated surgically between July 2005 and December 2012 were studied prospectively for 12 months. Indication for surgery was a partial detachment of the triceps tendon from the olecranon that was proved by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all cases. Ten of these patients had chronic olecranon bursitis. All patients were treated with endoscopic surgery including bursectomy and repair of the distal triceps tendon with double-loaded suture anchors. Clinical examination of the patients as well as functional and subjective scores (Mayo Elbow Performance Index [MEPI], Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score [Quick DASH]) were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 and 12 months. An isokinetic strength measurement and MRI were performed preoperatively and 12 months after surgery.All 14 patients were completely evaluated. The MEPI and Quick DASH Score improved significantly after the repair at all postoperative examinations. The MEPI gained 29 points, up to 96 points at last follow-up (P < .05), and the Quick DASH Score went down 15.6 points after 12 months to 4.5 points (P < .05). Maximum extension power improved 55.8%, up to 94.7% at last follow-up compared with the contralateral side. UsingÂ MRI, we found one reruptured partial tear of the triceps tendon that did not require revision surgery.Although triceps tendon ruptures are generally uncommon, partial superficial tears might be more common than previously described. Once the diagnosis is made, endoscopic repair is a method leading to good clinical results with improved function of the affected elbow.Endoscopic repair of superficial tears of the triceps tendon is able to restore function and strength and leads to excellent clinical results after 1 year. Strength recovers to nearly that of the contralateral side, and serious complications appear to be infrequent.Level IV, therapeutic case series.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794569","annotations":[{"name":"Bursectomy","weight":0.889068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursectomy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.763676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.75024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Bursitis","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursitis"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.589761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.570497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.517952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.140979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Olecranon","weight":0.106657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olecranon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Triceps brachii muscle","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_brachii_muscle"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Physical strength","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_strength"},{"name":"Tendinosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinosis"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Middle East Partnership Initiative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Partnership_Initiative"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Weight training","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training"}]}
