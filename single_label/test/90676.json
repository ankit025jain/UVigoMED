{"id":90676,"title":"[Pneumocephalus as a rare complication of general anesthesia].","abstract":"This article reports a case of massive postoperative pneumocephalus in a patient following general anesthesia for a urological procedure. The patient had sustained a severe head injury more than 10 years ago with long-term treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) including decompressive craniectomy, tracheostomy followed by rehabilitation, decanulation and cranioplasty. The patient recovered but suffered severe hemiparesis and mild neurocognitive deficits. Immediately after the current operation the patient was disoriented and did not recover in an appropriate interval. A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan revealed massive intracranial air and frontobasal skull defects. After frontobasal reconstruction, removal of an old lumboperitonal shunt and placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, intracranial air was no longer observed. In summary a frontobasal injury may become symptomatic many years after injury, especially when face mask ventilation with positive pressure is applied during surgical interventions.
