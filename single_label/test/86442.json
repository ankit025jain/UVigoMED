{"id":86442,"title":"Influence of thyroid transcription factor-1 on fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer.","abstract":"To assess the correlation between thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1) protein expression in primary tumors from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, and to determine its effect on survival outcomes.We categorized 112 patients with NSCLC according to TTF1 expression (TTF1(+): n=59, TTF1(-): n=53), and retrospectively determined whether positron-emission topography measurements, including standardized uptake values [mean (SUVm) and maximum (SUVmax)], metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and other clinical factors could predict progression-free (PFS) or overall (OS) survival of these patients.The SUVm, SUVmax, MTV, and TLG values were lower in the TTF1(+) group; their survival outcomes were also better. The SUVm, SUVmax, and TLG values were good prognostic indicators for OS and PFS in this group.Primary NSCLC tumors expressing TTF1 had lower FDG uptake than those that did not and this was a good prognostic indicator.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778062","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.730474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.245669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.217421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"MTV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV"},{"name":"NK2 homeobox 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK2_homeobox_1"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
