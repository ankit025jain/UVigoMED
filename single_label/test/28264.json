{"id":28264,"title":"ST-segment elevation in patients with cocaine abuse and chest pain.","abstract":"Use of cocaine may complicate the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and may influence treatment strategy. Patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be questioned about the use of cocaine. Initial management of cocaine users presenting with chest pain and ST segment elevation should include administration of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Assessment for resolution of chest discomfort and ECG changes should be undertaken before fibrinolytic therapy or angiography is considered. We present a case of patient with chest pain (CP) and ST elevation after cocaine use, whose symptoms and ST changes promptly resolved after medical therapy. Our case highlights the importance of medical therapy in patient with CP and ST elevation after cocaine abuse, before activating cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent angiography.
