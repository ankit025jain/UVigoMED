{"id":62889,"title":"Primary distal femur T-cell lymphoma after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for chronic myeloid leukaemia: a rare case report and literature review.","abstract":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders originating from T lymphocytes are a rare complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) that are not usually associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. A male patient diagnosed at the age of 15 years with chronic myeloid leukaemia (in the chronic phase) was initially treated with oral hydroxyurea. The disease entered an accelerated phase when the patient was 22 years old. Complete remission was achieved after one course of homoharringtonine and cytarabine. The patient then underwent human leucocyte antigen-matched sibling donor allo-HSCT. Just over 6.5 years after the allo-HSCT, a second primary tumour was located in the distal femur and diagnosed as T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage IV, group B). This was treated with various chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens, but the outcomes were poor and the disease progressed. The T-cell lymphoma invaded many sites, including the skeleton, spleen and skin, and the patient died within 8 months of the diagnosis. This current case report highlights the need for the early detection and prevention of subsequent primary malignancies after allo-HSCT.
