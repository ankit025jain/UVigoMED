{"id":63224,"title":"IKK-dependent activation of NF-?B contributes to myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1.","abstract":"The product of the Ph chromosome, the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase activates diverse signaling pathways in leukemic cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph(+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Previous studies showed that nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) is activated in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells, but the mechanism of activation and importance of NF-?B to the pathogenesis of BCR-ABL1-positive myeloid and lymphoid leukemias are unknown. Coexpression of BCR-ABL1 and a superrepressor mutant of inhibitory NF-?B ? (I?B?SR) blocked nuclear p65/RelA expression and inhibited the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells and primary BCR-ABL1-transformed B lymphoblasts without affecting cell survival. In retroviral mouse models of CML and B-ALL, coexpression of I?B?SR attenuated leukemogenesis, prolonged survival, and reduced myeloid leukemic stem cells. Coexpression of dominant-negative mutants of I?B kinase ? (IKK?)/IKK1 or IKK?/IKK2 also inhibited lymphoid and myeloid leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1. Blockade of NF-?B decreased expression of the NF-?B targets c-MYC and BCL-X and increased the sensitivity of BCR-ABL1-transformed lymphoblasts to ABL1 kinase inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NF-?B is activated through the canonical IKK pathway and plays distinct roles in the pathogenesis of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias induced by BCR-ABL1, validating NF-?B and IKKs as targets for therapy of Ph(+) leukemias.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464015","annotations":[{"name":"Philadelphia chromosome","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_chromosome"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Retrovirus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Abl gene","weight":0.794642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abl_gene"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.782746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.742683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.644409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.598582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.5654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.407582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.273369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.230397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
