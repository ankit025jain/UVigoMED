{"id":86632,"title":"The association of 5-HT2A, 5-HTT, and LEPR polymorphisms with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"A consensus has not been reached regarding the association of several different gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We performed a meta-analysis to better evaluate the associations between 5-HT2A, 5-HTT, and LEPR polymorphisms, and OSAS.5-HT2A, 5-HTT, and LEPR polymorphisms and OSAS were identified in PubMed and EMBASE. The pooled odd rates (ORs) with 95%CIs were estimated using a fixed-effect or random-effect models. The associations between these polymorphisms and OSAS risk were assessed using dominant, recessive and additive models.Twelve publications were included in this study. The -1438 \"A\" allele of 5-HT2A was identified as a candidate genetic risk factor for OSAS (OR: 2.33, 95%CI 1.49-3.66). Individuals carrying the -1438 \"G\" allele had a nearly 70% reduced risk of OSAS when compared with AA homozygotes (OR: 0.30, 95%CI 0.23-0.40). There was no significant association between 5-HT2A 102C/T and OSAS risk, using any model. The \"S\" allele of 5-HTTLPR conferred protection against OSAS (OR: 0.80, 95%CI 0.67-0.95), while the \"10\" allele of 5-HTTVNTR contributed to the risk of OSAS (OR: 2.08, 95%CI: 1.58-2.73). The \"GG\" genotype of LEPR was associated with a reduced risk of OSAS (OR: 0.39, 95%CI 0.17-0.88).The meta-analysis demonstrated that 5-HTR-1438 \"A\" and 5-HTTVNTR \"10\" alleles were significantly associated with OSAS. The \"S\" allele of 5-HTTLPR and the \"GG\" genotype of LEPR conferred protection against OSAS. Further studies, such as Genome-Wide Association study (GWAS), should be conducted in a large cohort of OSAS patients to confirm our findings.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract
