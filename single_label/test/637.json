{"id":637,"title":"In vitro activity of clinically implemented ?-lactams against Aerococcus urinae: presence of non-susceptible isolates in Switzerland.","abstract":"We analyzed the in vitro susceptibility to several ?-lactams and vancomycin of 80 Aerococcus urinae isolates collected during 2011-2012 in Switzerland. MICs were determined by Etest (bioMérieux) on Müller-Hinton agar with 5% sheep blood and interpreted according to the CLSI and EUCAST criteria set for viridans streptococci. MIC50/90 for penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and vancomycin were 0.016/0.064 mg/l, 0.032/0.064 mg/l, 0.125/0.5 mg/l and 0.38/0.5 mg/l, respectively. Three (3.8%) isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone regardless of the criteria used (MICs ?2 mg/l); one of them was also non-susceptible to penicillin (MIC of 0.25 mg/l) according to CLSI. ?-lactam resistance in A. urinae is a concern and suggests that more studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanisms of such resistance.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25387295","annotations":[{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.775385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.236002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Ceftriaxone","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone"},{"name":"Streptococcus viridans","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_viridans"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"1250","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1250"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_and_Laboratory_Standards_Institute"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"}]}
