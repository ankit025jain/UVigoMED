{"id":45285,"title":"?-catenin is overexpressed in hepatic fibrosis and blockage of Wnt/?-catenin signaling inhibits hepatic stellate cell activation.","abstract":"?-catenin, a core component of Wnt/?-catenin signaling, has been shown to be an important regulator of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Abnormal activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling promotes tissue fibrogenesis. In the present study, the role of ?-catenin during liver fibrogenesis was analyzed and the functional effects of ?-catenin gene silencing in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) using small interfering (si)RNA were investigated. The expression of ?-catenin in human hepatic fibrosis tissues of different grades and normal human hepatic tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry. To inhibit the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway, siRNA for ?-catenin was developed and transiently transfected into HSC-T6 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. ?-catenin expression was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. The expression of collagen types ? and ? was evaluated by qPCR and immunofluorescent staining. Cellular proliferation and the cell cycle were analyzed using a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V staining. A higher expression level of ?-catenin was identified in the patients with high-grade hepatic fibrosis in comparison with that of the normal controls. Additionally, ?-catenin siRNA molecules were successfully transfected into HSCs and induced inhibition of ?-catenin expression in a time-dependent manner. ?-catenin siRNA treatment also inhibited synthesis of collagen types ? and ? in transfected HSCs. Furthermore, compared with those of the control group, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ?-catenin in HSC-T6 cells inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in cell apoptosis. This study suggests a significant functional role for ?-catenin in the development of liver fibrosis and demonstrates that downregulation of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway inhibits HSC activation. Thus, this study provides a novel strategy for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System
