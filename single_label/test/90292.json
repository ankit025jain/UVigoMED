{"id":90292,"title":"Intra-articular osteotomy for malunited articular fractures of the distal end of the humerus.","abstract":"The precarious anatomy of the articular surface of the distal humerus, as well as its meager subchondral bony support and limited soft-tissue attachments, presents enormous challenges for the operative correction of post-traumatic intra-articular deformities. This study presents 8 patients who underwent articular osteotomy with a mean follow-up period of 10.6 years, with an emphasis on functional, patient-rated, and radiographic outcomes.Eight patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 17-60 years) were followed up for a mean period of 10.6 years. The original fracture was a type C variant in 4 patients, a type B unicondylar fracture in 2, and a type B articular shearing fracture in 2. The initial injury was treated operatively in 5 patients and nonoperatively in 3. The osteotomy and reconstruction were performed on average 8 months after injury (range, 6-11 months). The mean preoperative elbow arc of motion was 37°. Two patients had ulnar nerve dysfunction.All the osteotomies healed after the index procedure without evidence of avascular necrosis. Two patients required a second procedure for stiffness. At follow-up, the mean arc of elbow motion improved to 104° (P = .001), with a mean flexion contracture of 26°. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score at follow-up was 13 (range, 1-37); the mean patient satisfaction rating on a Likert scale (from 0 to 10) was 9.1; and the mean Mayo Elbow Performance Index score was 83 points (range, 70-100 points). Grade II osteoarthritic changes were seen in 3 patients, grade I in 3, and grade 0 in 2.In selected patients with a defined intra-articular malunion, the results of our experience support corrective osteotomy.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630550","annotations":[{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.730262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.710375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.556427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.436252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.429028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.114038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"}]}
