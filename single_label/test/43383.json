{"id":43383,"title":"Outcomes associated with Interstim therapy for medically refractory fecal incontinence.","abstract":"Fecal incontinence is a common, socially debilitating disorder. Initial management involves dietary manipulation with bulking agents or antidiarrheal medications and pelvic floor biofeedback. For patients failing these modalities, traditional surgical approaches are morbid and of variable efficacy. Sacral nerve neuromodulation (Interstim, sacral nerve stimulation) was approved in May 2011 for management of medically refractory fecal incontinence. This report summarizes our experience with this treatment modality.A prospectively maintained database from a colorectal specialty practice was reviewed from December 2011 to June 2013. Patient demographics, incontinence etiology, and medical treatment regimens were reviewed. Outcomes for Interstim placement and surgical morbidity were reviewed.A total of 330 patients were evaluated in the clinic for fecal incontinence during the study period. A total of 33 patients (10%) were offered Interstim therapy. The mean age was 63 (39 to 91) years, and 91% (30 of 33) were female. The etiology of the incontinence was obstetric (81%), rectal prolapse (11%), neurogenic (5%), and iatrogenic (3%). The entire group failed either supplemental fiber or antidiarrheal medications and 73% (24 of 33) failed pelvic floor biofeedback. The mean number of bowel accidents/2-week bowel diary before implant was 19 (9 to 52). After phase I implant, 88% (29 of 33) experienced a successful test phase and proceeded to phase II permanent implant. The mean number of bowel accidents/2-week diary postimplant was 3 (0 to 12). A trend toward less severe episodes of incontinence postimplant was observed. There were no complications associated with either the phase I or phase II implant. There were no phase II failures although 1 patient underwent device explant 9 months after phase II implant for chronic pain.Sacral nerve neuromodulation (Interstim, sacral nerve stimulation) is an effective and efficacious tool for management of medically refractory fecal incontinence that offers a less morbid surgical approach to this problem. Interstim should be considered the first-line surgical approach for medically refractory fecal incontinence.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System
