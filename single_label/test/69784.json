{"id":69784,"title":"Seasonal variation in the month of birth in patients with skin cancer.","abstract":"Month of birth influences the risk of developing several diseases. We investigated the influence of date of birth on melanoma skin cancer (MSC) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence.Enhanced cancer registry data were analysed including 1751 MSC and 15 200 NMSC.People born in February to April showed significantly elevated risks of NMSC compared with those born in summertime.We demonstrated seasonality by date of birth for skin cancer incidence. Neonatal UV exposure may explain this finding.","date":"2014-10-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25290092","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.786982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.744256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.636415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.509266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.330141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.104145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"1751","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1751"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Seasonal variation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_variation"},{"name":"Seasonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality"},{"name":"Birth certificate","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_certificate"},{"name":"Master of Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
