{"id":11630,"title":"Experimental infection of Eurasian collared-dove (Streptopelia decaocto) with West Nile virus.","abstract":"The Eurasian collared-dove (Streptopelia decaocto) has recently experienced a population explosion in North America. It is frequently infected with West Nile virus (WNV). To test the hypothesis that the Eurasian collared-dove is competent to transmit WNV, we experimentally infected two cohorts of doves with two different strains of WNV, CO08, and NY99, respectively. Both virus strains induced a low-level viremia, capable of infecting a small fraction of vector mosquitoes. We suggest that the Eurasian collared-dove plays a relatively insignificant role as an amplifying host for WNV, but it may be important where it is locally abundant.
