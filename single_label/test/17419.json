{"id":17419,"title":"Health-service performance of TB treatment for indigenous and non-indigenous populations in Brazil: a cross-sectional study.","abstract":"Health-service evaluation studies are fundamental for proposing interventions and ensuring improvements in healthcare quality. The present study assesses the performance of health services for indigenous and non-indigenous populations with regard to tuberculosis (TB) control.Interviews with TB patients who underwent treatment between 2009 and 2011 were conducted using the Primary Care Assessment Tool adapted for TB care in Brazil.Primary healthcare (PHC) was the first treatment for most patients at symptom onset, and the diagnoses were typically performed by specialized services. Many patients experienced delayed TB diagnoses that required more than three medical appointments (51% and 47% for indigenous and non-indigenous populations, respectively). Indigenous people received social support, such as basic-needs grocery packages (2.19?±?1.63 vs. 1.13?±?0.49 for non-indigenous people, p?<?0.01) and home visits from health professionals, with an emphasis on the performance of directly observed treatment strategies (DOT; 4.57?±?0.89 vs. 1.68?±?1.04 for non-indigenous people, p?<?0.01).Regardless of the differences between indigenous and non-indigenous populations, the time needed to receive a TB diagnosis was unsatisfactory for both groups. Furthermore, DOT must be performed with better coverage among non-indigenous patients.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885134","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.807966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.669436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.490129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.278019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.222908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Introduced species","weight":0.120262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Grocery store","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store"},{"name":"Indigenous Australians","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"DOT 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_4"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"570","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/570"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"681","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/681"},{"name":"United States Department of Transportation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation"},{"name":"SWAT","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT"},{"name":"Port Harcourt International Airport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt_International_Airport"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Direct imaging","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_imaging"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
