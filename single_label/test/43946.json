{"id":43946,"title":"FOLFIRI® and bevacizumab in first-line treatment for colorectal cancer patients: safety, efficacy and genetic polymorphisms.","abstract":"Over 50% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop metastases. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerance of first-line FOLFIRI®?+?bevacizumab (B) treatment for metastatic CRC, and to assess genetic polymorphisms as potential markers.Adult patients with histologically-proven, non-resectable metastatic CRC and ECOG???2 were included. 14-day cycles consisted of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg), irinotecan (180 mg/m2), bolus FU (400 mg/m2) and leucovorin (400 mg/m2), followed by 46-hour FU infusions (2400 mg/m2). Primary endpoint was response rate according to RECIST criteria. Secondary endpoints were overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survivals, response duration, and toxicity. Associations between clinical data, UGT1A1, thymidylate synthase, VEGFA polymorphisms and PFS, OS and toxicity were analyzed.Sixty-two patients were enrolled (median age 68y). 59/62 patients were eligible and evaluable for response at 6 months: 28 showed partial response (47.5%; 95% CI; 34.3-60.9), 20 stable disease (33.9%) and 11 progression (18.6%). Grade 3/4 toxicities were as follows: neutropenia 16.1%; diarrhea 11.3%; nausea-vomiting 1.6%. Median response duration was 9.5 months (range 2.7-20); median PFS 10.3 months (range 8.8-11.7); and median OS 25.7 months (range 20.2-29.7). 11/59 initially unresectable patients were resectable after treatment. VEGFA polymorphism (rs25648) was associated with better OS (HR: 3.61; 95% CI: 1.57-8.30).FOLFIRI®?+?bevacizumab is active with good response rate, long median OS, and a good safety profile. A VEGFA polymorphism might have a prognostic value in this malignancy.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758527","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Folinic acid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folinic_acid"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.806321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1","weight":0.798483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_glucuronosyltransferase_1_family,_polypeptide_A1"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.763568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.651252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.606052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glucuronosyltransferase","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronosyltransferase"},{"name":"FOLFIRI","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFIRI"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.295315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.281358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Thymidylate synthase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidylate_synthase"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cooperative_Oncology_Group"},{"name":"Thymidine monophosphate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
