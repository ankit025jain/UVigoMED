{"id":86971,"title":"Measles in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"In 1998 Poland, along with all other Member States in the WHO European Region, implemented Measles Elimination Program coordinated by WHO. It requires achieving and maintaining very high vaccine coverage (>95%), recording all cases and suspected cases of measles, and laboratory testing of all suspected measles cases in the WHO Reference Laboratory. In Poland it is a Laboratory of Department of Virology, NIPH-NIH.To assess epidemiological situation of measles in Poland in 2012, including vaccination coverage in Polish population, and Measles Elimination Program implementation status.The descriptive analysis was based on data retrieved from routine mandatory surveillance system and published in the annual bulletins \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\" and \"Vaccinations in Poland in 2012\", and measles case-based reports from 2012 sent to the Department of Epidemiology NIPH-NIH by Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations.In total, there were 70 measles cases registered in Poland in 2012 (incidence 0.18 per 100 000). The highest incidence rate was observed among infants (2.08 per 100 000) and children aged 1 year (2.47 per 100 000). In 2012, 37 cases (52,9%) were hospitalized due to measles. No deaths from measles were reported. Vaccination coverage of children and youth aged 2-11 years ranged from 83.6% do 99.6% (primary vaccination in children born in 2011-2006) and from 76.6% do 96.7% (booster dose in children born in 2003-2001). Performance of the surveillance system was insufficient with only 127 measles-compatible cases reported in 2012 (33% of expected reports). Fifty cases (71%) were confirmed by IgM ELISA test.The epidemiological situation of measles deteriorated in 2012 in comparison to proceding year. The results indicate a need to further promote Measles Elimination Program in Poland, maintain the high immunisation coverage and improve measles surveillance system.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135496","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.901493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Measles","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.545074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.513988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.489444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.269419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.23094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.191014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Poles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"UNESCO","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO"}]}
