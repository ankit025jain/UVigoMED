{"id":16537,"title":"Clinical and economic impact of a quality improvement initiative to enhance early recognition and treatment of sepsis.","abstract":"Studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness of sepsis screening tools and methods to improve the time from diagnosis to antibiotic administration are needed to improve sepsis-related outcomes.To evaluate the clinical and economic impact of a sepsis quality improvement initiative to improve early recognition and treatment of sepsis.A retrospective observational study of adults with sepsis was performed in a 433-bed tertiary medical center. Baseline data were collected for 181 patients with sepsis diagnosis-related group (DRG) coding assignments from July through September 2013. The intervnetion group included 216 patients from October through December 2013. A First-Dose STAT Antibiotic policy was developed, and nurses were instructed to complete an electronic sepsis screening tool once per shift. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included overall LOS and cost per case.Nonsignificant decreases in overall LOS (7.43 ± 5.68 days vs 6.77 ± 5 days; P = 0.138) and in-hospital mortality (13.8% vs 8.8%; P = 0.113) were observed in patients with sepsis DRGs. Early recognition and treatment contributed to significant reductions in ICU LOS (5.85 ± 4.38 days vs 4.21 ± 3.64 days; P = 0.003) and total cost per case ($14 378 vs $12 311; P = 0.033). The percentage of highest disease-severity DRG coding assignments decreased from 7.9% to 0%.Strategies to improve early recognition and treatment of sepsis, including routine use of an electronic sepsis screening tool and implementation of a First-Dose STAT Antibiotic policy, contributed to significant reductions in ICU LOS and cost per case.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982314","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.580649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.429984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.387123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.262543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"378","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/378"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"311 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/311_(band)"},{"name":"Diagnosis-related group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis-related_group"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Medical classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_classification"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Total cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
