{"id":84266,"title":"Esomeprazole treatment of frequent heartburn: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.","abstract":"To determine the efficacy of a 14-day regimen of esomeprazole 20 mg for the treatment of frequent heartburn in subjects who are likely to self-treat with over-the-counter medications without consulting a health care provider.The percentage of heartburn-free 24-hour days over 14 days was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in subjects receiving esomeprazole 20 mg compared with placebo in study 1 (N = 331; 46.13% vs. 33.07%, respectively) and study 2 (N = 320; 48.00% vs 32.75%, respectively). Significantly more subjects treated with esomeprazole 20 mg had heartburn resolution over 14 days and in the first and final weeks compared with placebo. Within the first 4 days, the proportion of subjects with heartburn-free days was significantly greater with esomeprazole 20 mg versus placebo. Treatment was generally well tolerated, with a safety pattern consistent with the known profile for esomeprazole.A 14-day regimen of esomeprazole 20 mg once daily was effective for treating frequent heartburn in subjects who are likely to self-treat with over-the-counter medications.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141241","annotations":[{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Esomeprazole","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Heartburn","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"331","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/331"},{"name":"320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/320"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 14","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_14"}]}
