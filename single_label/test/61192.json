{"id":61192,"title":"[Expression of leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 in children with immune thrombocytopenia].","abstract":"To study the expression of leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1(LAIR-1) in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), in order to explore the possible role of LAIR-1 in the pathogenesis of childhood ITP.Expression levels of LAIR-1 on CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells and CD19(+)CD20(+) B cells of peripheral blood were measured in 40 children with ITP by flow cytometry. Serum level of solubility LAIR-1 (sLAIR-1) was measured using ELISA. Real-time PCR was used to measure LAIR-1 mRNA expression. Thirty-two healthy children served as the control group.The percentages of CD19(+)CD20(+) B cells in the ITP group were significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the percentage of CD4(+) T cells in the ITP group was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels of LAIR-1 on CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells were significantly lower in the ITP group than in the control group (P<0.05). Serum sLAIR-1 level and LAIR-1 mRNA expression in the ITP group significantly increased compared with the control group (P<0.05).LAIR-1 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells decreases and serum sLAIR-1 level increases in children with ITP, suggesting that LAIR-1 may play an important role in immune imbalance in these children.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750832","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.40936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
