{"id":92204,"title":"Effects of hyperbaric oxygen on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and spinal cord edema after spinal cord injury.","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and spinal cord edema after acute spinal cord injury (SCI).Ninety-six healthy adult Sprague ? Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham, sham + HBO, SCI, and SCI + HBO. Each group was subdivided into 4 subgroups of 6 rats each: 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 5 d post-injury. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, interleukin (IL-6), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured using ELISA. The water content of the spinal cord was also measured by Elliot equation.MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and spinal cord water content increased significantly in the SCI group compared to those in the sham and sham + HBO groups at different time points after SCI (P < 0.01). The MMP-2 level was significantly different between the SCI and SCI + HBO groups at 72 h after SCI (P < 0.05), while the MMP-9 level was significantly different at 48 h, 72 h, and 5 d (P < 0.05). The water content of the spinal cord was significantly higher in the SCI group at 5 d after SCI (P < 0. 01). MMP-2 (P < 0.05) and MMP-9 (P < 0.01) levels were positively correlated with spinal cord water content.HBO reduced SCI-induced spinal cord edema, stabilized the blood-spinal cord barrier, and promoted recovery of neuronal function by down regulating the expression of IL-6, MMP-2, and MMP-9 and up regulating the expression of VEGF.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24436993","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.825667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.751733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.717984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.65261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.632099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.557154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hyperbaric medicine","weight":0.497677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"HBO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Water content","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_content"},{"name":"Elliot Reid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Reid"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"Dawley","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawley"}]}
