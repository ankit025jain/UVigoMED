{"id":76885,"title":"[Risk factors of development of hypertension and metabolic abnormalities in practically healthy].","abstract":"In a group of 492 apparently healthy working men (mean aged 55 years) we measured body mass index (BMI), and assessed states of lipid, carbohydrate and purine metabolism, morphological and functional state of cardiovascular system (by transthoracic echocardiography), thickness of intima-media complex of common carotid artery (by ultrasound examination of brachiocephalic arteries). SCORE tables were used for calculation of 10 year risk of fatal heart disease. Most frequent findings were excessive weight (n = 306, 62.2%) and I-II degree obesity (n = 105, 21.34%). Most subjects had elevated level of total cholesterol (n = 323, 65.65%) or low density lipoprotein cholesterol > 3 mmol/l (n = 369, 75.93%). There was significant difference in levels of uric acid between groups of subjects with a BMI < 25 and > 30 kg/m2 (p = 0.00). About one third of men had arterial hypertension. Portion of subjects with grade 1-2 hypertension was significantly higher among persons with BMI above 25 kg/m2. Transthoracic echocardiography showed that increase in BMI was significantly associated with increased left atrial and aortic diameters and thicknesses of left ventricular posterior wall and ventricular septum (p = 0.00) although cardiac contractility and diastolic function were not compromised.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
