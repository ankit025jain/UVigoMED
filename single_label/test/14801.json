{"id":14801,"title":"Genetic diversity of group A rotavirus in swine in Canada.","abstract":"Group A rotaviruses (RVA) in pigs have been poorly investigated in Canada. In a continued effort to fill this gap, ten finisher swine farms in Quebec, Canada, were sampled over a nine-month period. The presence of RVA was detected in healthy pigs on all farms investigated during the entire sampling period. The genotypes detected included G2, G5, G9 and G11; P[6], P[7], P[13], P[27] and P[34]; and I5 and I14. The predominant types were G2, P[13] and I5, which is different from previous global reports. Various fomites were consistently contaminated by RVA, suggesting that a resident viral flora remains in the farm environment and may play a role in the infection of incoming pigs. The results also suggest temporal or geographical specificities regarding strain distribution on pig farms.
