{"id":12436,"title":"MicroRNA profile analysis of a feline kidney cell line before and after infection with mink enteritis virus.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that play a significant role in eukaryotes by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. Recent studies have also shown them to be associated with cellular changes following viral infection. Mink enteritis virus (MEV) is one of the most important viral pathogens in the mink industry. To study the involvement of miRNAs in the MEV infection process, we used Illumina's ultrahigh throughput approach to sequencing miRNA libraries from the feline kidney (F81) cell line before and after infection with MEV. Using this bioinformatics approach we identified 196 known mammalian miRNA orthologs belonging to 152 miRNA families in F81 cells. Additionally, 97 miRNA*s of these miRNAs were detected. As well as known miRNAs, 384 and 398 novel miRNA precursor candidates were identified in uninfected and MEV-infected F81 cells respectively that have not been reported in other mammals. In MEV-infected cells 3 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated and 4 up-regulated including 3 significantly. The majority (12 of 16) of randomly selected miRNA expression profiles by qRT-PCR were consistent with those identified by deep sequencing. A total of 88 miRNAs were predicted to target interferon-associated genes; 6 appear to target the 3'UTR of MEV-specific receptor transferring receptor mRNAs; and 8 to target the MEV mRNA coding region. No miRNAs coded by MEV itself were detected.
