{"id":47575,"title":"My treatment approach to management of the pregnant patient with inflammatory bowel disease.","abstract":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is frequently diagnosed in women of childbearing age. Of paramount concern are questions about the effect of the disease on a woman's ability to conceive and carry the pregnancy safely to term, as well as the effect of the disease and its therapies on the health of the fetus. For health care providers, there is also the issue of medication dose adjustments and management of flares during pregnancy. Growing experience with IBD in pregnancy suggests that most women will have good outcomes; however, concerns and uncertainty remain for both the patient and the physician. This article outlines our approach to the treatment of these patients with respect to preconception counseling and management during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
