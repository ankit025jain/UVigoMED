{"id":22668,"title":"Pure laparoscopic liver resection reduces surgical site infections and hospital stay. Results of a case-matched control study in 50 patients.","abstract":"Laparoscopic resection is an emerging tool in surgical oncology, but its role in liver tumors is far from being universally accepted.We designed a case-matched control study, comparing laparoscopic (LAP) vs. open hepatectomies (OP) performed in the same center during the same period of time. Fifty LAP were performed (34 liver metastases, 7 hepatocellular carcinomas, 2 hydatid cysts, and 5 benign tumors). Cases were compared with 100 OP matched according to: diagnosis, number of lesions, type of resection, age, ASA score, and ECOG performance status. We evaluated intraoperative and postoperative parameters, focusing on morbidity and mortality.Preoperative data were comparable in both groups. Operative features were similar in terms of overall morbidity 18 (36 %) vs. 36 (36 %), p?=?1; intraoperative bleeding, 401 (18-2192) vs. 475 (20-2000) mL, p?=?0.89; pedicle clamping, 37 (74 %) vs. 88 (88 %), p?=?0.55; margin, 0.6 (0-5) vs. 0.65 (0-5) cm, p?=?0.94, and mortality p?=?0.65 for the LAP and OP groups, respectively. There was a significant decrease in surgical site infections 1 (2 %) vs. 18 (18 %) p?=?0.007 in the LAP group. Operative time was longer: 295 (120-600) vs. 200 (70-450) min (p?=?0.0001), and hospital stay significantly shorter: 4 (1-60) vs. 7 (3-44) days, p?=?0.0001 with less readmissions (0 vs. 7 %) in the LAP.In adequately selected patients, laparoscopic hepatectomy is feasible, safe, shortens hospital stay, and decreases surgical site infections.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526221","annotations":[{"name":"ASA physical status classification system","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASA_physical_status_classification_system"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.806541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.647868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.578107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.545789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.381299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Dominican Order","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cooperative_Oncology_Group"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
