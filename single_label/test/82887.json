{"id":82887,"title":"Graft stabilization with cyanoacrylate decreases shrinkage of free gingival grafts.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate three different stabilization methods with regards to the amount of shrinkage in free gingival graft.Forty-five patients were included in three study groups: where stabilization was achieved with conventional technique, cyanoacrylate or microsurgery. In the conventional group standardized 5-0 sutures were used. In the microsurgery group grafts were stabilized with 7-0 sutures and loupe. In the third group, graft was stabilized with cyanoacrylate. Keratinized tissue width, graft area, gingival recession were calculated by a specific software on standard photographs at baseline, 1-, 3-, 6-month follow-ups. Duration of surgery was also recorded. Pain in recipient and donor sites was assessed using visual analogue scale within the first postoperative week.Change in keratinized tissue width was similar in the study groups at all times. Graft shrinkage was significantly less (p < 0.05) in the cyanoacrylate group than the other groups, whereas those in the conventional and microsurgery groups were similar. Significantly less pain in the recipient site was reported by the patients in the cyanoacrylate group (p < 0.05). Duration of surgery was significantly less in the cyanoacrylate group than the other groups (p < 0.05).Less graft shrinkage in the free gingival graft, together with shorter surgery time and less pain in the recipient site obtained in the cyanoacrylate group, suggest that cyanoacrylate may be considered as an alternative for stabilization of free gingival grafts.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494804","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.366471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.260223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.113557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Cyanoacrylate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Receding gums","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receding_gums"},{"name":"Gingival graft","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_graft"},{"name":"Loupe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loupe"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"List of Kodokan judo techniques","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kodokan_judo_techniques"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Late-2000s recession","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Keratin","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"}]}
