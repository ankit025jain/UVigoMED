{"id":61098,"title":"[Expression of WT1 and PRAME gene in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome].","abstract":"This study was aimed to explore the transcription level of WT1 and PRAME two genes in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) and their relationship with bone marrow dysplasia and karyotype. The quantitative expression of WT1 and PRAME transcripts detected by RQ-PCR in the bone marrow samples of 203 MDS patients and 19 aplastic anemia(AA), 6 other benign anemia(BA), 4 paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria(PNH) patients from July 2009 to June 2012 and 14 healthy donors, and in 92 peripheral blood samples. The results showed that WT1 and PRAME expression levels in both BM and PB samples of MDS group were higher than those in normal controls, AA, and BA patients (BM: WT1:P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, PRAME: P = 0.048, 0.000, 0.064; PB: WT1:P = 0.012, 0.000, 0.011, PRAME: P = 0.020, 0.004, 0.003). What is more, this expression in high risk MDS group (RAEB1, RAEB2, MDS-AML) were higher than those in low risk group (RCUD, RCMD, MDS-U) and AA and BA. The WT1 and PRAME mRNA expression levels in PB and BM were well correlated (WT1:r = 0.6028, P = 0.001; PRAME: r = 0.7628, P = 0.000), as well as the WT1 expression levels in BM samples with the Karyotype (P = 0.049). In addition, the same positive rate of WT1 or PRAME expression existed in BM and PB samples of MDS patients. It is concluded that the WT1 and PRAME gene expression levels in both BM and PB samples of MDS patients are higher than those in healthy controls, AA and other benign anemia patients, and increase with the progression of the disease. The WT1 and PRAME transcripts constitute good molecular markers for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis and monitoring minimal residual disease after treatment of MDS. What is more, when bone marrow is not so convenient to get, the transcript levels of PB samples can be detected.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763007","annotations":[{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.856962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.688515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.586374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.443527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.435876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.385378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.365779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
