{"id":14881,"title":"DNA and RNA isolation from canine oncologic formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for downstream \"-omic\" analyses: possible or not?","abstract":"Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues represent a unique source of archived biological material, but obtaining suitable DNA and RNA for retrospective \"-omic\" investigations is still challenging. In the current study, canine tumor FFPE blocks were used to 1) compare common commercial DNA and RNA extraction kits; 2) compare target gene expression measured in FFPE blocks and biopsies stored in a commercial storage reagent; 3) assess the impact of fixation time; and 4) perform biomolecular investigations on archival samples chosen according to formalin fixation times. Nucleic acids yield and quality were determined by spectrophotometer and capillary electrophoresis, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for the following genes: BCL-2-associated X protein, B-cell lymphoma extra large, antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki-67, proto-oncogene c-KIT (c-kit). Two internal control genes (Golgin A1 and canine transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 4), together with direct sequencing of c-kit exons 8, 9, 11, and 17, were used as end points. Differences in DNA/RNA yield and purity were noticed among the commercial kits. Nucleic acids (particularly RNA) extracted from paraffin blocks were degraded, even at lower fixation times. Compared to samples held in the commercial storage reagent, archived tissues showed a poorer amplification. Therefore, a gold standard protocol for DNA/RNA isolation from canine tumor FFPE blocks for molecular investigations is still troublesome. More standardized storage conditions, including time between sample acquisition and fixation, fixation time, and sample thickness, are needed to guarantee the preservation of nucleic acids and, then, their possible use in retrospective transcriptomic analysis.
