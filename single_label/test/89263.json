{"id":89263,"title":"[Local nursing care in burn injuries].","abstract":"Burn injuries are tissue injuries originated as a result of a physical or chemical trauma. They can cause from a mild skin affectation to the total destruction of the affected tissues, depending on various levels of severity. Moreover, if the affected body surface is very large, patient life can be seriously compromised. An estimate 300 people for every 100,000 inhabitants are treated for burn injuries every year in hospitals or social-sanitary centers. In this chapter we aim at clarifying the nursing care for the affected area, once patient's life risk is stabilized and controlled.This care will be based on an adequate approach to local handling of burn injuries, after severity and prognosis have been stated.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738169","annotations":[{"name":"Burn","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.52,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.492411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Chapter (religion)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(religion)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
