{"id":50676,"title":"Thyroid hormones in male workers exposed to urban stressors.","abstract":"The occupational exposure to urban pollution may induce adverse effects on the human health.Plasma levels of thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) of 50 outdoor workers and 50 indoor workers were compared.In the outdoor workers the TSH levels were significantly higher than in the control subjects (p =0.02) while the average of FT3 and FT4 values, was not significantly different compared to the controls (p > 0.05).The differences found for TSH levels between outdoor and indoor workers, though not high, suggest that, due to greater exposure to environmental pollutants, the outdoor workers are more susceptible to the development of function abnormalities of the thyroid gland compared to indoor workers.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763449","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.746624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.426206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.377896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.314018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.29395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.131806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.106006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Thyroid hormone","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Financial Times","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
