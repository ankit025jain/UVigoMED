{"id":4366,"title":"[Monitoring of Enterobius vermicularis infection among children from 2006 to 2010 and SWOT analysis].","abstract":"To understand the infection status and variation tendeNcy of Enterobius vermicularis infection among children at national monitoring spots of soil-transmitted nematodosis from 2006 to 2010, and master the epidemic regularity, so as to provide the evidence for making control strategy and evaluating the control effect.A total of 22 national monitoring spots of soil-transmitted nematodosis were established according to the National Surveillance Program of Soil-Transmitted Nematodiasis (Trial), and the children aged 3-12 years were examined through adhesive cellophane anal swabs, thenthe infection rates of children with different ages, genders, nationalities and education levels were analyzed. In addition, the advantage, disadvantage, opportunity and threat of the monitoring work were analyzed by SWOT analysis. Results: A total of 17 068 children were examined in 22 monitoring spots from 2006 to 2010, and 1 363 of them were found being infected with E. vermnicularis, the average infection-rate was 7.99%, and the infection rates of male and female children were 7.39% and 8.70%, respectivel; the average infection rates in each year were 10.01%, 9.68%, 7.41%, 6.96% and 6.57%, respectively. From 2006 to 2009, the infection rates of E. vermicularis in children in Fujian Province was the highest, which were 56.15%, 53.42%, 37.82% and 49.53%, respectively, but in 2010, the infection rate in Guangdong Province (46.06%) was the highest. The fur- ther analysis demonstrated that the female children, 3-6 age group, Li nationality and children at kindergarten stage had relatively high infection rates. The SWOT analysis showed that the advantage of E. vermicularis monitoring in China was its wide coverage and continuity, and the disadvantage was the relatively small investment from the government, the opportunity was that the national monitoring Spot could drive the monitoring work at the provincial, county and other levels, and the threat was that the work was paid less and less attention to in recent years.Though the infection rate of E. vermicularis in children at national monitoring spots of soil-transmitted nematodosis has been decreased year by year, high-endemic areas still exist, and thus the work on enterobiasis control and prevention still needs to be strengthened.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic
