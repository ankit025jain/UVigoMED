{"id":83082,"title":"Evaluation of UCLA implant-abutment sealing.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of the presence of a prefabricated cobalt-chromium (CoCr) margin in a universal castable long abutment (UCLA) on the sealing capability and fit of the implant-abutment interface.One-hundred twenty external hexagon implants (SIN) were divided into two groups (n=60 each) to receive UCLA abutments from six manufacturers (n=10 each) either with or without a CoCr margin (n=60 each). Abutments were cast and 12 groups were formed: M (Microplant), I (Impladen), S (SIN), Sv (Signo Vinces), T (TitaniumFix), and B (Bionnovation). Sealing was determined by placing 0.7 µL of 0.1% toluidine blue in the implant wells before abutment torquing. Implant-abutment samples were placed into 2.0-mL vials containing 0.7 mL of distilled water to maintain the implant-abutment interface, and aliquots of 100 µL of water were retrieved at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144 hour incubation times for measurement of absorbance in a spectrophotometer, and returned for repeated measurements. Two-way ANOVA (P<.05) and Tukey's test were used. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for observation of the implant-abutment fit.Groups M, Sv, and T without the CoCr margin resulted in complete release of toluidine blue at 1 hour, whereas I, S, and B did so at 3, 24, and 96 hours, respectively. Complete leakage in abutments with the prefabricated margin occurred at 6 hours for S; 24 hours for Sv, T, and B; and 72 hours for M and I. Implant-abutment gaps were observed in all groups. A poorer fit was depicted for groups M and T without the CoCr margin.Complete leakage was observed for all UCLA abutments regardless of the presence of the CoCr margin. Implant-abutment gaps were observed in all groups.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451861","annotations":[{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.845552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.776388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.64973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Hexagon","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.272668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"University of California, Los Angeles","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.174709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Toluidine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluidine"},{"name":"Tolonium chloride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolonium_chloride"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Oil well","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_well"},{"name":"Penning trap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penning_trap"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Sine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Vinces","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinces"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Universe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe"},{"name":"Sievert","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Prefabrication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefabrication"}]}
