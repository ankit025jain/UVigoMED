{"id":44276,"title":"[A case of advanced gastric cancer treated with curative resection after preoperative combined chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1].","abstract":"A 67-year-old woman with epigastralgia was admitted to our hospital and was diagnosed with type 3 advanced gastric cancer with lymph node metastases.The clinical diagnosis was Stage III A(cT3, N2, M0).Since curative surgery was not feasible, we administered preoperative combination chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin(CDDP), and S-1.After 3 courses of chemotherapy, the lymph nodes became undetectable on computed tomography(CT).Distal gastrectomy was performed with curative intent, and the final diagnosis was Stage IIA(ypT3, N0, M0).There has been no recurrence for 1 year and 4 months after the operation.
