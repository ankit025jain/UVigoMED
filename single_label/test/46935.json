{"id":46935,"title":"Anti-miR-197 inhibits migration in HCC cells by targeting KAI 1/CD82.","abstract":"To investigate the metastatic effects and mechanisms of miR-197 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The levels of miR-197 increased in HCC cells and tissues compared with a normal hepatic cell line (LO2) and adjacent nontumorous liver tissues, respectively. miR-197 expression negatively correlated with CD82 mRNA expression in these cell lines and tissues. Dual luciferase reporter assay and Western blot confirmed a direct interaction between miR-197 and CD82 3'UTR sequences. After miR-197 was silenced in HCC cells, CD82 expression increased. In the presence of human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), cells silenced for anti-miR-197 exhibited elongated cellular tails and diminished lamellipodia due to reductions in both ROCK activity and the levels of Rac 1 protein. Downregulation of miR-197 along with the upregulation of CD82 in HCC cells resulted in the inhibition of HCC migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo.Taken together, these data suggest that anti-miR-197 suppresses HCC migration and invasion by targeting CD82. The regulation of the miR-197/CD82 axis could be a novel therapeutic target in future HCC effective therapy.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613834","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.903181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.850105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Hepatocyte growth factor","weight":0.666864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte_growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.170315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Flagellum","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum"},{"name":"Lamellipodium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamellipodium"},{"name":"RAC1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC1"},{"name":"CD82 (gene)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD82_(gene)"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
