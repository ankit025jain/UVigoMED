{"id":51328,"title":"Once-weekly albiglutide versus once-daily liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral drugs (HARMONY 7): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority phase 3 study.","abstract":"As new members of a drug class are developed, head-to-head trials are an important strategy to guide personalised treatment decisions. We assessed two glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, once-weekly albiglutide and once-daily liraglutide, in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs.422 patients were randomly allocated to the albigultide group and 419 to the liraglutide group; 404 patients in the abliglutide group and 408 in the liraglutide group received the study drugs. The primary endpoint analysis was done on the modified intention-to-treat population, which included 402 participants in the albiglutide group and 403 in the liraglutide group. Model-adjusted change in HbA1c from baseline to week 32 was -0·78% (95% CI -0·87 to -0·69) in the albigludite group and -0·99% (-1·08 to -0·90) in the liraglutide group; treatment difference was 0·21% (0·08-0·34; non-inferiority p value=0·0846). Injection-site reactions occurred in more patients given albiglutide than in those given liraglutide (12·9% vs 5·4%; treatment difference 7·5% [95% CI 3·6-11·4]; p=0·0002), whereas the opposite was the case for gastrointestinal events, which occurred in 49·0% of patients in the liraglutide group versus 35·9% in the albiglutide group (treatment difference -13·1% [95% CI -19·9 to -6·4]; p=0·00013).Patients who received once-daily liraglutide had greater reductions in HbA1c than did those who received once-weekly albiglutide. Participants in the albiglutide group had more injection-site reactions and fewer gastrointestinal events than did those in the liraglutide group.GlaxoSmithKline.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703047","annotations":[{"name":"GlaxoSmithKline","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.8309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.797743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.787847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.689819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.685384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Liraglutide","weight":0.476389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Albiglutide","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albiglutide"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"402","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/402"},{"name":"408","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/408"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"359","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/359"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Personalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
