{"id":56860,"title":"Orbital apex syndrome secondary to herpes zoster virus infection.","abstract":"A male patient with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) presented with left exophthalmos, external and internal ophthalmoplegia and decreased visual acuity. A CT scan revealed myositis without significant compression of the optic nerve. Intravenous acyclovir and oral steroids were started with improvement of the symptoms and eventual complete recovery.Orbital apex syndrome is a rare complication of HZO. Multiple pathogenic mechanisms are involved, including a direct cytopathic effect of the virus as in the present case. Early diagnosis and therapy may lead to complete recovery of visual function.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614776","annotations":[{"name":"Aciclovir","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciclovir"},{"name":"Herpes zoster","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.85431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Optic nerve","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.783107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ophthalmoparesis","weight":0.603865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmoparesis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.473737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.399803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cytopathic effect","weight":0.315918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathic_effect"},{"name":"Myositis","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Ophthalmic nerve","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmic_nerve"}]}
