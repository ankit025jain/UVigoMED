{"id":48034,"title":"National and sub-national environmental burden of disease in Iran from 1990 to 2013-study profile.","abstract":"Development of national evidence-based public health strategies requires a deep understanding of the role of major risk factors (RFs) and the burden of disease (BOD). In this article, we explain the framework for studying the national and sub-national Environmental Burden of Disease (EBD) in Iran as a part of the National and Sub-national Burden of Disease (NASBOD) study.The distribution of exposures to environmental RFs and their attributable effect size over 1990-2013 will be estimated through comprehensive reviews of either published or unpublished sources. Statistical modeling will be used to impute missing data in the distribution of RFs exposures for each district-year. National and sub-national BOD attributable to these RFs will be estimated in the following metrics: Prevalence, death, years of life lost due to premature death (YLL), years of life lost due to disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYs). The BOD attributable to the current distribution of exposures will be compared with a counterfactual exposure distribution scenario-here, the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure distribution. Inequalities in the distribution of exposure to RFs will be analyzed and manifested nationwide using geographic information systems.The EBD study aims to provide an official report to Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education, to publish a series of articles on the exposure trends of the selected environmental RFs, to estimate the BOD attributable to these RFs, and to assess inequalities and its determinants in the distribution of exposure to RFs. Iran's territory is large with diverse population, socioeconomic, and geographic areas. Results of this comparative risk assessment study may pave the way for health policy makers to plan more comprehensive and cost-effective evidence-based strategies.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Disorders of Environmental Origin","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444065","annotations":[{"name":"Public
