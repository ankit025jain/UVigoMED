{"id":47807,"title":"Gene profiling and bioinformatics analyses reveal time course differential gene expression in surgically resected colorectal tissues.","abstract":"It has previously been reported that gene profiles in surgically-resected colorectal cancer tissues are altered over time possibly due to the different tissue-acquisition methods and sample extraction timing that were used. However, the changes that occur are still not clearly understood. In the present study, time-dependent changes in gene expression profiling in colorectal surgical specimens were analyzed. Normal and tumor tissues at several time-points (0, 30, 60 and 120 min) were extracted, and RNA quality, microarray experiments, quantitative PCR and bioinformatics clustering were performed. Although RNA integrity was preserved 2 h after resection, inherent increased/decreased gene expression was observed from 30-120 min in approximately 10% of genes. Bioinformatics clustering could not distinguish case-by-case, probably due to gene profiling changes. Irregular changes in gene expression after surgical resection were found, which could be a crucial confounding factor for quantitative analyses.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573535","annotations":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.805725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.773069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.628898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.616326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.409179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.382994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Irregular military","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_military"},{"name":"Surgical pathology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_pathology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
