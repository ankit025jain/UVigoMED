{"id":16532,"title":"[Whirlpool-dermatitis with \"hot hands\"].","abstract":"A 15-year-old boy presented with painful nodules on his palms and discrete pustules on the forearm. Two days earlier he had taken a bath in a new whirlpool.Bacteriological examination of the pustules revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cervical and axillary lymph nodes were inconspicuous.The dermal infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was treated with i.v. piperacillin 4 g/tazobactam 0,5 g twice daily. Furthermore, the patient received 400 mg ibuprofen twice daily per os. Seven days later all symptoms had resolved.Hot tubs are a potential source of cutaneous infections with the gram-negative rod Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most common clinical manifestation of these infections is \"hot tub- or jacuzzi-folliculitis\" with pustules mainly on the trunk and lymphadenopathy. In children and adolescents, the clinical picture may differ, with a predominance of tender reddish nodules on the palms or soles named \"hot hand/hot foot syndrome\". In general, the first-line antibiotic in an infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa is ciprofloxacin but it is not recommended in children and adolescents.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983193","annotations":[{"name":"Piperacillin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperacillin"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Ibuprofen","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.725046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.639889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.639545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.615743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.407222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.306403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.204947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.145669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hot tub","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_tub"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Sole (foot)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_(foot)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
