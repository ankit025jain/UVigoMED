{"id":73552,"title":"Metastases to hernial sac detected on (18)F-FDG PET/CT.","abstract":"The presence of primary or metastatic cancer within a hernial sac is uncommon. Based on the anatomical relation of the tumor to the sac, malignant tumors within hernia sac are classified into 3 groups; intrasaccular, saccular, and extrasaccular. We present F-FDG PET/CT images of 2 cases of hernia sac metastasis, one from non-small cell lung cancer and another from infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma. F-FDG PET/CT was useful in these cases for detection of the metastatic lesion within hernial sac and thus in assessment of total disease burden.
