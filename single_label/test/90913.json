{"id":90913,"title":"Mid-term outcome of patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures following internal fixation through a modified Stoppa approach.","abstract":"This retrospective study presents the mid-term outcome of polytrauma patients with pelvic ring and acetabular fractures operated using a modified Stoppa approach. We examined 32 patients (13 women and 19 men ; mean age 44 years) 24 to 40 months after the trauma. We performed a functional assessment of these patients using Majeed's score. Mean Majeed score was 86.9 +/- 8.22 with a range from 70 to 100. Excellent clinical results were noted in 59% of cases (in 83% of pelvic fractures and 40% of acetabular fractures) and good clinical results in 41% (in 17% of pelvic ring fractures and 60% of acetabular fractures). Fracture healing with anatomical reduction was achieved in all pelvic ring fractures. Healing with anatomic or satisfactory reduction was achieved in 90% of the acetabular fractures.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563971","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.755162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.268178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Fixation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
