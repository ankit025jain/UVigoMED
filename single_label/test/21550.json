{"id":21550,"title":"Cutaneous fungal infection in a neonatal intensive care unit patient: a case report and literature review.","abstract":"Fungal skin infections are not uncommon in healthy, premature or immunocompromised newborns. Healthy neonates usually develop fungal skin infections caused by dermatophytes, Candida and Malassezia species, whereas immunocompromised neonates are more susceptible to skin infections with opportunistic pathogens (Aspergilus, Zygomycetes). Therefore neonatal fungal skin infections can range from generally benign superficial lesions to potentially fatal, deep, necrotic forms with dissemination. We present the case of a premature neonate twin with cutaneous fungal infection in a neonatal intensive care unit. Because there were doubts concerning the correspondence of the clinical features with the cultured species in the newborn, a literature review was performed searching for similar clinical cases.
