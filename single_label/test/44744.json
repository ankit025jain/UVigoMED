{"id":44744,"title":"Does resection of primary lesions show survival benefit for stage IV colorectal cancer patients with unresectable metastases?","abstract":"The aims of the current retrospective cohort study were to compare OS of the primary resection (R-g) and the non-resection group (NR-g) after 2005.Ninety-five patients with stage IV colorectal cancer with unresectable distant metastases were divided into 2 groups; R-g; 37 and NR-g; 58.The only significant difference in clinical factors between the 2 was R0 resection rate (p = 0.007). The MST in R-g was superior to that in NR-g, 30.7 vs. 21.9 months (p = 0.031). After excluding the patients that underwent R0 resection, there was no difference in OS between the 2; however, the MST was 28.6 months in R-g and 17.1 months in NR-g.The advantage of resection of the primary is still unclear and a well-designed randomized Phase III study is expected. However, the current results suggest that resection of the primary lesion before intensive chemotherapy had some benefit for prognosis.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719932","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.772237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.707909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.576714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Roentgenium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roentgenium"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Mountain Time Zone","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Time_Zone"}]}
