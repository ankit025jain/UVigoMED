{"id":73606,"title":"The actual scenario of neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer in developing country: a report of 80 cases of breast cancer from a tertiary cancer center in India.","abstract":"Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an option in patients with large operable breast cancer to facilitate the breast conservation and to downstage the disease to make inoperable breast cancer to operable one. It is also called the window of opportunity; it provides a unique opportunity to derive biological information related to tumor response. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been compared with standard, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with goals of improving survival and facilitating local therapies. Unfortunately, neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not seem to improve overall survival. There is a lack of data from India regarding the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The present study was carried out to assess the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who were started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) at our center for 1 year (August 2012 to July 2013). Case files were thoroughly reviewed, and patient's characteristics (age, pre-/postmenopausal status, family history of breast/ovarian/other cancer), mode of detection, treatment, and histological features were analyzed.Out of 322 patients with breast cancer registered in our institute, 80 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Median age was 45 years. The most common presentation was left-sided breast lump (Lt > Rt) with a median duration of symptoms was 4 months. Postmenopausal patients (53.75 %) were more than premenopausal (46.25 %). Seventy-two patients were stage III and 8 were stage II disease. Bilateral breast cancer was seen in 8 patients. Most common histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma (95 %). Estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone (PR) positive were seen in 47 (58.75 %) patients. Ten patients were HER2 positive and ER/PR negative, and 5 patients were triple positive. Triple-negative patients were 22 (27.5 %). The most common neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocol used was FEC. Clinical response before surgery was CR 13 %, PR 68.68 %, stable disease 11.62 %, and progressive disease 4.65 %. Pathological CR was seen in 6.9 % of tumors. Nodal status at surgery was ypN0-40 %, ypN1-28. 5 %. ypN2-27 %, and ypN3-4.28 %.In a population of predominantly locally advanced patients, NACT with anthracyclines yielded pCR rates comparable to published studies. There were a high proportion of HER2-positive patients, most of whom could not receive anti-HER2 therapy due to financial reasons.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894013","annotations":[{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Breast
