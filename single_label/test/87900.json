{"id":87900,"title":"Diagnostic utility of F waves in clinically diagnosed patients of carpal tunnel syndrome.","abstract":"Sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) of median nerve measured across the carpal tunnel, difference between distal sensory latencies (DSLs) of median and ulnar nerves and difference between distal motor latencies (DMLs) of median and ulnar nerves are commonly used nerve conduction parameters for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). These are having high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Study of median nerve F-wave minimal latency (FWML) and difference between F-wave minimal latencies (FWMLs) of median and ulnar nerves have also been reported to be useful parameters for diagnosis of CTS. However, there is controversy regarding superiority of F-wave study for diagnosis of CTS. So the aim of present study was to compare sensitivity and specificity of median FWML and difference between FWMLs of median and ulnar nerves with that of above mentioned electrophysiological parameters and to find out which parameters are having more sensitivity and specificity, for early diagnosis of CTS.Median and ulnar nerves sensory and motor conduction, median and ulnar nerves F-wave studies were carried out bilaterally in 125 clinically diagnosed patients of carpal tunnel syndrome. These parameters were also studied in 45 age matched controls.Difference between DSLs of median and ulnar nerves, median SNCV and difference between DMLs of median and ulnar nerves were having highest sensitivity and specificity while median FWML and difference between FWMLs of median and ulnar nerves was having lowest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of CTS. So in conclusion F-wave study is not superior parameter for diagnosis of CTS.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968575","annotations":[{"name":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome"},{"name":"Median nerve","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.783491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.740273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Nerve conduction study","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_study"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.606261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.506495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.390351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Nerve conduction velocity","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_velocity"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.315609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Sensory nerve","weight":0.30871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_nerve"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.197971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Vicinal tramway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicinal_tramway"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
