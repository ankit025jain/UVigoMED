{"id":52851,"title":"Evaluation of buspirone on streptozotocin induced type 1 diabetes and its associated complications.","abstract":"We have evaluated the effect of buspirone (1.5?mg/kg/day, p.o.) type 1 diabetes induced cardiovascular complications induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 45?mg/kg, i.v.) in Wistar rats. Various biochemical, cardiovascular, and hemodynamic parameters were measured at the end of 8 weeks of treatment. STZ produced significant hyperglycaemia, hypoinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia, which was prevented by buspirone treatment. STZ produced increase in serum creatinine, urea, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine kinase, and C-reactive protein levels and treatment with buspirone produced reduction in these levels. STZ produced increase in cardiac and LV hypertrophy index, LV/RV ratio, and LV collagen, which were decreased by buspirone treatment. Buspirone also prevented STZ induced hemodynamic alterations and oxidative stress. These results were further supported by histopathological studies in which buspirone showed marked reduction in fibrosis and cardiac fiber disarray. In conclusion, our data suggests that buspirone is beneficial as an antidiabetic agent in type 1 diabetes mellitus and also prevents its cardiac complications.
