{"id":82707,"title":"[The history and scientific development of atraumatic restorative treatment].","abstract":"Atraumatic Restorative Treatment is a minimally invasive treatment modality which is intended to prevent carious lesions and to stop the progression of carious lesions. The treatment modality was developed to preserve carious teeth and was primarily aimed at communities having little or no electricity, piped water and oral healthcare and who have limited financial resources. In 1994, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment was recognised by the World Health Organization. Several systematic studies have demonstrated that Atraumatic Restorative Treatment using high-viscosity glass ionomer cement provides reliable results for one-surface restorations in deciduous molars and permanent (pre)molars. In developed as well as developing countries, more possibilities have been created with this low-cost treatment to improve the oral health of communities who have previously not had access to adequate care.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555251","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.501818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.437547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Water supply","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.360251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.274465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"History","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.217446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Deciduous","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0682051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Ionomer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionomer"},{"name":"Glass ionomer cement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ionomer_cement"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Pipeline transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Building restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_restoration"},{"name":"1994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"}]}
