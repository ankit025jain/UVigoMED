{"id":80685,"title":"Enhanced chemoprophylactic and clinical efficacy of albendazole formulated as solid dispersions in experimental cystic echinococcosis.","abstract":"Cystic echinococcosis is a chronic, complex, and still neglected disease. Although albendazole has demonstrated efficacy, only about one-third of patients experience complete remission or cure and 30-50% of treated patients develop some evidence of a therapeutic response. Different strategies have been developed in order to improve the albendazole water solubility and dissolution rate. The aim of the current work was to investigate the chemoprophylactic and clinical efficacy of an albendazole:poloxamer 188 solid dispersion formulation on mice infected with Echinococcus granulosus metacestodes. Albendazole formulated as solid dispersion had greater chemoprophylactic and clinical efficacy than albendazole alone. The improved in therapeutic efficacy could be a consequence of the increase in the systemic availability of albendazole sulfoxide. The work reported here demonstrates that in vivo treatment with albendazole:poloxamer 188 impairs the development of the hydatid cysts. This new pharmacotechnically based strategy could be a suitable alternative for treating cystic echinococcosis in humans.
