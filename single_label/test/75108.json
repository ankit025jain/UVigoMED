{"id":75108,"title":"Memantine for the prevention of primary headache disorders.","abstract":"To describe the current data evaluating the efficacy and safety of memantine for the prevention of primary headache disorders.A literature search using MEDLINE (1966-July 2014) and EMBASE (1973-July 2014) was conducted using the search terms memantine, headache, migraine, glutamate, and NMDA. References of identified articles were reviewed for additional, relevant citations.All English-language articles dealing with the use of memantine for prevention of primary headache disorders were included.Data from several retrospective reports and 2 prospective clinical trials suggest that memantine may be a useful treatment option for the prevention of primary headache disorders. The majority of available literature focuses specifically on chronic migraine prevention in refractory patients who had failed multiple previous prophylactic therapies. In these patients, 10 to 20 mg of memantine daily reduced the frequency and intensity of migraine headaches and was generally well tolerated, with few adverse events. Data regarding the efficacy of memantine for other primary headache disorders such as chronic tension type and cluster headaches are limited.Although further studies evaluating the efficacy of memantine for prevention of primary headache disorders are warranted, memantine may be a reasonable option, used either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, in the refractory chronic migraine prophylaxis setting.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159002","annotations":[{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.736059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Cluster headache","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.684374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.628038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.465761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid","weight":0.432599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.404048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.304325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Memantine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memantine"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
