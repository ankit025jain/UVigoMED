{"id":30986,"title":"[The relationship between glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta -1727A/T x -50T/C genetic polymorphisms and nicotine dependence].","abstract":"As a help of the mechanism elucidation of nicotine dependence, we studied the relationship between glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) - 3beta -1727A/T and -50T/C genetic polymorphisms, which are reported to be related to bipolar disorder. We genotyped the two polymorphisms in the GSK-3beta gene using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 103 healthy controls (never smokers) and 71 smokers with FTND scores of 3 or above. There is no significant relationship between the polymorphism of GSK-3beta -1727A/T and the nicotine addicts. However, it was shown that GSK-3beta -50T/C polymorphism was significantly associated with the nicotine dependence. There was significantly lower T-allele frequency in the smokers than controls (chi2 (2) = 23.42, P = 0.01; chi2 (1) = 12.17, P = 0.01).","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24427901","annotations":[{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.732324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.546741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"GlaxoSmithKline","weight":0.408251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline"},{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.324541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.282498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"GSK-3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSK-3"},{"name":"Glycogen synthase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_synthase"},{"name":"1727","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1727"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
