{"id":50554,"title":"Metformin-induced thyrotropin suppression is not associated with cardiac effects.","abstract":"Metformin treatment may induce a decrease/suppression in serum TSH levels, mimicking sub-clinical hyperthyroidism (SHT). The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate changes in several electrocardiographic indices in euthyroid subjects with diabetes who, after starting metformin treatment, developed a low serum TSH as compared to patients with SHT resulting from an underlying thyroid disease or TSH suppressive treatment with L-thyroxine.Heart rate, P wave duration, P wave dispersion, QTmax, QTmin and QT-dispersion were assessed in 23 patients with diabetes treated with metformin before and after 6 months of TSH-suppression and in 31 control patients with SHT.No significant changes in electrocardiographic parameters were observed from baseline to the TSH-suppression measurement. A significant difference in P wave duration (102.9 ± 7.4 vs. 92.1 ± 5.8 ms, p<0.001), P wave dispersion (13.1 ± 3.4 vs. 7.1 ± 3.5 ms, p<0.001), QTmax (399 ± 18 vs. 388 ± 16 ms, p=0.024), QTmin (341 ± 14 vs. 350 ± 17 ms, p=0.038) and QT dispersion (49.9 ± 9.6 vs. 30.9 ± 9.2 ms, p<0.001) were observed between the control group with SHT and the group of diabetic patients with low serum levels of TSH.Our results show that the TSH-suppressive effect observed in patients taking metformin is not associated with peripheral markers of thyroid hormone excess, at least at the cardiac level.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776625","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.891139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Thyroid hormone","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Euthyroid","weight":0.798975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyroid"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.797946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.666424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.657294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"P wave (electrocardiography)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_wave_(electrocardiography)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"399","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/399"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Shit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit"},{"name":"388","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/388"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/341"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Dispersion (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)"},{"name":"Q (New York City Subway service)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(New_York_City_Subway_service)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
