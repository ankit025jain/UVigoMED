{"id":68697,"title":"Low hip bone mineral density predicts mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients: a five-year follow-up study.","abstract":"Bone loss is common among hemodialysis patients and contributes to mortality. The association between bone loss and vascular calcification may explain the increased mortality risk. Studies on the association between decreased bone mass and mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients are limited.Eighty-three hemodialysis patients underwent bone mineral density (BMD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) measurements. The relationship between BMD and mortality was analyzed after a 5-year follow-up period.Eighty percent of the patients had reduced hip BMD. In univariate Cox regression analyses, age, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, increased CAC score, increased comorbidity score and decreased hip BMD were associated with mortality. Low hip BMD remained independently associated with mortality after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidity score and CAC score. Patients with BMD in the lowest tertile had the worst survival.Low hip BMD predicted mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients independent of CAC.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503711","annotations":[{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.815539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.792041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.343787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.131703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hip bone","weight":0.0800639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_bone"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Quantile","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
