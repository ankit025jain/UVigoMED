{"id":45061,"title":"Effectiveness of telaprevir or boceprevir in treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis.","abstract":"We investigated the effectiveness of the protease inhibitors peginterferon and ribavirin in treatment-experienced patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis.In the Compassionate Use of Protease Inhibitors in Viral C Cirrhosis study, 511 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and compensated cirrhosis who did not respond to a prior course of peginterferon and ribavirin (44.3% relapsers or patients with viral breakthrough, 44.8% partial responders, and 8.0% null responders) were given either telaprevir (n = 299) or boceprevir (n = 212) for 48 weeks. We assessed percentages of patients with sustained viral responses 12 weeks after therapy and safety. This observational study did not allow for direct comparison of the 2 regimens.Among patients given telaprevir, 74.2% of relapsers, 40.0% of partial responders, and 19.4% of null responders achieved SVR12. Among those given boceprevir, 53.9% of relapsers, 38.3% of partial responders, and none of the null responders achieved SVR12. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with SVR12 included prior response to treatment response, no lead-in phase, HCV subtype 1b (vs 1a), and baseline platelet count greater than 100,000/mm(3). Severe adverse events occurred in 49.9% of cases, including liver decompensation, severe infections in 10.4%, and death in 2.2%. In multivariate analysis, baseline serum albumin level less than 35 g/L and baseline platelet counts of 100,000/mm(3) or less predicted severe side effects or death.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704719","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Boceprevir","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boceprevir"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.679806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.447084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0384911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
