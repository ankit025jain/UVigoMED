{"id":78774,"title":"[Diagnostics of olfactory disorders in the patients with Parkinson's disease and polypous sinusitis with the use of the Sniffin' Sticks test].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was the characteristic of the sense of smell and comparison of its peculiarities in the patients presenting with Parkinson's disease and polypous sinusitis based on the results of otorhinolaryngological examination with the use of the Sniffin' Sticks test. A total of 31 patients with polypous rhinosinusitis (PRS) (18 men and 17 women at the age of 44-58 years ) and 97 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (47 men and 50 women at the age of 50-56 years) were enrolled in the study. It was shown that 85% of the patients with PRS and PD suffered from olfactory disorders. The evaluation of selected parameters determined by the Sniffin' Sticks test demonstrated the impairment of the sense of smell in 48% of the patients with PRS and in 54% of those having PD. The main difference between the two groups was in the odour threshold that was reduced in 97% of the patients with PRS and in 72% of the cases with PD and in the ability to distinguish between odours that was compromised in 37% and 78% of these patients respectively.
