{"id":22657,"title":"[Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in patients with nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia].","abstract":"Moxifloxacin (MFLX) is a respiratory quinolone, and is effective against not only Gram-positive and negative bacteria but also anaerobes. There has been no prospective studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of MFLX in patients with nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP). Therefore, we assessed the efficacy and safety of MFLX in patients with NHCAP. NHCAP patients with mild and moderate severity assessed by the A-DROP system in community-acquired pneumonia guideline proposed by Japan Respiratory Society visited our hospitals from April 2011 to March 2012. Clinical symptoms, chest X-ray films and/or computed tomography, peripheral white and red blood cell and platelet counts, serum CRP, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine were evaluated. Forty patients were eventually evaluated, and average age was 74.1 years old, male/female were 21/19, 92.5% (37/40) of them had one or more comorbidities. Median duration of MFLX administration was 7.1 days (4-15 days). The efficacy of MFLX in all patients was 87.5% (35/40). The efficacies in each age group were 87.9% (aged over 65 years old), 85.7% (aged under 64 years old), and in each pneumonia severity group by the A-DROP system were 91.7% (mild), 85.7% (moderate). Diarrhea and swelling of the breast were observed in one patient (2.5%) after starting MFLX administration. Mild elevated transaminases were observed in three patients (7.5%), and mild renal dysfunction was observed in two patients (5.0%). All abnormally increased levels of transaminases and serum creatinine were recovered after a cessation of MFLX. MFLX is effective and safe in patients with NHCAP.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
