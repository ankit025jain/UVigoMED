{"id":29335,"title":"Understanding PTSD comorbidity and suicidal behavior: associations among histories of alcohol dependence, major depressive disorder, and suicidal ideation and attempts.","abstract":"Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at an elevated risk for experiencing suicidal thoughts and actions. However, a relative dearth of research has examined factors that may impact this relation, such as common co-occurring disorders. Utilizing the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication data, the current study examined comparisons between comorbid PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD) and comorbid PTSD and alcohol dependence (AD) in relation to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. It was hypothesized that comorbid MDD would be associated with an elevated likelihood of suicidal ideation, while comorbid AD would be associated with an elevated likelihood of suicide attempt history. Results indicated that only PTSD-AD was significantly associated with an elevated likelihood of endorsing histories of both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. These findings suggest that AD may be a critical risk factor for acquiring the capability for suicide attempts.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681282","annotations":[{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.634618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.593174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.489449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Failed suicide attempt","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_suicide_attempt"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.313174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
