{"id":55802,"title":"Headache and refractive errors in children.","abstract":"To investigate the association between uncorrected or miscorrected refractive errors in children and headache, and to determine whether correction of refractive errors contributes to headache resolution.Results of ophthalmic examination, including refractive error, were recorded at initial visit for headache. If resolution of headache on subsequent visits was not documented, a telephone call was placed to their caregivers to inquire whether headache had resolved.Of the 158 patients, 75.3% had normal or unchanged eye examinations, including refractions.Follow-up data were available for 110 patients. Among those, 32 received new or changed spectacle correction and 78 did not require a change in refraction.Headaches improved in 76.4% of all patients, whether with (71.9%) or without (78.2%) a change in refractive correction. The difference between these two groups was not statistically significant (P = .38).Headaches in children usually do not appear to be caused by ophthalmic disease, including refractive error. The prognosis for improvement is favorable, regardless of whether refractive correction is required.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804974","annotations":[{"name":"Headache","weight":0.800817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.775558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.500024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.111981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.101738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Telephone call","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_call"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"}]}
