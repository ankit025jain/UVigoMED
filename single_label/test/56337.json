{"id":56337,"title":"Effectiveness of emergency argon laser retinopexy performed by trainee physicians: 10 years later.","abstract":"To reassess (10 years later) outcomes after treatment of retinal tears with argon laser photocoagulation by trainee physicians as an emergency procedure.Retrospective case series analysis of 100 consecutive patients treated between September 2010 and September 2011 at a tertiary referral center, compared with the respective findings at the same institution during the period between August 2000 and December 2002.All patients underwent argon laser retinopexy in the casualty department by the on-call trainee. Forty patients (40%) needed further treatment in the form of slit lamp/indirect argon laser retinopexy or cryoretinopexy, and 58 patients (58%) received some vitreoretinal care. At final follow-up, all patients demonstrated anatomically attached retinas. The percentage needing further treatment was significantly increased compared to the relevant percentage 10 years earlier (P = .02).A significant proportion of patients required further treatment, and more than half of patients were referred to the vitreoretinal team. Over the years, trainees' indirect ophthalmoscopy and laser retinopexy skills have become progressively inadequate. Further training of junior physicians on indirect laser retinopexy may improve patient care and reduce the inconvenience of repeated visits.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702704","annotations":[{"name":"Ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.574558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Argon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Ion laser","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_laser"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States presidential election, 2000","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"}]}
