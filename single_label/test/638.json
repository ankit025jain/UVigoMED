{"id":638,"title":"Multilocus sequence typing of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from humans and chickens in North-Eastern Italy.","abstract":"This paper reports the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 57 C. jejuni and C. coli isolates from humans and chickens in Italy and the identification of 17 new sequence types (STs). A high genetic diversity was detected among C. jejuni/C. coli and human/chicken isolates, with a predominance of clonal complexes CC21 and CC828. Although human STs were not the same as those found in chickens, 3 CCs overlapped between human and chicken isolates. Genotyping of Campylobacter strains by MLST should be encouraged in order to implement surveillance and con- trol of infection in humans and in animal reservoirs in Italy.
