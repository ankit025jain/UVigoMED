{"id":86982,"title":"[Immunoprotective effect of inactivated coxsackievirus A16 vaccine in mice].","abstract":"This study aims to construct inactivated coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) vaccine and to investigate its protective effect in ICR mice. A clinical isolate of CVA16, 521-01T, was cultured in VERO cells, inactivated by formaldehyde, and purified by ultracentrifugation for vaccine preparation. Purity and other characteristics of the vaccine were determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Female ICR mice were subcutaneously inoculated with inactivated CVA16 or Al(OH)3-absorbed CVA16, followed by booster immunization at the end of 2 and 4 weeks. CVA16-specific IgG titers in serum were determined by ELISA, and titers of neutralizing antibodies were determined by viral neutralization assay. The immunity of T lymphocytes was evaluated by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay. The protective effect was evaluated by challenging the neonatal offspring (< 48 hours) of vaccinated female mice with 1 000 LD50 of CVA16 521-01T. The mortality rates of different groups were compared. The results showed that Al(OH)3 +CVA16 could induce high titers of specific IgG antibodies in ICR mice. After being boosted two times, the serum IgG antibody titer could reach up to 1 : 1 x 10(5) (P = 0.000), and neutralizing antibody titer was higher than 1 : 256. Additionally, more spot forming cells were induced in the immunized groups than in the negative controls. The maternal antibodies showed protective effect in 100% of the neonatal mice challenged with 1 000 LD50 of CVA16 521-01T. The inactivated CVA16 vaccine has ideal immunogenicity and immunoprotective effect. This research lays a foundation for the development and evaluation of CVA16 vaccines.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118375","annotations":[{"name":"Coxsackievirus","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackievirus"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"ELISPOT","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISPOT"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.843043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Passive immunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_immunity"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.655358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin domain","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.625776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.535822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.318197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Differential centrifugation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_centrifugation"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
