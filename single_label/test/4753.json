{"id":4753,"title":"[Ebola virus disease].","abstract":"The current Ebola outbreak in Western Africa differs from previous ones due to its extent. Serious shortcomings in the on-site management in Africa are obvious. In addition to the situation in the countries affected media and medical interests also focus on detection and management of imported cases in Germany. From the experience with such patients already treated in Germany the existing medical concepts have been updated and expanded.
