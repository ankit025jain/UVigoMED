{"id":78770,"title":"[Stapedoplasty in a HIV-infected patient].","abstract":"This paper reports an observation illustrating the possibility of the successful surgical treatment of otosclerosis in a HIV-infected patient presenting with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and positive response in the test for hepatitis C. The authors used the results of multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) of the temporal bones as a basis for the prediction of the outcome of the surgical intervention taking into consideration specific primary manifestations of HIV infection as well as immunological and virlogical responses to anti-retroviral therapy.
