{"id":71427,"title":"Biology of cancer and aging: a complex association with cellular senescence.","abstract":"Over the last 50 years, major improvements have been made in our understanding of the driving forces, both parallel and opposing, that lead to aging and cancer. Many theories on aging first proposed in the 1950s, including those associated with telomere biology, senescence, and adult stem-cell regulation, have since gained support from cumulative experimental evidence. These views suggest that the accumulation of mutations might be a common driver of both aging and cancer. Moreover, some tumor suppressor pathways lead to aging in line with the theory of antagonist pleiotropy. According to the evolutionary-selected disposable soma theory, aging should affect primarily somatic cells. At the cellular level, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways regulate aging and senescence. However, increasing lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these driving forces might be regulated by evolutionary-conserved pathways that modulate energy balance. According to the hyperfunction theory, aging is a quasi-program favoring both age-related diseases and cancer that could be inhibited by the regulation of longevity pathways. This review summarizes these hypotheses, as well as the experimental data that have accumulated over the last 60 years linking aging and cancer.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25071126","annotations":[{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Somatic cell","weight":0.378001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.302246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.251365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Longevity","weight":0.228415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.153647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Pleiotropy","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Perikaryon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perikaryon"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"1950s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Waste management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Parallel evolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_evolution"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Global warming","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"}]}
