{"id":76658,"title":"Exercise and weight loss: no sex differences in body weight response to exercise.","abstract":"There is a view that exercise is less effective for weight loss in women compared with men. This systematic review examines the evidence for sex-based differences in the effect of exercise on body weight. We hypothesize that, when energy expenditure is equivalent, there will be no evidence for sex differences in body weight response to exercise.
