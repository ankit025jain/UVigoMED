{"id":87338,"title":"[Experimental substantiation of the construction peculiarities of the universal apparatus, applied for transosseal osteosynthesis based on three-dimensional modelling].","abstract":"Comparative analysis of constructive peculiarities was done for Ilizarov's apparatus and elaborated universal apparatus, which is applied in transosseal ostheosynthesis in fractures of the shin bones, basing on results of the three-dimensional computeric modelling. The universal apparatus due to its unification done secures possibility to conduct the individual selection of a support, using adaptation of their form to anatomic configuration of the injured segment. This permits to lower by 19 - 49.3% the dimensions and by 15.4% a metal consumption of external construction in comparison with such of Ilizarov's apparatus and, accordingly, to rise significantly the patients treatment comfort.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252417","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.251941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.250018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.138706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"Electroweak interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Universe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe"}]}
