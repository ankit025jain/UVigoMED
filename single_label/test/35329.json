{"id":35329,"title":"4D-cine CT imaging of a bicuspid pulmonary valve.","abstract":"A 71-year-old woman underwent diagnostic workup for progressive shortness of breath. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a dilated main pulmonary artery (MPA) and an anomalous configuration of the pulmonary valve. CT revealed a bicuspid pulmonary valve (BPV) and confirmed MPA dilation. Further congenital abnormalities were excluded. An isolated finding of BPV is rather rare. To our knowledge we present the first 4-dimensional CT images of a BPV. As in this case, 4-dimensional cine cardiac CT may be helpful to reveal the underlying cause of MPA dilation.
