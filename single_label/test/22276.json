{"id":22276,"title":"The relationship between biofilm formations and capsule in Haemophilus influenzae.","abstract":"To evaluate the biofilm formation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and H. influenzae type b (Hib) clinical isolates, we conducted the following study. Serotyping and polymerase chain reaction were performed to identify ?-lactamase-negative ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible (BLNAS), ?-lactamase-negative ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), TEM-1 type ?-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR)-NTHi, and Hib. Biofilm formation was investigated by microtiter biofilm assay, as well as visually observation with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in a continuous-flow chamber. As a result, totally 99 strains were investigated, and were classified into 4 groups which were 26 gBLNAS, 22 gBLNAR, 28 gBLPAR-NTHi and 23 Hib strains. The mean OD600 in the microtiter biofilm assay of gBLNAS, gBLNAR, gBLPAR-NTHi, and Hib strains were 0.57, 0.50, 0.34, and 0.08, respectively. NTHi strains were similar in terms of biofilm formations, which were observed by SEM and CLSM. Five Hib strains with the alternated type b cap loci showed significantly increased biofilm production than the other Hib strains. In conclusion, gBLNAS, gBLNAR, and gBLPAR-NTHi strains were more capable to produce biofilms compared to Hib strains. Our data suggested that resistant status may not be a key factor but capsule seemed to play an important role in H. influenzae biofilm formation.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560562","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.815861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.805162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.437436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.396679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Confocal laser scanning microscopy","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_laser_scanning_microscopy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.359566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.331201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"CLSM","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLSM"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Laser scanning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning"},{"name":"Order of Distinction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Distinction"},{"name":"Hib vaccine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hib_vaccine"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
