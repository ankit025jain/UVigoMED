{"id":86561,"title":"Underutilization of curative treatment among patients with non small cell lung cancer: experience from a tertiary care centre in India.","abstract":"Lung cancer is one of the commonest and most lethal cancers throughout the world. The majority of the patients present at advance stage and are not suitable for curative intent treatment. Even among patients with localized disease, there has been underutilization of curative treatment modalities. The aim of this study was to analyze the radical treatment utilization rates in patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated at our centre.We analyzed case records of 104 patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC having stage 1-3B disease who were treated at our centre over last 3 years, to assess the utilization of curative treatment modalities i.e. surgery or radical radiotherapy.The median age of this cohort was 58 years. Out of 104 patients only 33 (31.7%) received curative intent treatment, 14 undergoing curative resection and 19 receiving radical doses of radiotherapy. The baseline characteristics of both the groups (with or without radical treatment) were not different. Major factors associated with underutilization with curative treatment were progressive disease or loss of follow up after chemotherapy and inappropriate use of TKI and/ or palliative radiotherapy in patients with stage 1-3B disease. Patients who did not receive radical treatment had inferior PFS and OS than those who received radical treatment.In our practice we observed gross underutilization of curative intent treatment modalities in patients with NSCLCs which is associated with inferior survival.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761917","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"India","weight":0.803857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Small-cell carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.568353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.525596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.448994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.25753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.20453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Progressivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Localized disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localized_disease"}]}
