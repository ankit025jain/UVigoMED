{"id":89783,"title":"Ecological validity of performance validity testing.","abstract":"Performance validity tests (PVTs) have been shown to relate to neuropsychological performance, but no studies have looked at the ecological validity of these measures. Data from 131 veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury from a multicenter Veterans Administration consortium were examined to determine the relation between scores on a self-report version of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory Participation Index, a measure of community participation, and the Word Memory Test, a PVT. A restricted regression model, including education, age, history of loss of consciousness, cognitive measures, and a measure of symptom validity test performance, was not significantly associated with self-reported community reintegration. Adding PVT results to the restricted model, however, did significantly improve the prediction of community reintegration as PVT failure was associated with lower self-reported community participation. The results of this study indicate that PVTs may also serve as an indicator of patients' functioning in the community.
