{"id":65051,"title":"[Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy combined with finasteride for recurrent hematospermia].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TUSV) combined with finasteride in the treatment of recurrent hemospermia.This study included 32 patients with recurrent hematospermia, with the disease course of 3 months to 4 years. After administration of finasteride at 5 mg/d for 2 weeks, the patients underwent TUSV for both exploration of the causes and treatment, followed by medication with finasteride at the same dose for another 2 weeks. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for observation of the outcomes and complications.TUSV was successfully accomplished in all the 32 cases, which revealed 16 cases of seminal vesiculitis, 10 seminal calculi, 1 seminal vesicle cyst, 2 seminal vesicle polyps, and 3 seminal vesicle abscess. The operative time was 20 to 51 (31.0 +/- 5.2) minutes. Postoperative complications included 1 case of acute epididymitis and 3 cases of breast discomfort within the first 4 weeks. No incontinence, urethral stricture, rectal injury, retrograde ejaculation, and sexual dysfunction occurred postoperatively. All the patients but 1 were followed up for 6 months to 2 years. Twenty-nine of the cases were cured, and 2 experienced recurrence.Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy combined with finasteride is safe and effective for the treatment of recurrent hemospermia.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029861","annotations":[{"name":"Seminal vesicle","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminal_vesicle"},{"name":"Epididymitis","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epididymitis"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.800688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Retrograde ejaculation","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_ejaculation"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.667191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.509903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Finasteride","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finasteride"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.324882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0834668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"}]}
