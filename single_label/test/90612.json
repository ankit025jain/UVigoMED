{"id":90612,"title":"Triceps tendon avulsion: a rare injury.","abstract":"Triceps tendon avulsion is one of the rare tendinous injuries. Such injuries can easily be missed, and should be kept as a differential diagnosis in all patients who present with pain and swelling at the back of the elbow after a traumatic event.We present a case of triceps tendon avulsion which was missed in the initial workup by a local practitioner. Careful physical examination and evaluation of the X-rays clinched the diagnosis. The patient was treated surgically by transosseous suture technique using the Krakow method. The end result was a good range of movement and a power equal to the uninjured side. A high index of suspicion, physical examination seeking a palpable gap, and search for a 'flake' fracture on lateral radiographs will help make the diagnosis of triceps avulsion. Early recognition of these injuries and prompt intervention are the cornerstones of a successful outcome. A second examination after a few days, when the swelling has reduced, should be the standard in doubtful cases or during any unclear joint injury. We recommend a primary repair through a transosseous suture technique using Krakow method for optimal results.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591806","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.755983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.689672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.543733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.470534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.292974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Avulsion fracture","weight":0.223991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_fracture"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Triceps brachii muscle","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_brachii_muscle"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Krakow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakow"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Lithic flake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithic_flake"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
