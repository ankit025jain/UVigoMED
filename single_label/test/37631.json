{"id":37631,"title":"Translation and cultural adaptation of the Hirschsprung's Disease/Anorectal Malformation Quality of life Questionnaire (HAQL) into Swedish.","abstract":"Children with anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung's Disease (HD) often have functional problems with constipation or incontinence. The Hirschsprung's Disease/Anorectal malformation Quality of life Questionnaire (HAQL) developed in the Netherlands is a disease-specific instrument measuring the quality of life (QoL) of children and adolescents with fecal incontinence. HAQL includes several domains with questions concerning diet, laxatives, constipation, diarrhea, urine and fecal incontinence, in addition to social and emotional functioning, body image, and physical symptoms. The purpose of the study was to translate and culturally adapt the HAQL questionnaire into Swedish.The translation was carried out according to accepted translation guidelines and a backward/forward translation method was used.The translation correlated well with the original. All in all the Swedish and the Dutch versions agreed well. The Swedish translators chose to use a more simplified language in the questionnaires intended for the children, but used another choice of words in the proxy version and the adolescents' version.The translation of the HAQL instrument into Swedish gives us a disease-specific QoL instrument for children and adolescents born with HD and anorectal malformations (ARM). The translated and culturally adapted HAQL instrument is included in a survey regarding children and adolescents born with ARM.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481668","annotations":[{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.733822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.636741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.590704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.548886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.504503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.482717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Laxative","weight":0.43338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.269122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.170044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"}]}
