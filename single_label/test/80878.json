{"id":80878,"title":"Durability assessment results suggest a serviceable life of two, rather than three, years for the current long-lasting insecticidal (mosquito) net (LLIN) intervention in Benin.","abstract":"LLIN distribution, every three years, is a key intervention of Benin's malaria control strategy. However, data from the field indicate that LLIN lifespan appears to vary based on both intrinsic (to the LLIN) and extrinsic factors.We monitored two indicators of LLIN durability, survivorship and integrity, to validate the three-year-serviceable-life assumption. Interviews with net owners were used to identify factors associated with loss of integrity.Observed survivorship, after 18 months, was significantly less (p<0.0001) than predicted, based on the assumption that nets last three years. Instead, it was closer to predicted survivorship based on a two-year LLIN serviceable life assumption (p=0.03). Furthermore, the integrity of nearly one third of 'surviving' nets was so degraded that they were in need of replacement. Five factors: washing frequency, proximity to water for washing, location of kitchen, type of cooking fuel, and low net maintenance were associated with loss of fabric integrity.A two-year serviceable life for the current LLIN intervention in Benin would be a more realistic program assumption.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507444","annotations":[{"name":"Textile","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Fuel","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"},{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.0628012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Cooking","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mosquito net","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net"},{"name":"Benin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin"},{"name":"Kitchen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen"},{"name":"Insecticide","weight":0.0263423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Concurrent estate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Closer (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)"},{"name":"Realism (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Durable good","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_good"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Washing","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing"}]}
