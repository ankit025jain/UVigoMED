{"id":78818,"title":"Anti-inflammatory treatment of atopic asthma guided by exhaled nitric oxide: a randomized, controlled trial.","abstract":"Atopic asthma is characterized by Th2 cytokine-driven inflammation of the airway mucosa, which is signaled by the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO).We tested whether an FENO-guided anti-inflammatory treatment algorithm could improve asthma-related quality of life and asthma symptom control, and reduce exacerbations in atopic asthmatics within primary care.Altogether, 187 patients with asthma and who were nonsmokers (age range, 18-64 years) with perennial allergy and who were on regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment were recruited at 17 primary health care centers, randomly assigned to 2 groups and followed up for 1 year. For the controls (n = 88), FENO measurement was blinded to both operator and patient, and anti-inflammatory treatment was adjusted according to usual care. In the active group (n = 93), treatment was adjusted according to FENO. Questionnaires on asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) and asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire) were completed, and asthma events were noted.The Asthma Control Questionnaire score change over 1 year improved significantly more in the FENO-guided group (-0.17 [interquartile range {IQR}, -0.67 to 0.17] vs 0 [-0.33 to 0.50]; P = .045), whereas the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score did not (0.23 [IQR, 0.07-0.73] vs 0.07 [IQR, -0.20 to 0.80]; P = .197). The change in Asthma Control Questionnaire was clinically important in subpopulations with poor control at baseline (P = .03). Furthermore, the exacerbation rate (exacerbations/patient/y) was reduced by almost 50% in the FENO-guided group (0.22 [CI, 0.14-0.34] vs 0.41 [CI, 0.29-0.58]; P = .024). Mean overall inhaled corticosteroid use was similar in both groups (P = .95).Use of FENO to guide anti-inflammatory treatment within primary care significantly reduced the exacerbation rate and improved asthma symptom control without increasing overall inhaled corticosteroid use.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565712","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.548198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.517303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.509922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.45179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.342331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Perennial plant","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Exhaled nitric oxide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaled_nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
