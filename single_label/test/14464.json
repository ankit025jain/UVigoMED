{"id":14464,"title":"[Synergic antidepressive effect of quercetin and Hypericum perforatum extract in mice].","abstract":"To explore the synergistic antidepressant effect of quercetin and hyperforin (HF, extracted from Hypericum perforatum).Male ICR mice were divided into nine groups:blank control, positive control (Paroxetine, 10 mg/kg), quercetin groups (A: 5 mg/kg, B: 10 mg/kg, C: 20 mg/kg), Hypericum perforatum extract (HF 10 mg/kg),combination groups (A: quercetin 2.5 mg/kg + HF 5 mg/kg,B:quercetin 5 mg/kg + HF 5 mg/kg,C: quercetin 10 mg/kg + HF 5 mg/kg). All drugs were administered intragastrically. Reserpine reversal tests were used to compare the reversal effects of drugs on body temperature decline, eyelid ptosis and akinesia. Tail suspension test was used to compare immobility time in each group.Combination group B showed no significant difference (P>0.05) compared with combination group C in reserpine reversal tests and tail suspension test. However, its body temperature reversal effect was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of quercetin group B, and its effect in shortening immobility time was stronger than that of HF 10 mg/kg group (P<0.05) and quercetin group B (P<0.01).The combination of quercetin and Hypericum perforatum extract in certain ratio has significant synergistic antidepressant effect in ICR mice.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24421225","annotations":[{"name":"St John's wort","weight":0.905841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort"},{"name":"Reserpine","weight":0.88562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserpine"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Paroxetine","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxetine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.352654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Ptosis (eyelid)","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(eyelid)"},{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.218691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.203362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Hyperforin","weight":0.194339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforin"},{"name":"Hypericum","weight":0.158607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypericum"},{"name":"Thermoregulation","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Hypokinesia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokinesia"},{"name":"Tail suspension test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_suspension_test"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Blank (cartridge)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_(cartridge)"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Intelligent character recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_character_recognition"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
