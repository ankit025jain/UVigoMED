{"id":92106,"title":"Time course of inflammation, myocardial injury, and prothrombotic response after radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.","abstract":"Inflammation has been linked to the genesis of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) and is implicated in early recurrent arrhythmia after AF ablation. We aimed to define the time course of inflammation, myocardial injury, and prothrombotic markers after radiofrequency ablation for AF and its relation to AF recurrence.Ninety consecutive AF patients (53% paroxysmal) undergoing radiofrequency ablation were recruited. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), Troponin-T, creatine kinase-MB, fibrinogen, and D-Dimer concentrations were measured at baseline, at 1, 2, 3, 7 days, and at 1 month after ablation. AF recurrence was documented at 3 days and at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Troponin-T and creatine kinase-MB peaked at day 1 after procedure (both P<0.05). Hs-CRP peaked at day 3 after procedure (P<0.05). Fibrinogen (P<0.05) and D-Dimer (P<0.05) concentrations were significantly elevated at 1 week after procedure. Ln hs-CRP elevation correlated with Ln Troponin-T and fibrinogen elevation. The extent of Ln hs-CRP, Ln Troponin-T, and fibrinogen elevation predicted early AF recurrence within 3 days after procedure (P<0.05, respectively), but not at 3 and 6 months.Patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for AF exhibit an inflammatory response within 3 days. The extent of inflammatory response predicts early AF recurrence but not late recurrence. Prothrombotic markers are elevated at 1 week after ablation and may contribute to increased risk of early thrombotic events after AF ablation.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446024","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.852481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.796984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.775158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.755162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Catheter ablation","weight":0.661716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter_ablation"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.342741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
