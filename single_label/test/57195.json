{"id":57195,"title":"[The analysis of maternal mortality in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya)].","abstract":"In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) a stable increase of indicator of birth rate was marked during 1990-2012. Against the background of increase of indicator of birth rate the indicator of maternal mortality has a positive tendency to decrease. During 1990-2012, indicator of maternal mortality decreased from 560.8 to 29.4 per 100 000 of born alive. In the structure of causes of maternal mortality the percentage of direct obstetric causes of death decreased i.e. toxicosis on 18%, bleeding on 82%, sepsis on 9.1%. During 2007-2012 no death case was detected. The increase of specific weight of unavoidable causes made up to 25% of obstetrical embolism, 5% in the structure of causes of maternal mortality was attached to extra-genital diseases in 2007-2012. The percentage of deceased because of complications of anesthesia increased (1.5-5%).","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219037","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.91736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.665675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Birth rate","weight":0.493791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Sakha Republic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakha_Republic"},{"name":"Specific weight","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_weight"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Republic of Ireland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/560"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Ovoviviparity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovoviviparity"}]}
