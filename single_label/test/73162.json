{"id":73162,"title":"Cell-cycle distribution and Thymidilate Synthatase (TS) expression correlate with 5-FU resistance in head and neck carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Acquired chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) remains one of the obstacles for the success of 5-FU-based cancer chemotherapy, and some molecular mechanisms of acquired 5-FU resistance are still unknown. The main action of 5-FU is the suppression of DNA replication by inhibiting Thymidylate Synthase (TS).We analyzed 5-FU resistance mechanisms using the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, UM-SCC-23, and two different resistant cell lines, UM-SCC-23/WR and UM-SCC-23/MR, which were procured from UM-SCC-23 cells. To acquire resistance, the two cells underwent repeated treatment of 5-FU with different durations and frequency. We determined differences in the cell-cycle distribution and the expression of TS proteins in the three cell lines. Moreover, cell-cycle distribution in cells which acquired resistance after 5-FU treatment, was compared to that of parental cells, using flow cytometric analysis.There was a remarkable increase in TS protein expression levels in UM-SCC-23/WR following 5-FU treatment. S-phase cells of UM-SCC-23 and UM-SCC-23/WR cells were immediately increased after treatment with 5-FU, whereas UM-SCC-23/MR were accumulated to the S-phase slightly later.The cell-cycle perturbation or elevation of TS protein expression may be involved in acquired 5-FU resistance and identifies 5-FU resistance mechanisms in the two different 5-FU treatment regimens.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922653","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.724116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.493124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.25922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.208356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0940385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0630793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
