{"id":14431,"title":"Mucosal and systemic immunity in mice after intranasal immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing ORF6 of PRRSV.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to construct mucosal vaccine of a recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing PRRSV ORF6 gene and evaluate mucosal and systemic immune response against PRRSV in mice after intranasal immunization. The result show that the vaccine can stimulate mice to produce specific IgG in serum and remarkable special s-IgA in lung lavage fluid, at the same time, the contents of cytokines IL-2 and IFN-? of the experimental group were significant higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01), however, the contents of cytokines IL-4 was not different to the all groups. In summary, the constructed mucosal vaccine can significantly induce mucosal immune, humoral immunity and cellular immunity involved Th1 type cytokines, which will lay a theoretical foundation on immune mechanism and new efficient vaccines for PRRSV.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423464","annotations":[{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.828879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cell-mediated immunity","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell-mediated_immunity"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.301952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.228977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Lactococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactococcus"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Theoretical physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
