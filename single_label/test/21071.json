{"id":21071,"title":"[Severe osteoarticular infections with Staphylococcus aureus producer of Panton-Valentine Leukocidine in children].","abstract":"Emerging strain of Stapylococcus aureus (S. aureus) producer of the Panton-Valentine Leukocidine (PVL+) are becoming a new issue in public health. Those bacteria are accountable for serious cutaneous infection with a necrotic evolution, necrotizing pneumonia and severe osteoarticular infection. These last infections can be life-threatening and are at high risk of complications. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary, in addition with an aggressive chirurgical treatment. We are here reporting 3 cases of osteoarticular infections by S. aureus PVL+ sensitive to methicilline, which illustrate the difficulties encountered in the management and treatment, as well as the potential for serious orthopedics complications.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624630","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.742918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.52429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.227058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Panton-Valentine leukocidin","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panton-Valentine_leukocidin"},{"name":"Accountability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
