{"id":40791,"title":"Minimally invasive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for fundoplication failure offers excellent gastroesophageal reflux control.","abstract":"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may represent a superior alternative to reoperative fundoplication in patients with symptomatic failure. Our goal was to assess early outcomes of patients after RYGB for failed fundoplication. Records of patients who underwent fundoplication takedown and RYGB from March 2007 to June 2013 were reviewed for demographics, comorbidities, operative findings, and perioperative outcomes. Data are reported as medians (range). Forty-five patients who had undergone 64 prior antireflux procedures (range, one to three fundoplications) were identified. Median patient age was 56 years (range, 25 to 72 years) with a body mass index of 33 kg/m(2) (range, 22 to 51 kg/m(2)). Most patients had comorbidities: hypertension (60%), anxiety/depression (44.4%), dyslipidemia (33.3%), asthma (31%), obstructive sleep apnea (26.7%), arthritis (22.2%), and diabetes (11.1%). Median symptom-free interval was 3 years (range, 0 to 25 years). All patients had an anatomic reason for failure: 83 per cent had a hiatal hernia and 35 per cent had a slipped Nissen fundoplication. The procedures were accomplished laparoscopically in 28, robotically in 13, and open in four cases. Median operative time was 367 minutes (range, 190 to 600 minutes) and estimated blood loss averaged 100 mL (range, 25 to 500 mL). Five patients (11%) required reoperation: one for an anastomotic leak, one for anastomotic obstruction, and three for early obstruction resulting from adhesions. Two patients developed respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Length of stay averaged four days (range, 1 to 33 days) with two readmissions: one for melena and one for vomiting and dehydration; neither required intervention. There was no mortality. At 11 months of follow-up (range, 2.3 to 54 months), 93.3 per cent of patients were symptom-free. When primary fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease fails, fundoplication takedown and RYGB can be accomplished safely with minimally invasive techniques. The conversion to a RYGB has an acceptable perioperative morbidity and excellent early symptom control, and, therefore, should be considered for reoperative patients gastroesophageal reflux disease.
