{"id":71346,"title":"[Barriers in health care to breast cancer: perception of women].","abstract":"Identifying the barriers in the access to health care to breast cancer perceived by women undergoing chemotherapy.An exploratory descriptive study. The sample consisted of 58 women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and registered in the public oncology ambulatory of Aracaju-Sergipe. Data collection was carried out between October 2011 and March 2012 by semistructured interviews, and data were processed using the SPSS, version 17.Among the interviewed women, 37 (63.8%) reported at least a barrier in the trajectory of care for breast cancer. The organizational and health services barriers were the most reported in the periods of investigation and treatment of breast cancer.In face of these findings, the barriers should be considered in public health policies and programs for the control of breast cancer in Sergipe.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076265","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.503001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.436087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.428679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.410842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Health policy","weight":0.261872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.103608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Sergipe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergipe"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Barriers","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers"}]}
