{"id":51638,"title":"Advanced tools for BRCA1/2 mutational screening: comparison between two methods for large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) detection.","abstract":"Currently, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is the most commonly used technique for the detection of large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) in the BRCA1/2 genes. However, a very fast assay, the BRCA1/2 multiplex amplicon quantification (MAQ), has been recently developed by Multiplicom.As no data regarding the application of MAQ method to BRCA1/2 genes are available in literature, here we compared for the first time the performance of the MAQ assay with MLPA by using several positive BRCA1/2 LGRs DNA samples (previously tested by MLPA).MAQ method was able to detect all BRCA1/2 LGRs and no false-positive or -negative results were obtained in independent repetitive experiments.We can affirm that MAQ, as well as MLPA method, results to be valid and reproducible tools for molecular diagnostics and we are confident that this assay can be used for BRCA1/2 mutational screening as a fast and safe alternative to MLPA, particularly in the first line of analysis.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670361","annotations":[{"name":"DNA","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.401991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.188519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.186157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.0505528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Amplicon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplicon"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification","weight":0.0254237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
