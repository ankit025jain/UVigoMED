{"id":68518,"title":"Capn4 mRNA level is correlated with tumour progression and clinical outcome in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"To investigate the mRNA and protein levels of calpain small subunit-1 (Capn4) in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), to analyse the relationship between Capn4 mRNA level and pathological stage of ccRCC, and to examine the potential of Capn4 as a prognostic factor in ccRCC.mRNA and protein levels of Capn4 were measured in pairs of tumour tissues and matched adjacent nontumour tissue obtained from patients with ccRCC by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Associations of the mRNA level of Capn4 with pathological tumour stage and the overall survival of ccRCC patients were also analysed.Capn4 mRNA and protein level were significantly higher in ccRCC tumour tissues compared with adjacent nontumour tissues as assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Higher Capn4 mRNA levels were observed in patients with more advanced pathological stage of ccRCC and were also associated with decreased overall survival of patients with ccRCC.The findings from this study indicate that Capn4 has the potential to be an independent prognostic indicator for ccRCC.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24514433","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.797098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.768994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.361876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.102962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Calpain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpain"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"18S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Western culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"}]}
