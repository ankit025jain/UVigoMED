{"id":38323,"title":"Tourette disorder treated with valproic acid.","abstract":"Valproic acid was successfully prescribed for a 10-year old boy suffering from Tourette's Disorder with a co-morbid bipolar diagnosis. Valproic acid has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the total number of motor tics, their frequency, intensity, complexity, and impairment in a patient who had failed to respond to numerous other medications. Valproic acid may be a useful agent to consider for children with treatment-resistant Tourette's disorder.
