{"id":62814,"title":"Detection of MYD88 L265P in peripheral blood of patients with Waldenstr√∂m's Macroglobulinemia and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.","abstract":"MYD88 L265P is highly prevalent in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). We investigated whether MYD88 L265P could be identified by peripheral blood (PB) allele-specific PCR. MYD88 L265P was detected in untreated WM (114/118; 96.6%); previously treated WM (63/102; 61.8%); and IgM MGUS (5/12; 41.7%) but in none of 3 hyper-IgM or 40 healthy individuals. Median PB MYD88 L265P ?Ct was 3.77, 7.24, 10.89, 12.33 and 14.07 for untreated WM, previously treated WM, IgM MGUS, hyper-IgM and healthy individuals, respectively (P<0.0001). For the 232 IgM MGUS and WM patients, PB MYD88 L265P ?Ct moderately correlated to bone marrow (BM) disease (r=-0.3553; P<0.0001), serum IgM (r=-0.3262; P<0.0001) and hemoglobin (r=0.3005; P<0.0001) levels. PB MYD88 L265P ?Ct and serum IgM correlated similarly with BM disease burden. For positive patients, PB MYD88 L265P ?Ct was <6.5 in 100/114 (88%) untreated WM, and >6.5 in 4/5 (80%) IgM MGUS patients (P=0.0034). Attainment of a negative PB MYD88 L265P mutation status was associated with lower BM disease (P=0.001), serum IgM (P=0.019) and higher hemoglobin (P=0.004) levels in treated patients. These studies show the feasibility for detecting MYD88 L265P by PB examination, and the potential for PB MYD88 L265P ?Ct use in the diagnosis and management of WM patients.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509637","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.794576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.772623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.742775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.694102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance","weight":0.536871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance"},{"name":"Macroglobulinemia","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroglobulinemia"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"265","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/265"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Petabyte","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte"},{"name":"Buddhahood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhahood"}]}
