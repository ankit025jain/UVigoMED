{"id":45368,"title":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients aged 80 years and older: an analysis of 111 patients.","abstract":"The incidence of cholelithiasis increases with age. More octogenarian (?80 y) patients are undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) operation throughout the world.A retrospective study was conducted on patients older than 80 years (group 1: 111 patients) and those in the 18 to 79 years age group (group 2: 185 patients), who underwent LC between July 2005 and October 2009. The variables analyzed were the presentation, demographics, comorbid illnesses, American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) scores, history of previous abdominal surgery, the operative time, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and the length of hospital stay. A comparison was made between the two groups. Data was evaluated by using the ? and the Fisher exact test. P<0.005 was considered significant.The difference in both groups in the mean age and ASA scores were significant. The indication for LC was gallstone disease in 87 (78.4%) patients, acute cholecystitis in 16 (14.4%), and gallstone pancreatitis in 8 (7.2%) of group 1 patients. The conversion rate was not statistically significant. The mean operative time was 77 minutes in group 1 patients, and this was significantly longer than that of group 2 patients. The postoperative oral intake within 24 hours of surgery was significantly earlier in group 2 patients. Other parameters were not significantly different between the 2 groups.LC in octogenarians is a relatively safe procedure that can be performed with low morbidity and mortality rates. The comorbidities and higher ASA scale are major risk factors for postoperative complications in this age group of patients.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686355","annotations":[{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.809613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.516591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.506299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.344178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.277186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"}]}
