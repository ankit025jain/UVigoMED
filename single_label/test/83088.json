{"id":83088,"title":"Use of infliximab and other biologics in Behçet disease.","abstract":"Behçet disease is a multisystem vasculitis characterised by recurrent oral ulceration in conjunction with other manifestations. Neurological involvement or neuro-Behçet disease is not common, but typically affects young men at its onset between the ages of 20 and 40 with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. There is substantial case literature to support the use of tumour necrosis factor antagonists, notably infliximab, in the treatment of neuro-Behçet disease.
