{"id":54208,"title":"ATDC/TRIM29 phosphorylation by ATM/MAPKAP kinase 2 mediates radioresistance in pancreatic cancer cells.","abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by therapeutic resistance for which the basis is poorly understood. Here, we report that the DNA and p53-binding protein ATDC/TRIM29, which is highly expressed in PDAC, plays a critical role in DNA damage signaling and radioresistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Ataxia-telangiectasia group D-associated gene (ATDC) mediated resistance to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo in mouse xenograft assays. ATDC was phosphorylated directly by MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2) at Ser550 in an ATM-dependent manner. Phosphorylation at Ser-550 by MK2 was required for the radioprotective function of ATDC. Our results identify a DNA repair pathway leading from MK2 and ATM to ATDC, suggesting its candidacy as a therapeutic target to radiosensitize PDAC and improve the efficacy of DNA-damaging treatment.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469230","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.862818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia mutated","weight":0.839894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia_mutated"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.758635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.757147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.713363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.670478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.585775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.358737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.348425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.235566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Radioresistance","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
