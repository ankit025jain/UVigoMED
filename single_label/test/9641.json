{"id":9641,"title":"Complete uterine prolapse without uterine mucosal eversion in a queen.","abstract":"A five-year-old female cat weighing 3 kg was presented by the owner after noticing a large pink, bilobed mass protruding through the vulva during labour. The cat was in good condition, with appropriate lactation, and the newborn kittens were nursing normally. The uterus was not reverted or invaginated at examination, and there was rupture of the mesovarium, mesometrium and uterine-vaginal connection around the cervix. Manual reduction of the prolapsed uterus was not possible because of torn ligaments. A coeliotomy was performed to remove the ovaries, and the apex of the uterine horns was passed by the vaginal route. The remaining part of the mesometrium was disconnected, and the prolapsed uterus was removed. The queen and kittens were discharged from the hospital on the second day after surgery. An unusual feature of this case is that the prolapse was complete, without eversion of any part of the uterus through a vaginal tear.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697408","annotations":[{"name":"Mesovarium","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesovarium"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.898823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Mesometrium","weight":0.88969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesometrium"},{"name":"Vulva","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Lactation","weight":0.831245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Uterine horns","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_horns"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.568131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.311864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Uterine prolapse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_prolapse"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Kitten","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitten"},{"name":"Pink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Queen regnant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_regnant"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"}]}
