{"id":4726,"title":"The prevalence and severity of dental caries in Chad: a pilot study.","abstract":"This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and severity of dental caries among a cross section of a sample from different locations in Chad as part of a general assessment of their oral health status.A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a nationwide sample included volunteers, 10 years or older, for a total of 1,011 participants. The survey consisted of a brief interview followed by a 1-2 minute oral examination of each subject.The mean age of the participants was 29.61 ±12.59 years and the total mean value for Decayed/Missing/Filled Teeth (DMFT)=1.96 ±1.78. Females had a higher mean DMFT (2.72 ±1.88); decayed (2.82 ±1.07); missing teeth (1.81 ±1.14) than males (1.61 ±1.60): decayed (2.11 ±1.09); missing (1.45 ±0.89, respectively; all p<0.001). The older group (>30 years) had higher DMFT (2.79 ±1.93) than the younger group (d\"30 years; p<0.001). Urban area showed lower DMFT (1.81 ±1.68) than rural areas (2.31 ±1.95).In this study, the prevalence of dental caries is very low which is similar to the most of the African Saharan and sub-Saharan countries. However, there is need to establish caries control programs to prevent tooth decay in the future and help people maintain lifelong dental health.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25331241","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.640017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.322645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.29327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.274145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.220191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Chad","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0594293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.033431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Dice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Sahara","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Cross section (geometry)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
