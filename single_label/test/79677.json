{"id":79677,"title":"[Furuncle persistent to long-term antibiotic therapy in a non-tropical region: a diagnosis that must not be overlooked: furuncular cutaneous myiasis].","abstract":"We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with furuncular myiasis living in an area with continental climate. The boy was admitted to our clinic with a wound on his nape, which started as a little acne and progressed to a large wound in which pus flowed continuously. He complained of itching and was treated with penicillin, clarithromycin, terbinafine, and ibuprofen in the last 2 months, with no big success. Otherwise, the patient was healthy, and his hygienic conditions were within normal standards. The dermatologic examination revealed an off-white ulcer measuring approximately 1x2 cm in the occipital region with regular contours, elevated borders, and purulent flow, while the skin surrounding the ulcer was normal. In the course of the examination, a living larva was removed using a forceps. The ulcer and the surroundings were washed with polyvinylprolidone iodine solution, while fusidic acid pomade was topically applied. The ulcer regressed significantly after 15 days of treatment.
