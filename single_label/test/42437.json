{"id":42437,"title":"Patients' experiences of ongoing palliative chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: a qualitative study.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in New Zealand. With new chemotherapy regimens, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are now living longer with the condition and its treatment.This study aimed to explore patients' experiences of extended palliative chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.A convenience sample of 10 outpatients who had been receiving palliative chemotherapy for more than 12 months from a teaching hospital and regional cancer centre in New Zealand participated in face-to-face semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed using a general inductive approach.Three key themes were identified: the importance of relationships, presenting a positive face, and life is for living. The importance of interpersonal relationships with health professionals and a sense of comradery with other chemotherapy patients positively affected the patients' experiences of treatment. Positivity was a key coping strategy that also has negative implications as patients may not reveal their concerns and needs.The key to improving the care of people with advanced cancer is understanding their experiences of care. Communication between the patient, family, and health-care team ensures assumptions that misinterpret attributes of positivity are not made.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852028","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.725605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.70715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.516757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.493674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.378789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.207094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.114662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Positivism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism"}]}
