{"id":50536,"title":"Contemporary review of large adrenal tumors in a tertiary referral center.","abstract":"Large adrenal tumors (LATs, ?6 cm) are uncommon and associated with malignancy in 25% of cases. Their surgical management remains debatable. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the current incidence, nature and management of LAT.We carried out a retrospective review of LATs managed in a tertiary referral center (2002-2011).Eighty-one patients were included (out of a total of 750 with adrenal tumors, 11%). Nine patients had no surgical intervention (11%). Fifty-two LATs were malignant (64%): adrenocortical carcinoma (44%), metastasis (27%) and pheochromocytoma (21%). Patients with malignant tumors exhibited a poorer 5-year overall survival than those with benign tumors (53.4% versus 96.3%, p=0.001). Disease-related mortality was approximately 60%, 29% and 0% for those with metastasis, adrenal carcinoma and malignant pheochromocytoma, respectively. The recurrence rate was the same for the three malignant sub-groups (30%).LATs are rare and more frequently malignant than previously reported. Some are benign and do not require for surgical intervention. Surgical indication and approach should be tailored for each patient.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778080","annotations":[{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.469171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.432167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Adrenocortical carcinoma","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocortical_carcinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Manager (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)"},{"name":"Center (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Local Area Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Area_Transport"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
