{"id":40184,"title":"Galectin-9-CD44 interaction enhances stability and function of adaptive regulatory T cells.","abstract":"The ?-galactoside-binding protein galectin-9 is critical in regulating the immune response, but the mechanism by which it functions remains unclear. We have demonstrated that galectin-9 is highly expressed by induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) and was crucial for the generation and function of iTreg cells, but not natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells. Galectin-9 expression within iTreg cells was driven by the transcription factor Smad3, forming a feed-forward loop, which further promoted Foxp3 expression. Galectin-9 increased iTreg cell stability and function by directly binding to its receptor CD44, which formed a complex with transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) receptor I (TGF-?RI), and activated Smad3. Galectin-9 signaling was further found to regulate iTreg cell induction by dominantly acting through the CNS1 region of the Foxp3 locus. Our data suggest that exogenous galectin-9, in addition to being an effector molecule for Treg cells, acts synergistically with TGF-? to enforce iTreg cell differentiation and maintenance.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065622","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.802668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"CD44","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD44"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3","weight":0.74051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_against_decapentaplegic_homolog_3"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.733539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.597056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.505531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.399722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"SMAD (protein)","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMAD_(protein)"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Turn (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
