{"id":10060,"title":"In vivo antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of umbelliferone isolated from Potentilla evestita.","abstract":"This study was designed to evaluate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of a compound, umbelliferone, isolated from the chloroform fraction of Potentilla evestita in animal models. When tested against acetic acid-induced noxious stimulus, it significantly prolonged pain threshold and provided 38.38% and 60.95% reduction in abdominal constriction at 5 and 10 mg/kg i.p., respectively. Post-umbelliferone injection evoked significant dose-dependent reduction in noxious stimulation with 33.65% and 58.89% pain attenuation at 5 and 10 mg/kg i.p., respectively, in the initial phase. In the late phase, it illustrated more dominant effect with 37.65% and 63.79% blockade of painful sensation. Similarly, it exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity during various assessment times (1-5 h) with 46.28% and 66.13% amelioration after 4th of administration against induced oedema. In conclusion, umbelliferone possessed strong antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting both peripheral and centrally acting pain mediators.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673335","annotations":[{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.88416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.692933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.330397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Threshold of pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain"},{"name":"Umbelliferone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbelliferone"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Potentilla","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentilla"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Acting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting"},{"name":"Demonic possession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Land improvement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_improvement"},{"name":"Noxious stimulus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noxious_stimulus"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
