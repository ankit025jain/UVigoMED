{"id":63876,"title":"Isolated bilateral uveitis in child with hypereosinophilic syndrome.","abstract":"The ocular involvement has rarely been described in hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). We report an 8-year-old girl with HES and isolated bilateral uveitis as end-organ damage. Almost 20 months after detection of persistent asymptomatic eosinophilia, she developed complete loss of vision in right eye due to retinal detachment and decreased vision in left eye. We treated this organ-threatening condition with prednisolone and imatinib mesylate, although she was negative for FIP1L1-PDGRFA fusion gene. The vision in her left eye returned to normal. At present, the child is on alternate-day low-dose prednisolone and daily imatinib. Early recognition and aggressive treatment is essential in HES with ocular involvement to save vision. Imatinib is a useful adjuvant drug even in PDGRFA/FIP1L1-negative HES.
