{"id":19340,"title":"[The many faces of neurosyphilis].","abstract":"Syphilis is an infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum. We describe two patients with chronic syphilis causing neurosyphilis. The first had had several brain infarctions due to the presence of meningovascular syphilis. Second patient suffered from motor and psychiatric symptoms caused by syphilis. The symptoms of our patients were alleviated by antibiotic therapy. Recognition of the multifaceted symptom picture of syphilis is increasingly important, because the occurrence of the disease has increased in our country over the last few decades. An early enough treatment can prevent permanent disability of the patient.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724458","annotations":[{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Neurosyphilis","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosyphilis"},{"name":"Treponema pallidum","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treponema_pallidum"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Face perception","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception"},{"name":"Globus pallidus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_pallidus"}]}
