{"id":23484,"title":"Dances with anthrax: wolves (Canis lupus) kill anthrax bacteremic plains bison (Bison bison bison) in southwestern Montana.","abstract":"Bacillus anthracis, the cause of anthrax, was recovered from two plains bison (Bison bison bison) cows killed by wolves (Canis lupus) in Montana, USA, without associated wolf mortality in July 2010. This bison herd experienced an epizootic in summer 2008, killing ? 8% of the herd, the first documented in the region in several decades. No wolf deaths were associated with the 2008 event. Surveillance has continued since 2008, with research, ranch, and wildlife personnel diligent during summer. As part of this, we tested wolf-killed bison and elk (Cervus elaphus) for anthrax during the 2010 summer using lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIA). Two bison cows were positive for protective antigen, confirming active bacteremia. The LFIA results were confirmed with traditional bacteriology recovering viable B. anthracis. No wolf fatalities were associated with the bison deaths, despite consuming the meat. Low-level anthrax occurrence in large, rough terrain landscapes remains difficult to detect, particularly if mortality in the herbivore host is not a consequence of infection. In these instances, surveillance of predators with large home ranges may provide a more sensitive indicator of anthrax emergence or reemergence in such systems. Though speculative, it is also possible that anthrax infection in the bison increased predation risk. These results also suggest B. anthracis remains a threat to wildlife and associated livestock in southwestern Montana.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484485","annotations":[{"name":"Herbivore","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore"},{"name":"Bison","weight":0.839308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison"},{"name":"Anthrax","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax"},{"name":"Elk","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Gray wolf","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf"},{"name":"American bison","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison"},{"name":"Predation","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Wildlife","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"Ranch","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch"},{"name":"Montana","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.557549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Red Deer","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Deer"},{"name":"Epizootic","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epizootic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.486326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Great Plains","weight":0.389322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.380815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Plains Bison","weight":0.211237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Bison"},{"name":"Terrain","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain"},{"name":"Cervus","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervus"},{"name":"Canis","weight":0.0665899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis"},{"name":"Dance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Landscape","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Bacillus anthracis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Southwestern United States","weight":0.0229923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Speculation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation"},{"name":"Indicator species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_species"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Home range","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_range"}]}
