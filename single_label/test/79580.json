{"id":79580,"title":"43 kDa and 66 kDa, two blood stage antigens induce immune response in Plasmodium berghei malaria.","abstract":"The hunt for an effective vaccine against malaria still continues. Several new target antigens as candidates for vaccine design are being explored and tested for their efficacy. In the present study the sera from mice immunized with 24,000 x g fraction of Plasmodium berghei has been used to identify highly immunogenic blood stage antigens. The protective antibodies present in immune sera were covalently immobilized on CNBr activated sepharose 4B and used for affinity chromatography purification of antigens present in blood stages of P. berghei. Two polypeptides of 66 and 43 kDa molecular weights proved to be highly immunogenic. They exhibited a strong humoral immune response in mice as evident by high titres in ELISA and IFA. Protective immunity by these two antigens was apparent by in vivo and in vitro studies. These two proteins could further be analysed and used as antigens in malaria vaccine design.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141540","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Antiserum","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiserum"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Affinity chromatography","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_chromatography"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Covalent bond","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.447037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Malaria vaccine","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine"},{"name":"Molecular mass","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.100692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"HPV vaccine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Sepharose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepharose"},{"name":"Hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
