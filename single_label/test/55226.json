{"id":55226,"title":"Cigarette smoking and the natural history of age-related macular degeneration: the Beaver Dam Eye Study.","abstract":"To examine the association of current cigarette smoking and pack-years smoked with the incidence and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to examine the interactions of current smoking and pack-years smoked with complement factor H (CFH, rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2, rs10490924) genotype.A longitudinal population-based study of AMD in a representative American community. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period.A total of 4439 participants in the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES).Age-related macular degeneration status was determined from grading retinal photographs. Multi-state models were used to model the relationship of current smoking and pack-years smoked and interactions with CFH and ARMS2 with the incidence and progression of AMD over the entire age range.Incidence and progression of AMD over a 20-year period and interactions between current smoking and pack-years smoked with CFH and ARMS2 genotype.The incidence of early AMD over the 20-year period was 24.4%, and the incidence of late AMD was 4.5%. Current smoking was associated with an increased risk of transitioning from minimal to moderate early AMD. A greater number of pack-years smoked was associated with an increased risk of transitioning from no AMD to minimal early AMD and from severe early AMD to late AMD. Current smoking and a greater number of pack-years smoked were associated with an increased risk of death. There were no statistically significant multiplicative interactions between current smoking or pack-years smoked and CFH or ARMS2 genotype.Current smoking and a greater number of pack-years smoked increase the risk of the progression of AMD. This has important health care implications because smoking is a modifiable behavior.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953792","annotations":[{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.686764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.308579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.286088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"History","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Beaver","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Factor H","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_H"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Multiplicative function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_function"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Dam","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Mod (video gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)"},{"name":"Transitioning (transgender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Arms Corporation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_Corporation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Beaver Dam, Wisconsin","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Dam,_Wisconsin"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Maculopathy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopathy"}]}
