{"id":17132,"title":"Review on Panton Valentine leukocidin toxin carriage among Staphylococcus aureus.","abstract":"Panton Valentine leukocidin is a toxin making pores in the polymorphonuclear cells which is a virulence factor of some strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Initially it was produced by methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus only. Later with the acquisition of mecA gene has lead it to be PVL positive methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Since MRSA are resistant to many antibiotics and further they produce a toxin the infections by PVL positive MRSA has become a challenge. PVL positive MRSA a virulent strain of drug resistant superbug MRSA that has spread around the world, has claimed many lives in UK, Europe, USA and Australia. Some strains of superbug attack the healthy young people and kill within 24 hrs. PVL positive Staphylococcus aureus has been reported to be associated with skin and soft tissue infections however they also cause invasive infections and necrotizing pneumonia. These microorganisms known to be community associated have spread to hospitals. Hospital acquired infection by such microorganisms lead to an increase in mortality hence should be controlled before they become prevalent in hospitals.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908537","annotations":[{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.716884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.70037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.542588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.449247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.440205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.398708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.224556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.211382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Sweat gland","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Panton-Valentine leukocidin","weight":0.0848469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panton-Valentine_leukocidin"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"}]}
