{"id":14849,"title":"Role of PON in anoxia-reoxygenation injury: a Drosophila melanogaster transgenic model.","abstract":"Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein found associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL), thought to prevent oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This enzyme has been implicated in lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. Anoxia-reoxygenation and oxidative stress are important elements in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. However, the role of PON1 in anoxia-reoxygenation or anoxic injury is unclear. We hypothesize that PON1 prevents anoxia-reoxygenation injury. We set out to determine whether PON1 expression in Drosophila melanogaster protects against anoxia-reoxygenation (A-R) induced injury.Wild type (WT) and transgenic PON1 flies were exposed to anoxia (100% Nitrogen) for different time intervals (from 1 to 24 hours). After the anoxic period, flies were placed in room air for reoxygenation. Activity and survival of flies was then recorded.Within 5 minutes of anoxia, all flies fell into a stupor state. After reoxygenation, survivor flies resumed activity with some delay. Interestingly, transgenic flies recovered from stupor later than WT. PON1 transgenic flies had a significant survival advantage after A-R stress compared with WT. The protection conferred by PON1 expression was present regardless of the age or dietary restriction. Furthermore, PON1 expression exclusively in CNS conferred protection.Our results support the hypothesis that PON1 has a protective role in anoxia-reoxygenation injury, and its expression in the CNS is sufficient and necessary to provide a 100% survival protection.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400090","annotations":[{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.898993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Drosophila melanogaster","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.868479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.86061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Calorie restriction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.587251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.582994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.276029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Hypoxia (environmental)","weight":0.230041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Paraoxonase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraoxonase"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Survival of the fittest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
