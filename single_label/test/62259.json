{"id":62259,"title":"Skin necrosis: a rare complication of protein S deficiency.","abstract":"Hereditary protein S deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder leading to recurrent venous thrombosis and, less commonly, to arterial thrombosis. Cases of skin necrosis have been documented in patients with protein C or S deficiency while being treated with warfarin. We describe herein a patient with protein S deficiency who developed significant skin necrosis without being exposed to warfarin. She had a protracted clinical course resulting in gangrene and transmetatarsal amputation. Recognition of this rare complication and an earlyhematology referral may prevent dismal outcomes in patients with protein S deficiency.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600778","annotations":[{"name":"Warfarin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin"},{"name":"Gangrene","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangrene"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Protein C","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_C"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.801792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.701041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.645535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.600373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.596761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Protein S deficiency","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_S_deficiency"},{"name":"Protein S","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_S"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
