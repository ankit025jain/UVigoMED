{"id":23939,"title":"Colonization of an acid resistant Kingella denitrificans in the stomach may contribute to gastric dysbiosis by Helicobacter pylori.","abstract":"In the stomach of a gastric ulcer patient who had been administered an anti-acid, a gram-negative and urease-negative bacillus similar in size to Helicobacter pylori was infected together with H. pylori. According to biochemical test and 16S rRNA gene analysis, the urease-negative bacterium was identified as Kingella denitrificans, a human nasopharyngeal commensal. In contrast to the standard strain of K. denitrificans, the isolate showed catalase activity, did not produce acid from glucose, and exhibited acid tolerance. Acid tolerance of H. pylori was increased by cocultivation with the K. denitrificans isolate, but not with other isolates of K. denitrificans. Disruption of physiological and immunological niche by dysbiotic colonization of bacterium may provide pathological attributes to human stomach. Collectively, a careful administration of anti-acids to the elderly, especially those with atrophic gastritis, is necessary to avoid repression of the gastric barrier to bacteria.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462438","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.85672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.807902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.78525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.491951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Atrophic gastritis","weight":0.355372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophic_gastritis"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.258481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dysbiosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"}]}
