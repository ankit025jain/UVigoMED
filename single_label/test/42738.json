{"id":42738,"title":"Combined assessment of epidermal [corrected] growth factor receptor dual color in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with downstream gene mutations in prediction of response to the anti-EGFR therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Biomarkers associated with anti-EGFR antibodies therapy have been investigated in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted this study to evaluate the clinical utility of a combined assessment of EGFR status and genomic mutations of the EGFR downstream signal pathway in predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody treatment.We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues and evaluated the EGFR status by immunohistochemistry (IHC), dual color in situ hybridization (DISH) and genomic analyses of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and NRAS by direct sequencing.A total of 129 patients were evaluated in our study. Among KRAS wild-type patients, EGFR DISH positivity was associated with a higher response rate than DISH negativity (56.3 vs. 21.1%, p = 0.011). A subgroup with EGFR DISH positivity plus IHC3+ and wild-type of EGFR downstream gene mutations achieved higher response rate and disease control rate. EGFR DISH positivity, KRAS codon 146 mutation and NRAS codon 61 mutation were prognostic factors in both progression-free survival and overall survival by multivariate analyses.Combined assessment of DISH plus IHC and EGFR downstream gene mutations was useful to predict the response to anti-EGFR antibodies treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer patients in our study.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830936","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.759379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.717586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.689819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.685154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.675808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.622519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.423912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.261516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma_RAS_viral_oncogene_homolog"},{"name":"PIK3CA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIK3CA"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
