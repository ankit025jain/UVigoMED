{"id":80796,"title":"Neuroimmunopathology of Trypanosoma cruzi-induced megaoesophagus: Is there a role for mast cell proteases?","abstract":"Tryptase and chymase are mast cell (MC)-specific proteases, which influence in the activation of inflammatory cells. In this study, we quantified tryptase- or chymase-expressing MCs in the oesophaguses of Chagas patients, and searched for a correlation between those data with area of nerve fibres that expressed either PGP9.5 (pan-marker) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which is a neuromediator that has anti-inflammatory activity. Samples from the oesophaguses of 14 individuals Trypanosoma cruzi-infected and from six uninfected individuals were analysed by immunohistochemistry. It was demonstrated that the number of tryptase-IR MCs in infected individuals increased when compared with controls, regardless of whether the individuals had megaoesophagus, whereas the number of chymase-IR MCs increased only in infected individuals without megaoesophagus. Negative correlations were observed between tryptase-IR MCs and the density of nerve fibres that expressed VIP or PGP 9.5-IR. The participation of chymase and tryptase in this type of immunopathology is discussed.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530752","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.928136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.891569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.777963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.401326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Vasoactive intestinal peptide","weight":0.200945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide"},{"name":"Trypanosoma brucei","weight":0.0988413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_brucei"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pretty Good Privacy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"},{"name":"Tryptase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptase"},{"name":"Immunopathology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunopathology"},{"name":"Chymase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chymase"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_carboxy-terminal_hydrolase_L1"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Mast (sailing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_(sailing)"},{"name":"Vasoactive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
