{"id":11904,"title":"Effect of vitamin D on postoperative adhesion formation in a rat uterine horn adhesion model.","abstract":"To determine the role of vitamin D for preventing or reducing postoperative adhesions.The uterine horn adhesion model was carried out in 24 female Wistar rats. The animals were randomized into 4 groups: (1) control, (2) Ringer's lactate, (3) olive oil, and (4) vitamin D. Adhesion grade and histologic findings of adhesion-carrying tissues were evaluated, and groups were compared according to these parameters.Rats treated with vitamin D had less adhesion and lower inflammation grade when compared to the control and Ringer's lactate groups, and the results were statistically significant (p < 0.05). On the other hand, no difference was detected between the groups according to the fibrosis score.Vitamin D decreased postsurgical adhesion scores by both visual scores and histologic analyses in a rat model. Further experimental and clinical trials are required to confirm these results.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568046","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Olive oil","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.491949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Olive","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive"},{"name":"Uterine horns","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_horns"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Ringer","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringer"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Horn (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)"}]}
