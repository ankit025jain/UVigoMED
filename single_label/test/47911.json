{"id":47911,"title":"p53 codon 72 polymorphism interactions with dietary and tobacco related habits and risk of stomach cancer in Mizoram, India.","abstract":"This study was carried out to investigate the interaction of p53 codon 72 polymorphism, dietary and tobacco habits with reference to risk of stomach cancer in Mizoram, India. A total of 105 histologically confirmed stomach cancer cases and 210 age, sex and ethnicity matched healthy population controls were included in this study.The p53 codon 72 polymorphism was detected by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. H. pylori infection status was determined by ELISA. Information on various dietary and tobacco related habits was recorded with a standard questionnaire.This study revealed that overall, the Pro/ Pro genotype was significantly associated with a higher risk of stomach cancer (OR, 2.54; 95%CI, 1.01-6.40) as compared to the Arg/Arg genotype. In gender stratified analysis, the Pro/Pro genotype showed higher risk (OR, 7.50; 95%CI, 1.20-47.0) than the Arg/Arg genotype among females. Similarly, the Pro/Pro genotype demonstrated higher risk of stomach cancer (OR, 6.30; 95%CI, 1.41-28.2) among older people (>60 years). However, no such associations were observed in males and in individuals <60 years of age. Smoke dried fish and preserved meat (smoke dried/sun dried) consumers were at increased risk of stomach cancer (OR, 4.85; 95%CI, 1.91-12.3 and OR, 4.22; 95%CI, 1.46-12.2 respectively) as compared to non-consumers. Significant gene-environment interactions exist in terms of p53 codon 72 polymorphism and stomach cancer in Mizoram. Tobacco smokers with Pro/Pro and Arg/Pro genotypes were at higher risk of stomach cancer (OR, 16.2; 95%CI, 1.72-153.4 and OR, 9.45; 95%CI, 1.09-81.7 respectively) than the non-smokers Arg/Arg genotype carriers. The combination of tuibur user and Arg/Pro genotype also demonstrated an elevated risk association (OR, 4.76; 95%CI, 1.40-16.21).In conclusion, this study revealed that p53 codon 72 polymorphism and dietary and tobacco habit interactions influence stomach cancer development in Mizoram, India.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568485","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.663569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.623912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.593362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.571231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"India","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.551675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.28755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Drying (food)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying_(food)"},{"name":"Stockfish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Ethology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"}]}
