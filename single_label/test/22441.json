{"id":22441,"title":"Treatment of postoperative infection after posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation in a patient with neuromuscular scoliosis.","abstract":"According to the literature, patients with neuromuscular scoliosis have a higher rate of infection after spinal fusion. No randomized controlled trials have been completed to assess the optimal treatment and related outcomes for patients with infections after posterior spinal fusion. In this article, we examine the data and report a case in which a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device was used as definitive treatment for a deep wound infection after posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation in a patient with neuromuscular scoliosis. Our patient, a 17-year-old adolescent girl with progressive neuromuscular scoliosis, underwent posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation and bone graft from T2 to sacrum without complication. One month after surgery, she presented with a draining wound. She underwent repeat surgical irrigation and debridement with subsequent use of a wound VAC. The wound VAC was used for more than 2 months, until skin closure was complete. The deep polymicrobial wound infection was treated successfully and definitively with a wound VAC. This case report suggests that good long-term outcomes can be achieved with use of a wound VAC for definitive closure, with possible avoidance of other secondary surgeries requiring skin grafts or flaps for wound closure.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551867","annotations":[{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.815278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.702805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.675664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.588317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.527552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.509082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.472164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Spinal fusion","weight":0.429635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.385974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.327476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.311276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.265802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0720117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Alternating current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"}]}
