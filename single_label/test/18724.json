{"id":18724,"title":"[Patient compliance as one of the factors determining the efficiency of eradication therapy].","abstract":"To improve the quality of eradication therapy (ET), by increasing patient compliance.An open-label cohort multicenter randomized study was conducted. A total of 350 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection-associated diseases and indications for ET were examined. Work was done to improve compliance in a study patient group before treatment.In the study group of patients motivated for treatment, the efficiency of ET was significantly higher than in the control group. The factors influencing treatment adherence were identified and methods to optimize compliance during H. pylori eradication were developed.Awareness of the essence of the disease in a patient and his higher motivation for compliance are one of the components of successful H. pylori eradication.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772504","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.347041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.313715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.268037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Essence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Efficiency (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
