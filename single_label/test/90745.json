{"id":90745,"title":"Morel-Lavallée lesion of the lumbar region.","abstract":"The patient was a 21-year-old male cadet at a military academy who was evaluated by a physical therapist in a direct-access capacity for a chief complaint of low back pain that began the previous day after falling directly onto his back while snowboarding. Given the patient's history of trauma, worsening low back pain, and enlarged soft tissue mass in the lumbar region, the physical therapist ordered magnetic resonance imaging. The findings were consistent with a Morel-Lavallée lesion of the lumbar region.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579797","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.201725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.157157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.133022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Snowboarding","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding"},{"name":"Chief complaint","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_complaint"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Cadet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadet"},{"name":"Military academy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_academy"},{"name":"Complaint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Academy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy"}]}
