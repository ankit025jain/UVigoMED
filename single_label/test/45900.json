{"id":45900,"title":"Gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI for differentiation of FNH  and HCA: a single centre experience.","abstract":"Evaluation of enhancement characteristics of histopathologically confirmed focal nodular hyperplasias (FNHs) and hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.Sixty-eight patients with 115 histopathologically proven lesions (FNHs, n=44; HCAs, n=71) examined with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were retrospectively enrolled (standard of reference: surgical resection, n=53 patients (lesions: FNHs, n=37; HCAs, n=53); biopsy, n=15 (lesions: FNHs, n=7; HCAs, n=18)). Two radiologists evaluated all MR images regarding morphological features as well as the vascular and hepatocyte-specific enhancement in consensus.For the hepatobiliary phase, relative enhancement of the lesions and lesion to liver enhancement were significantly lower for HCAs (mean, 48.7 (±48.4)%and 49.4 (±33.9) %) compared to FNHs (159.3 (±92.5) %; and 151.7 (±79) %; accuracy of 89%and 90 %, respectively; P<0.001). Visual strong uptake of FNHs vs. hypointensity of HCAs in the hepatobiliary phase resulted in an accuracy of 92 %. This parameter was superior to all other morphological and dynamic vascular criteria alone and in combination (accuracy, 54–85 %).For differentiation of FNHs and HCAs by means of MRI, gadoxetic acid uptake in the hepatobiliary phase was found to be superior to all other criteria alone and in combination.EOB-MRI is well suited to differentiate FNHs and hepatocellular adenomas. For this purpose hepatobiliary phase is superior to unenhanced and dynamic imaging. Hepatobiliary phase (peripheral) hyper- or isointensity is typical for FNH. Hepatobiliary phase hypointensity is typical for hepatocellular adenomas. EOB-MRI helps to avoid misinterpretations of benign hepatocellular lesions.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658870","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.844756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.821942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.725075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.387038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.333892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Gadoxetic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadoxetic_acid"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"FN Herstal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_Herstal"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hospital Corporation of America","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Corporation_of_America"},{"name":"Hepatobiliary system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatobiliary_system"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Host adapter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_adapter"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"}]}
