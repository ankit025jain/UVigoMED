{"id":54431,"title":"[Management of ovarian endometriomas: intraperitoneal cystectomy versus fenestration and coagulation].","abstract":"ovarian endometriomas is a common condition among women of reproductive age and represents a major cost in terms of public health. Despite these implications for public health, it remains difficult to arrive at a consensus on the optimal surgical treatment.To study the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of this pathology and to compare two major surgical techniques: the intraperitoneal cystectomy and fenestration -coagulation in terms of recurrence and prognosis for future fertility.A retrospective study of 31 patients who underwent surgical treatment for ovarian endometrioma histologically proved. The study period covers 10 years from January 2000 to December 2009.Laparoscopy was performed in 27 patients. The endometrioma was located to the left side in 64% of cases. The main strategy performed is intraperitoneal cystectomy in 18 patients (58.8%). In second place we find the fenestration-coagulation. The mean duration of postoperative follow-up is 10.3 months. The recurrence of the cyst and the persistence of pain symptoms were significantly less frequent in the group of patients who underwent intraperitoneal cystectomy.The laparoscopic surgery remains the first line approach in terms of ovarian endometrioma.Cystectomy offers performance equal or superior to the fenestration-coagulation technique, and exposes to fewer recurrences. For these reasons, it should be recommended. The fenestration-coagulation is possible in case the cystectomy is difficult or incomplete.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458674","annotations":[{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.772907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ovarian cyst","weight":0.729219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cyst"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
