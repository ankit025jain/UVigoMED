{"id":88268,"title":"Two cases of proximal pole scaphoid fracture accompanied by lunate fracture.","abstract":"We experienced two cases of simultaneous fracture of the scaphoid and the lunate. In two cases, both scaphoid and lunate fractures existed on the same plane, which may help us to understand the mechanism of proximal fracture of the scaphoid.
