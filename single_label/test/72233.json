{"id":72233,"title":"A prospective pilot study of psychosocial functioning in head and neck cancer patient-caregiver dyads.","abstract":"This study explored the psychosocial functioning of 10 head and neck cancer patient-caregiver dyads over the radiation/chemoradiation (radiation or combined chemoradiation) treatment period, including the interdependence in patient-caregiver quality of life (QOL). Dyads were recruited prior to or at the initiation of radiation/chemoradiation treatment. Patient QOL decreased across the treatment trajectory, and many caregiver QOL subscales decreased during the middle of treatment. Caregiver burden increased over the treatment trajectory with levels remaining relatively low. Patients and caregivers demonstrated interdependence in QOL toward the middle and conclusion of treatment. Patients demonstrated more depression than caregivers at all time points. Results suggest that both members of the dyad should be targeted for psychosocial interventions during radiation/chemoradiation treatment period.
