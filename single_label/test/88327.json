{"id":88327,"title":"Optimizing the passenger air bag of an adaptive restraint system for multiple size occupants.","abstract":"The development of the adaptive occupant restraint system (AORS) has led to an innovative way to optimize such systems for multiple size occupants. An AORS consists of multiple units such as adaptive air bags, seat belts, etc. During a collision, as a supplemental protective device, air bags can provide constraint force and play a role in dissipating the crash energy of the occupants' head and thorax. This article presents an investigation into an adaptive passenger air bag (PAB).The purpose of this study is to develop a base shape of a PAB for different size occupants using an optimization method. Four typical base shapes of a PAB were designed based on geometric data on the passenger side. Then 4 PAB finite element (FE) models and a validated sled with different size dummy models were developed in MADYMO (TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands) to conduct the optimization to obtain the best baseline PAB that would be used in the AORS. The objective functions-that is, the minimum total probability of injuries (?Pcomb) of the 5th percentile female and 50th and 95th percentile male dummies-were adopted to evaluate the optimal configurations. The injury probability (Pcomb) for each dummy was adopted from the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (US-NCAP).The parameters of the AORS were first optimized for different types of PAB base shapes in a frontal impact. Then, contact time duration and force between the PAB and dummy head/chest were optimized by adjusting the parameters of the PAB, such as the number and position of tethers, lower the Pcomb of the 95th percentile male dummy.According to the optimization results, 4 typical PABs could provide effective protection to 5th and 50th percentile dummies. However, due to the heavy and large torsos of the 95th percentile occupants, the current occupant restraint system does not demonstrate satisfactory protective function, particularly for the thorax.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867567","annotations":[{"name":"Seat belt","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Airbag","weight":0.556152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Collision","weight":0.475778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision"},{"name":"Finite element method","weight":0.425681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.304822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.0568868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Rijswijk","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijswijk"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_Organisation_for_Applied_Scientific_Research"},{"name":"Passenger","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Legislature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature"},{"name":"Multiple unit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_unit"},{"name":"Sled","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sled"},{"name":"Crash test dummy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_test_dummy"},{"name":"Law of total probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Belt (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Power system protection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_system_protection"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Burstable billing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstable_billing"},{"name":"Space tether","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tether"},{"name":"Finite set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"}]}
