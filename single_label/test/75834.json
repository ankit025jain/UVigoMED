{"id":75834,"title":"Lacosamide-induced rash.","abstract":"Cutaneous eruptions and hypersensitivity represent frequently reported side effects of anti-seizure medications. However, these side-effects have rarely been previously reported for lacosamide, a newer-generation anti-seizure medication with a novel mechanism of action. Here, we report a case of diffuse skin eruption in a patient with history of epilepsy soon after initiation of lacosamide. The rash resolved after discontinuation of lacosamide and use of antihistamines and steroids. We also review the information on drug hypersensitivity syndrome.
