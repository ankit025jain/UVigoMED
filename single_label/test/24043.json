{"id":24043,"title":"State of the art in the clinical treatment of endotoxic shock.","abstract":"Sepsis is a major health problem and remains an important cause of death worldwide. The failure to convert advances in our understanding of the biologic features of sepsis into effective new therapies questions the current approach to the development of sepsis drugs, and suggests a need for newer and better clinical trial design. Blood purification for sepsis is a promising therapeutic strategy to improve survival and reduce organ failure in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457487","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.701447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.289263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Organ failure","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_failure"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Water purification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
