{"id":24082,"title":"Short communication: subtyping of Mycobacterium kansasii by PCR-restriction enzyme analysis of the hsp65 gene.","abstract":"Mycobacterium kansasii is one of the most common causes of pulmonary disease resulting from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). It is also the most frequently isolated NTM species from clinical specimens in Poland. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of M. kansasii subtypes among patients suspected of having pulmonary NTM disease. Fifty clinical isolates of M. kansasii recovered from as many patients with suspected mycobacterial lung disease between 2000 and 2010 in Poland were genotyped by PCR-restriction enzyme analysis (PCR-REA) of partial hsp65 gene. Mycobacterium kansasii subtype I was the only genotype to be identified among the isolates, both disease-associated and non-disease-associated. Isolation of M. kansasii subtype I from clinical specimens may be indicative of infection but may also merely represent colonization.
