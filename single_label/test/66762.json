{"id":66762,"title":"Assessing the burden of complications after surgery for clinically localized kidney cancer by age and comorbidity status.","abstract":"To examine the association between high-risk patient status (age >75 years or Charlson comorbidity index count >2) and postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgical management for clinically localized renal tumors.Patients undergoing radical nephrectomy (RN) or partial nephrectomy (PN) (2005-2012) for localized renal cell carcinoma were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to test the association between high-risk status and postoperative complications adjusting for patient, tumor, and operative characteristics.Of 1092 patients undergoing PN (71.9%) or RN (28.1%) for clinically localized renal tumors, 255 (23.4%) were classified as high risk, and 175 patients (16%) developed at least 1 complication (mean 1.6 Â± 1.0). Of note, 22.4% and 14.1% of high- and low-risk patients developed a complication, respectively (P = .002). Comparing high- and low-risk patients, significant differences in Clavien I-II (20.4% vs 11.1%; P <.001) and medical (16.1% vs 8.1%, P <.001) complications were observed, whereas no differences were seen in Clavien III-V or surgical complications. No differences in complications were observed comparing patients treated with RN and PN, albeit high-risk patients were more likely to undergo RN (35.3% vs 25.9%, P = .04). After adjustment, the odds of incurring any complication were 1.9 times higher in high- compared with low-risk patients (odds ratio 1.9 [confidence interval 1.3-2.8]).Regardless of surgical type, patients deemed high risk by age and comorbidity criteria were more likely to incur a postoperative complication after renal mass resection. Improved understanding of surgical risks in the elderly and infirmed will help better inform patients deciding between active surveillance and resection of renal tumors.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680455","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.843988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.683731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.590493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.515083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0930287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"1092","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1092"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Royal Navy","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
