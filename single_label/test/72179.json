{"id":72179,"title":"Breast cancer survivors' perspectives on whether clinical staff should ask breast cancer patients about childhood abuse.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that women who recall childhood abuse are at increased risk of emotional problems following a breast cancer diagnosis. How services should respond is unclear given the risk of compounding the emotional trauma of cancer with questioning about abuse. Our aim was to present the research findings to women with experience of breast cancer so as to obtain their perspective on how this evidence should influence clinical practice.Participants were women who had been treated for breast cancer at one of the study units and women with a history of breast cancer who were members of a local patient support group. Three focus groups were conducted (with six, five and three participants respectively). The interview transcripts were analysed qualitatively.Participants emphasised the importance of the research findings for cancer care. The consensus was that abuse and its consequences for patients being treated for cancer should not be a 'taboo' area, and that patients should be given the opportunity and choice to disclose abuse as part of a holistic programme of care.Services should examine how to include prompts about abuse as part of routine holistic assessment by clinical staff, who will need to be trained in eliciting and managing disclosures of abuse.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992420","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.709541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.668899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Taboo","weight":0.549271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.388867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.359921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.25322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Support group","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Recall election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Interrogation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogation"}]}
