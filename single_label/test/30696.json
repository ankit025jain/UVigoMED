{"id":30696,"title":"Fatal suicidal poisoning with antituberculosis agents with ST elevation and acute coronary syndrome symptoms--a case report.","abstract":"A 19-years old, previously healthy male, ingested the higher amount of rifampicin, isoniazyd, pyrazinamide, ketoprofene and alcohol. Within less than 20 hours he developed dyspnoe, pruritus, red man syndrome, and ECG changes suggesting acute coronary syndrome appeared - ST interval elevation. In the next few hours chest pain appeared and troponin I concentration was elevated (13.54 ng/ml). The performed echocardiography revealed global hypokinesis with the decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (approx. 30%). There was no significant pathological changes in coronarography, except for slowed blood flow. Further patient developed cardiogenic shock, pulmonary oedema and died within 32 hours from medication overdose.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466713","annotations":[{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Acute coronary syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_coronary_syndrome"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.78298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Cardiogenic shock","weight":0.781175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiogenic_shock"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.700456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.621393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.593264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"ST elevation","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST_elevation"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.276462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pyrazinamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrazinamide"},{"name":"Troponin I","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin_I"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
