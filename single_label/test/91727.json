{"id":91727,"title":"Simultaneous arthrodiastasis and deformity correction for a patient with ankle osteoarthritis and lower limb deformity: a case report.","abstract":"We here report a case of a 50-year-old male with ankle osteoarthritis and lower limb deformity, for which simultaneous deformity correction and arthrodiastasis were performed. The patient initially experienced an open fracture on the left tibia at 19 years, but it was malunited. The Japanese Society for Surgery score of the foot for the left ankle was 53 points. X-ray and CT imaging showed rotational and angular tibial deformities with shortening by 1.6cm and end-stage osteoarthritis of the left ankle. An external fixator was applied to correct the lower limb deformity, and ankle arthrodiastasis was performed. A good result was achieved in alignment correction and joint function. The patient had an improved clinical score of 98 points at a 2-year followup. We found that external fixation was useful because external fixator is the only appropriate instrument by which arthrodiastasis and deformity correction for ankle osteoarthritis can be simultaneously performed.
