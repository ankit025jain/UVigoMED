{"id":61554,"title":"Lymphtaping for lymphoedema: an overview of the treatment and its uses.","abstract":"Lymphtaping is recognised to be a promising method for use in the management of lymphoedema. This article gives an overview of the concept of lymphtaping and the relevant literature. Several methods of action are described about lymphtaping: increasing pressure differences within lymph vessels; lifting the skin (inducing opening of initial lymph vessels); connective tissue becoming more flexible; and the micromassage effect. Medical taping concepts have only become the subject of scientific research in the last decade as the technique is still relatively new. Several misunderstandings around lymphtaping therefore still exist. These are discussed, supported by the available evidence. The article demonstrates that lymphtaping is a promising technique in the treatment of lymphoedema, and should be another choice for contraindicating pressure therapy patients and in areas where compression is difficult or impossible to use. However, each patient should be assessed and evaluated thoroughly and individually so that the appropriate treatment and properties can be determined.
