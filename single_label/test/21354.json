{"id":21354,"title":"Accuracy of prospective space-time surveillance in detecting tuberculosis transmission.","abstract":"To improve detection of tuberculosis transmission, public health can supplement contact tracing with space-time surveillance. However, investigation of space-time clusters not due to transmission (false alarms), may lead to costly, unnecessary interventions. We measured the accuracy of prospective space-time surveillance in detecting tuberculosis transmission, assessing the number of clusters containing transmission and the false alarm rate. We simulated monthly prospective applications of a scan statistic using the home addresses and diagnosis dates of all 1566 culture-positive TB cases reported in Montreal during 1996-2007. We verified transmission within the space-time clusters by analyzing the TB genotype. Over 11.5 years, at 1.3 false alarms per month, we detected 89 transmission chains; at 0.05 false alarms per month we detected 5 transmission chains. We found evidence that prospective space-time surveillance for TB leads to a high false alarm rate, limiting its practical utility in settings with TB epidemiology similar to Montreal.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606994","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.758549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.624073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.552802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.374684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.23094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.147671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"False alarm","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_alarm"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Contact tracing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing"},{"name":"Statistic","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1566","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1566"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Alarm devices","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_devices"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Chain (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Address (geography)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_(geography)"},{"name":"Tracing (software)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)"}]}
