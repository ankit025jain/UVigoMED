{"id":61376,"title":"[Immunodeficiency related malignant lymphoma: diagnosis and therapy of AIDS-related lymphoma].","abstract":"AIDS-related lymphoma (ARL) remains a significant burden for specialists in HIV/AIDS medicine. Pathological findings of ARL are often non-typical in various histological types. Diagnosis of correct histological type of ARL by the skilled pathologist is essential. Therapy of patients with ARL is the challenge of integrating treatment appropriate for the stage and histological subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition to chemotherapy, essential components of an optimal ARL treatment strategy include antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724417","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.837669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.7295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.295642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Australian Rugby League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
