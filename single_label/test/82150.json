{"id":82150,"title":"Orthodontic retraction of autotransplanted premolar to replace ankylosed maxillary incisor with replacement resorption.","abstract":"This case report describes the successful treatment of an adult with lip protrusion and a previously traumatized maxillary central incisor that had experienced replacement root resorption. An extracted premolar was transplanted into the incisor space and retracted orthodontically. Autotransplantation was successful with complete root formation and, combined with orthodontic treatment, provided a satisfying esthetic outcome.
