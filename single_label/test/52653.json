{"id":52653,"title":"The ideal blood pressure target to prevent cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: a neutral viewpoint.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and essential hypertension are often associated, and retrospective data analyses suggest an association between lower blood pressure (BP) values and lower cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients with T2DM. However, the most recent intervention trials fail to demonstrate a further CV risk reduction, for BP levels <130/80 mm Hg, when compared to levels <140/90 mm Hg. Moreover, a J-shaped, rather than a linear, relationship of BP reduction with incident CV events has been strongly suggested. We here debate the main available evidences for and against the concept of 'the lower the better', in the light of the main intervention trials and meta-analyses, with a particular emphasis on the targets to be pursued in elderly patients. Finally, the most recent guidelines of the scientific societies are critically discussed.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582686","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.592019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.590478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.557171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.523851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.188079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.185579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
