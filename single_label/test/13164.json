{"id":13164,"title":"The effects of Ph?1?, a spider toxin, calcium channel blocker, in a mouse fibromyalgia model.","abstract":"This study investigated the effects of Ph?1?, pregabalin and diclofenac using an animal model of fibromyalgia (FM). Repeated administration of reserpine (0.25 mg/kg sc) once daily for three consecutive days significantly decreased thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, and dopamine and serotonin content in the brain on the 4th day. Ph?1? and pregabalin treatment completely reverted the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by reserpine treatment on the 4th day, but diclofenac was ineffective. Reserpine treatment significantly increased the immobility time in the forced swim test, which is indicative of depression in the animals. Ph?1?, but not pregabalin, reduced the immobility time (56%), suggesting that Ph?1? may control persistent pathological pain in FM.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491352","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.844176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","weight":0.820698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Pregabalin","weight":0.813295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin"},{"name":"Allodynia","weight":0.810842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allodynia"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Reserpine","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserpine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.669734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Diclofenac","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac"},{"name":"Spider","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.329941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Human swimming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming"},{"name":"Channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_blocker"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"}]}
