{"id":73830,"title":"Changes in vitamin and mineral supplement use after breast cancer diagnosis in the Pathways Study: a prospective cohort study.","abstract":"Vitamin and mineral supplement use after a breast cancer diagnosis is common and controversial. Dosages used and the timing of initiation and/or discontinuation of supplements have not been clearly described.We prospectively examined changes in use of 17 vitamin/mineral supplements in the first six months following breast cancer diagnosis among 2,596 members (28% non-white) of Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of initiation and discontinuation.Most women used vitamin/mineral supplements before (84%) and after (82%) diagnosis, with average doses far in excess of Institute of Medicine reference intakes. Over half (60.2%) reported initiating a vitamin/mineral following diagnosis, 46.3% discontinuing a vitamin/mineral, 65.6% using a vitamin/mineral continuously, and only 7.2% not using any vitamin/mineral supplement before or after diagnosis. The most commonly initiated supplements were calcium (38.2%), vitamin D (32.01%), vitamin B6 (12.3%) and magnesium (11.31%); the most commonly discontinued supplements were multivitamins (17.14%), vitamin C (15.97%) and vitamin E (45.62%). Higher education, higher intake of fruits/vegetables, and receipt of chemotherapy were associated with initiation (p-values <0.05). Younger age and breast-conserving surgery were associated with discontinuation (p-values <0.05).In this large cohort of ethnically diverse breast cancer patients, high numbers of women used vitamin/mineral supplements in the 6 months following breast cancer diagnosis, often at high doses and in combination with other supplements. The immediate period after diagnosis is a critical time for clinicians to counsel women on supplement use.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884705","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Dietary mineral","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Institute of Medicine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Multivitamin","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.756014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.645084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.48297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"California","weight":0.479203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.301155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Northern California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California"},{"name":"Kaiser Permanente","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Permanente"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
