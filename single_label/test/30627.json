{"id":30627,"title":"The relationship of self-rated health with functional status, toxicity and mortality: results of a prospective pilot study of older patients with newly-diagnosed cancer.","abstract":"To determine the association between self-rated health (SRH) and functional status, comorbidity, toxicity of treatment and mortality in older patients with newly-diagnosed cancer.Patients aged 65 and over, newly diagnosed were recruited at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada. SRH and functional status [instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), basic activities of daily living (ADL), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), frailty markers and number of comorbid conditions] were evaluated prior to the start of treatment, and at 3, 6 and 12 months (SRH only). Treatment toxicity and mortality data were abstracted from the chart. Logistic regression was also used to examine the relationship between functional status, comorbidity and SRH at baseline. Logistic and Cox regression were used to examine the association between baseline SRH and treatment toxicity/time to death.There were 112 participants enrolled on this study (median age 74.1). At baseline, 74 patients (66.1%) had a good SRH and 38 patients (33.9%) had poor SRH. Only an increasing number of comorbid conditions was associated with poor SRH at baseline in both univariate and multivariable analysis. We found no association between SRH and toxicity or mortality.A substantial proportion had poor SRH prior to and during cancer treatment. An increasing number of comorbidities was associated with poor SRH at baseline. SRH did not predict toxicity or mortality. Attention to comorbid conditions in older patients with cancer is warranted considering their impact on SRH in this population.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472474","annotations":[{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.734476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.672841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.607424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.521577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.407887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.293724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.279776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.176375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Judaism","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Sir Mortimer B.
