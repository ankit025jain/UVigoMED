{"id":39146,"title":"[Laparoscopic and NOTES endovideosurgical interventions for colonic diseases].","abstract":"Peculiarities of learning period and results of endovideosurgical interventions in colonic diseases were analyzed. In 72 patients laparoscopic technology was applied, in 5-transanal endomicrosurgical (TEM) rectal resection for various colonic diseases, including 67 (87%)--for colorectal cancer. Complications have had occur in 9 (11.7%) patients. All the patients are alive. There was no need for formation of unloading or protective stoma. Performance of endovideosurgical operations in colon diseases is expedient because of their lesser traumaticity, reduction of a stationary treatment period and the need for diagnostic and treatment measures postoperatively.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252546","annotations":[{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.710553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.643049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.599309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0390912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_orifice_translumenal_endoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"}]}
