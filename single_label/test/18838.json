{"id":18838,"title":"Is minocycline a solution for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii?","abstract":"Minocycline is an old, safe, second-line antimicrobial agent that has drawn attention over the last few years as a possible therapeutic option against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) clinical isolates. Recent in vitro and in vivo results indicate that minocycline is a valid, alternative treatment option for minocycline-susceptible MDR-AB. Although effective alone, its administration as monotherapy should be avoided. Combinations with other antimicrobials can reduce the MIC of each component, present synergism and minimize the risk for drug resistance. Owing to its limited solubility in urine, it should be avoided for urinary pathogens. The present article reports all available information regarding its use as a therapeutic option against MDR-AB.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762305","annotations":[{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.614354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.500236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.441745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Minocycline","weight":0.268056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minocycline"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"}]}
