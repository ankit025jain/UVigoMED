{"id":69684,"title":"Radioimmunoconjugates for the treatment of cancer.","abstract":"Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been developed for more than 30 years. Two products targeting the CD20 antigen are approved in the treatment of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBL): iodine 131-tositumomab and yttrium 90-ibritumomab tiuxetan. RIT can be integrated in clinical practice for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) or as consolidation after induction chemotherapy. High-dose treatment, RIT in first-line treatment, fractionated RIT, and use of new humanized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), in particular targeting CD22, showed promising results in NHBL. In other hemopathies, such as multiple myeloma, efficacy has been demonstrated in preclinical studies. In solid tumors, more resistant to radiation and less accessible to large molecules such as MAbs, clinical efficacy remains limited. However, pretargeting methods have shown clinical efficacy. Finally, new beta emitters such as lutetium 177, with better physical properties will further improve the safety of RIT and alpha emitters, such as bismuth 213 or astatine 211, offer the theoretical possibility to eradicate the last microscopic clusters of tumor cells, in the consolidation setting. Personalized treatments, based on quantitative positron emission tomography (PET), pre-therapeutic imaging, and dosimetry procedures, also could be applied to adapt injected activity to each patient.
