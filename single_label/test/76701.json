{"id":76701,"title":"School nurse facilitated programs for families living fit.","abstract":"School nurses are in a unique position to facilitate provision of knowledge to children and their parents regarding balanced, healthy lifestyles. Nurses can become empowered with the knowledge gained from reviewing obesity programs with demonstrated improvements in obesity-related outcomes such as Kids Living Fit (KLF) and Nurses Living Fit (NLF). Garnering resources from your school and community, school nurses can create programs using methods from KLF and NLF to facilitate Families Living Fit (FLF). With the provision of programs, ideally children and parents will also feel empowered through knowledge gained as a result of their participation in FLF programs focusing on healthy lifestyles, incorporating the balance between activities chosen/exercise and foods consumed/nutrition.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937902","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.641196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"School","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.194999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Honda Fit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Fit"},{"name":"School nursing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nursing"},{"name":"School nurse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nurse"},{"name":"The KLF","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_KLF"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0158863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Self care","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_care"},{"name":"Viet Cong","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Separation of powers","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"}]}
