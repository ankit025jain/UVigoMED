{"id":62529,"title":"Recurrent secondary postpartum hemorrhages due to placental site vessel subinvolution and local uterine tissue coagulopathy.","abstract":"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) represents a serious problem for women and obstetricians. Because of its association with hemorrhagic shock and predisposition to disseminated coagulopathy, it is a leading cause of maternal deaths worldwide. Furthermore, the jeopardy of PPH is rising with the secondary form of PPH occurring between 24 hours and 6 weeks postpartum, when women are already discharged home. The causes of this pathology are severe inflammation (endometritis), inherited coagulation disorders, consumptive coagulopathy, and retained products of conceptions. Others are of rare occurrence, such as vessel subinvolution (VSI) of the placental implantation site, uterine artery pseudoaneurysm, or trauma.We present a rare form of recurrent secondary postpartum hemorrhage in a woman after uncomplicated cesarean delivery, with review of the literature linked to the management of this situation originating in the rare local VSI in the placental implantation site, defective decidual homeostasis, and coagulopathy confined to the uterus.The placental site VSI is one of the rare causes of secondary PPH, and this situation is frequently underdiagnosed by clinicians. The histological confirmation of dilated \"clustered\"-shaped myometrial arteries partially occluded by thrombi of variable \"age\" together with the presence of endovascular extravillous trophoblasts confirms the diagnosis.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558972","annotations":[{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Postpartum hemorrhage","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.742257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation"},{"name":"Trophoblast","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophoblast"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.651102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.506431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.399747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.323873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Myometrium","weight":0.200993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myometrium"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.13054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Endometritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometritis"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"}]}
