{"id":45764,"title":"Ligaments of the rectum: anatomical and surgical considerations.","abstract":"The ligaments of the rectum have been the subject of controversy for decades. Not only have their contents and components been a source of contention, but also the very existence of these ligaments has been called into question. This article explores the anatomical features of these ligaments with implications for surgical treatment of rectal prolapse, rectal cancer, and resection of the rectum and mesorectum. A theory about the evolution of the lateral rectal ligaments and the mesorectum in humans and higher mammals is also presented.
