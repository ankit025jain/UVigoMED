{"id":56330,"title":"Anti-MOG antibodies in adult patients with demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system.","abstract":"The myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is considered as a candidate marker of demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system. Here, sera samples from 48 consecutive Japanese patients with myelitis or optic neuritis (ON), but negative for anti-aquaporin (AQP) 4 antibodies (Abs), and 14 anti-AQP4 Ab-positive patients were tested for anti-MOG Abs using a cell-based immunofluorescence assay with full-length human MOG cDNA. Anti-MOG Abs were detected in four male patients with myelitis or ON. Oveall, 13 neuromyelitis optica-seronegative and all anti-AQP4 Ab-positive patients were negative for anti-MOG Abs. Hence, these findings warrant further examinations in large cohort series.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703097","annotations":[{"name":"Oligodendrocyte","weight":0.942736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodendrocyte"},{"name":"Optic neuritis","weight":0.866178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuritis"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Demyelinating disease","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demyelinating_disease"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.775441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.518614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein","weight":0.463159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_oligodendrocyte_glycoprotein"},{"name":"Myelitis","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelitis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.267374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Warrant (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Abz Love","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abz_Love"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
