{"id":87487,"title":"[MR manifestations and clinical significance of iliotibial band friction syndrome].","abstract":"To describe the MRI features of Iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS), in order to improve the understanding and diagnosis of ITBFS.The MR findings of 16 patients (18 knees )of clinically diagnosis ITBFS were reviewed retrospectively.The MRI features of ITBFS:(1)Ill- defined abnormal signal intensity extended to the lateral femoral epicondyle.(2) Poorly defined abnormal signal intensity presented deep to the ITB adjacent to the lateral femoral epicondyle. (3) Fluid collections medial to the ITB adjacent to the lateral femoral epicondyle. (4) The part of ITB over the lateral femoral epicondyle was thicker. (5) Joint effusion. (6)Other abnormal signs.MRI is a relatively good method for detection of ITBFS.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25143167","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.775073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.52381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Iliotibial tract","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_tract"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Lateral epicondyle of the femur","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_epicondyle_of_the_femur"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Epicondyle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicondyle"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Ill (France)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ill_(France)"}]}
