{"id":3965,"title":"Knowledge of uterine fibroid symptoms and presentation among African-American women: a pilot study.","abstract":"To assess awareness and knowledge of fibroid symptoms and presentation among African-American women.This was a cross-sectional survey study completed by a convenience sample of African-American women attending a community fair. Questions covered demographics, medical history, technology use, and fibroid knowledge. A total of437 surveys were distributed, 320 were returned, and 199 met eligibility criteria.Participants' mean age was 48.8 +/- 12.9 years. Of them, 65.8% lacked college degrees and 43.2% had annual household incomes of < $25,000. The prevalence of inadequate health literacy was 14.1%. Most knew that fibroids are more common in African-American women (74.9%), can cause menorrhagia (80.9%), and can increase odds of miscarriage (74.4%). Many thought that fibroids are cancerous (47.2%), increase the risk of heart disease (32.7%), or are diagnosable via blood test (46.2%). Internet usage and education had highest correlations with fibroid awareness. Health literacy status showed no significant correlation with cumulative fibroid knowledge.African-American women's knowledge of the symptoms of fibroids is intact; however, they are less familiar with the systemic impact of the tumors. Additional research is needed to further assess women's knowledge offibroids and to develop interventions for patient education.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330686","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Heart
