{"id":90805,"title":"Use of flexible esophagoscopy by otolaryngologists.","abstract":"We used questionnaires to determine current practice patterns for esophagoscopy by otolaryngologists in the United States, with attention to foreign body management.A 10-item questionnaire designed to determine the prevalence of flexible esophagoscopy use among otolaryngologists, with a particular focus on foreign body removal, was created and sent via e-mail to all members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. A second, 6-question survey to assess the level of resident training in flexible esophagoscopy was similarly created and sent to all directors of US otolaryngology residency programs.There were a total of 160 respondents to the first survey from all geographic regions, most of whom were in group private practice. Overall, only 21.3% of the respondents were trained to perform flexible esophagoscopy during residency, whereas 43% of those who graduated after 1990 received this training. Most respondents performed flexible esophagoscopy without sedation in the office setting. The most common indications were evaluation of dysphagia, screening for complications of laryngopharyngeal reflux, and panendoscopy for head and neck cancer. Nearly 70% of the respondents were either primarily responsible for foreign body management at their institution or shared this responsibility with a gastroenterology department. Eighty-four percent used the rigid esophagoscope alone for this purpose. More than three quarters of otolaryngology residency programs currently include flexible esophagoscopy in their training, which is performed equally in the operating room and in the office; most favor rigid esophagoscopy for foreign body retrieval but use both techniques.There has been a rapid increase in the use of flexible esophagoscopy by otolaryngologists. The majority of residency programs currently include flexible esophagoscopy in their training. Otolaryngologists play a major role in esophageal foreign body management and primarily use the rigid esophagoscope for this purpose.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574417","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.80712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.727332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.632976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.517819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.323107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.3215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.168416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Residency (medicine)","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Laryngopharyngeal reflux","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngopharyngeal_reflux"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Email","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
