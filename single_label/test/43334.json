{"id":43334,"title":"Performance of rapid hepatitis C virus antibody assays among high- and low-risk populations.","abstract":"Rapid tests for the detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) can facilitate access to diagnosis.This study aimed to evaluate the performance of rapid tests for anti-HCV detection in the sera, whole blood, and oral fluid samples from individuals with different endemicity profiles and risk behaviors.Three groups donated biological samples that were tested using three anti-HCV rapid tests (WAMA, Bioeasy and OraSure): (I) suspected cases of hepatitis C, (II) individuals who were living in remote areas in Brazil and (III) crack users and beauty professionals. Reproducibility, repeatability and cross-reactivity to other infectious agents (dengue, HIV, malaria, and syphilis) were also evaluated.In group I, specificities varied from 93.75% to 100% and sensitivities varied from 76.03% to 93.84% according to the EIA results. When anti-HCV/HCV RNA-reactive sera samples were considered true-positive HCV cases, the sensitivities and specificities varied from 86.3% to 99.09% and 93.75% to 100%, respectively. In group II, the OraSure rapid test presented the best performance. In group III, the Bioeasy assay performed best using saliva and whole blood and the OraSure assay performed best using oral fluid samples. The reproducibility and repeatability of the WAMA and Bioeasy tests were excellent. The level of concordance between the HCV EIAs and the rapid tests using samples that were reactive for other infectious agents varied from 82.35% to 100% for the WAMA assay and 94.11% to 100% for the Bioeasy assay.All of the rapid tests could be used to identify active HCV infection among individuals with different endemicity profiles and risk behaviors.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794796","annotations":[{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.735959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.731065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.514458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.441775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.291093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.273383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.242722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.208726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Point-of-care testing","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-care_testing"},{"name":"Beauty","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty"},{"name":"Crack cocaine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
