{"id":67936,"title":"[Prostate cancer].","abstract":"For many clinical issues regarding prostate cancer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining increasing importance for prostate diagnostics. The high morphological resolution of T2-weighted sequences is unsurpassed compared to other imaging modalities. It enables not only the detection and localization of prostate cancer but also allows the evaluation of extracapsular extensions. Functional MRI methods, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) increase the specificity and to a lesser extent, the sensitivity of diagnostics. In accordance with the interdisciplinary S3 guidelines, prostate MRI is recommended for patients with at least one negative biopsy for cancer detection. According to the guidelines areas suspected of being cancerous should be selectively biopsied in addition to the systematic biopsy. The transmission of findings about the suspected tumor areas according to the structured PI-RADS classification system has proven its worth. The localization and staging of prostate carcinoma is best achieved with the help of MRI and is recommended in the S3 guidelines especially for tumors with a clinical stage cT3/4 or with a Gleason grading system score ?8. In addition to these applications MRI is mainly used under study conditions for local recurrence or active surveillance.
