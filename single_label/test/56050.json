{"id":56050,"title":"Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation with multiple iris cysts.","abstract":"Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome with characteristic findings, including exudative retinal detachment, rapid cataract formation, and uveal melanocytic tumors. We report a case notable for bilateral iris and ciliary body cysts--a rare presentation of the disease.A woman in her 50s presented with bilateral decreased vision. Her medical history was significant for clear cell adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Slitlamp examination revealed a contiguous ring of pigmented translucent iris cysts at the pupillary margin of each eye, confirmed with ultrasound biomicroscopy. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the left eye showed a geographic patch of subretinal fluid temporal to the macula that was associated with orange polygonal pigment. The patient underwent periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide, with resolution of the subretinal fluid. Recurrent fluid was treated successfully with a second injection of triamcinolone.Our case of BDUMP appears to be the first to demonstrate multiple iris and ciliary body cysts with high-quality color photography and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Involvement of the anterior uveal tract may be more common than reported in the literature because of its occult nature. Ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography may be useful in patients with suspected BDUMP to identify anterior uveal tract involvement.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763691","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal
