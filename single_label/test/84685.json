{"id":84685,"title":"Experience of low volume split-dose bowel preparation for computed tomography colonography.","abstract":"We propose a new preparation method for the computed tomography colonography (CTC). This method consists of giving a small volume (400 ml) of cleansing solution on the day before the examination and the same volume of solution on the day of the examination [low volume split-dose (LVSD) method]. Using this method, we compared the volume of residual fluid in the colon, the CT value of the residual fluid, and the quality of stool tagging with those for patients undergoing the conventional bowel preparation method. Polyp detectability of the CTC using this method and the acceptability of the preparation were also investigated. The volume of residual fluid in the colon with this method was smaller than that with the conventional method. The CT value of the residual fluid with this method was higher than that with the conventional method. Visual assessment of the quality of stool tagging with this method gave similar results to those obtained using the conventional method. The sensitivities were 95% for 5-10 mm polyps and 100% for polyps larger than 10 mm. The PPVs were 91% for 5-10 mm polyps and 100% for polyps larger than 10 mm. These results appear to be as good as in previous reports. In the questionnaires, about 80% of the answers were favorable regarding the volume and the taste of laxative. We conclude that LVSD bowel preparation method for CTC maintains polyp detectability and is better tolerated.
