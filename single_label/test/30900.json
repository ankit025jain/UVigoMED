{"id":30900,"title":"Alcohol use potentiates marijuana problem severity in young adult women.","abstract":"Most young adult women who smoke marijuana also drink alcohol. Marijuana-related problems are associated with marijuana use frequency. We hypothesized that increased alcohol use frequency potentiates the association between frequency of marijuana use and marijuana-related problem severity.We recruited women aged 18 to 24 who smoked marijuana at least monthly and were not treatment seeking. Marijuana and alcohol use were measured using the timeline follow-back method. Problems associated with marijuana use were assessed using the Marijuana Problems Scale.Participants (n = 332) averaged 20.5 ± 1.8 years of age, were 66.7% non-Hispanic White, and reported using marijuana on 51.5 ± 30.6 and alcohol on 18.9 ± 16.8 of the 90 previous days. Controlling for education, ethnicity, years of marijuana use, and other drug use, frequency of marijuana use (b = .22; p < .01) and frequency of alcohol use (b = 0.13; p < .05) had significant, positive effects on marijuana problem severity. In a separate multivariate model, the linear by linear interaction of marijuana by alcohol use frequency was significant (b = 0.18; p < .01), consistent with the hypothesis.Concurrent alcohol use impacts the experience of negative consequences from marijuana use in a community sample of young women. Discussions of marijuana use in young adults should consider the possible potentiating effects of alcohol use.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439950","annotations":[{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.804468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.628201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.590836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.58647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.567958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Young-adult fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young-adult_fiction"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Chronology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
