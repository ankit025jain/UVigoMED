{"id":23977,"title":"Alternaria keratitis and hypopyon after clear-cornea phacoemulsification.","abstract":"We report a case of Alternaria keratitis and hypopyon following clear-corneal cataract surgery. A 66-year-old woman presented with a painful red left eye several months after uneventful self-sealing clear-corneal phacoemulsification that was unresponsive to prolonged treatment with topical/oral quinolones and topical corticosteroids. A full-thickness stromal white dense infiltrate in the area of the intrastromal tunnel incision and a 2.0 mm hypopyon were observed. Culture from corneal scrapings revealed Alternaria species. Treatment included topical and subconjunctival injections of amphotericin-B (5 mg/mL) and 200 mg of oral ketoconazole. Complete resolution of the corneal infiltration and hypopyon was observed after 30 days of treatment, with no recurrence during 6 years of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Alternaria species keratitis complicating self-sealing clear-corneal cataract surgery. Topical and subconjunctival injections of amphotericin-B and oral ketoconazole were effective in resolving the corneal abscess and anterior chamber inflammatory reaction.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461506","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.777624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Ketoconazole","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.690932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.643122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.615849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.494372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.291683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.193744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Hypopyon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopyon"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Proprietary software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software"},{"name":"Alternaria","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternaria"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 66","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_66"}]}
