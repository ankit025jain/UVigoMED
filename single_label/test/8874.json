{"id":8874,"title":"Induction of neutralizing antibodies to influenza A virus H7N9 by inactivated whole virus in mice and nonhuman primates.","abstract":"We evaluated the immunogenicity of hemagglutinin (HA) in the context of inactivated H7N9/AH/1/13-PR8 whole-virion. At 4weeks after immunization with 15?g HA, mice produced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers of 1:192 and neutralizing antibodies of 1:317. Aluminum hydroxide (alum), or a booster immunization, or both increased HI to 1:768, 1:384, 1:896 and neutralizing antibodies to 1:1868, 1:2302, 1:10,000, respectively. Macaques generated HI of 1:190 or 1:360 and virus neutralizing titers of 1:280 or 1:658 at 3weeks after immunization with HA alone or with alum. Sera from immunized mice and macaques protected mice from infection of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), suggesting an H7N9 vaccine is immunologically feasible.
