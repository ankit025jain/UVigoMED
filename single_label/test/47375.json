{"id":47375,"title":"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 silencing promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell invasion in vitro.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the world and metastasis is an essential aspect of HCC progression. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) has been implicated as a potential suppressor gene to regulate tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, we silenced TFPI-2 in the HCC cell line MHCC97-L and evaluated the role of TFPI-2 in cell invasion and its impact on gene expression. We showed in this study that stable TFPI-2 downregulation in MHCC97-L cells resulted in increased cell adhesion and invasion. We also showed that mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-1/3, CD44, and ICAM-1 were increased, while those of MMP-2/9 were not changed by TFPI-2 silencing. Furthermore, silencing of TFPI-2 caused increased Akt phosphorylation level and NF-?B transcription in MHCC97-L cells. In conclusion, this study confirms that TFPI-2 downregulation can contribute to tumor invasion of HCC cells through alteration in the expression of metastasis-related genes.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591127","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"CD44","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD44"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.845535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.706266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.659502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.441745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.3325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.261574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Tissue factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_factor"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"}]}
