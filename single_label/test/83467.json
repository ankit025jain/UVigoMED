{"id":83467,"title":"Disruption of glucose tolerance caused by glucocorticoid excess in rats is partially prevented, but not attenuated, by arjunolic acid.","abstract":"Arjunolic acid (AA) obtained from plants of the Combretaceae family has shown anti-diabetic effects. Here, we analyzed whether the diabetogenic effects of dexamethasone (DEX) treatment on glucose homeostasis may be prevented or attenuated by the concomitant administration of AA. Adult Wistar rats were assigned to the following groups: vehicle-treated (Ctl), DEX-treated (1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally for 5 days) (Dex), AA-treated (30 mg/kg body weight by oral gavage twice per day) (Aa), AA treatment previous to and concomitant to DEX treatment (AaDex), and AA treatment after initiation of DEX treatment (DexAa). AA administration significantly ameliorated (AaDex) (P > 0.05), but did not attenuate (DexAa), the glucose intolerance induced by DEX treatment. AA did not prevent or attenuate the elevation in hepatic glycogen and triacylglycerol content caused by DEX treatment. All DEX-treated rats exhibited hepatic steatosis that seemed to be more pronounced when associated with AA treatment given for a prolonged period (AaDex). Markers of liver function and oxidative stress were not significantly altered among the groups. Therefore, AA administered for a prolonged period partially prevents the glucose intolerance induced by DEX treatment, but it fails to produce this beneficial effect when given after initiation of GC treatment. Since AA may promote further hepatic steatosis when co-administered with GCs, care is required when considering this phytochemical as a hypoglycemiant and/or insulin-sensitizing agent.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345246","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.874674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.842163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Phytochemical","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochemical"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.812786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.801413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.613752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.587928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.516493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.515504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.374684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.141167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
