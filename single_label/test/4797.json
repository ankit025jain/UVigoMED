{"id":4797,"title":"Transmission dynamics and control of Ebola virus disease outbreak in Nigeria, July to September 2014.","abstract":"We analyse up-to-date epidemiological data of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Nigeria as of 1 October 2014 in order to estimate the case fatality rate, the proportion of healthcare workers infected and the transmission tree. We also model the impact of control interventions on the size of the epidemic. Results indicate that Nigeriaâ€™s quick and forceful implementation of control interventions was determinant in controlling the outbreak rapidly and avoiding a far worse scenario in this country.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323076","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ebola","weight":0.729575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.630569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.573422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.464644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"}]}
