{"id":67557,"title":"[The role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of hypertension].","abstract":"Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Innate and adaptive immune response may contribute to this process. The mechanisms implicating immune response in hypertension are still elusive. To date, the evidence originates in three major areas of data: cytokine production, central nervous system (CNS) stimulation and kidney damage. The cytokine microenvironment can become proinflammatory and propagate low-grade inflammation, which may contribute to vascular injury and end-organ damage in hypertension. In addition, stimulation of the CNS by some stimuli (e.g. angiotensin II) causes mild hypertension that may modulate peripheral immune responses leading to aggravation of blood pressure elevation. The immune response can induce kidney injury and also interfere with sodium excretion, further contributing to elevation of blood pressure.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605401","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.826664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.758635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.724967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.719996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.585087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.55166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.314275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.163159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0204923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Frustration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration"}]}
