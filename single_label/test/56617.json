{"id":56617,"title":"Stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis.","abstract":"To describe a new classification of stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis (SNIFR).Retrospective case series and literature review.A total of 17 patients from 5 institutions.Detailed case history, multimodal imaging, and genetic testing were reviewed for patients with macular schisis without a known predisposing condition. Patients with a stellate appearance centered on the fovea with correlating confirmed expansion of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were included. Exclusion criteria included a family history of macular retinoschisis, a known genetic abnormality associated with retinoschisis, myopic traction maculopathy, epiretinal membrane, vitreoretinal traction, optic or scleral pit, or advanced glaucomatous optic nerve changes.Clinical features, anatomic characteristics, and visual acuity.A total of 22 eyes from 16 female patients and 1 male patient with foveomacular schisis were reviewed from 5 institutions. Initial visual acuity was ? 20/50 in all eyes (mean, 20/27), but visual acuity in a single eye decreased from 20/20 to 20/200 after the development of subfoveal fluid. The refractive status was myopic in 16 eyes, plano in 3 eyes, and hyperopic in 2 eyes. Three eyes had a preexisting vitreous separation, and 19 eyes had an attached posterior hyaloid. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to >5 years.In this largest known series of patients with SNIFR, all patients demonstrated splitting of the OPL in the macula with relatively preserved visual acuity (? 20/40) except in a single patient in whom subretinal fluid developed under the fovea.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Eye
