{"id":52095,"title":"Hemoglobin A1c predicts heart failure hospitalization independent of baseline cardiac function or B-type natriuretic peptide level.","abstract":"Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart failure (HF). We examined whether baseline HbA1c level predicts HF incidence independent of other HF risk factors, including baseline cardiac structural and functional abnormalities.In patients with type 2 diabetes, multivariable Cox regression models were constructed to examine the independent association between baseline HbA1c and future HF hospitalization.In 608 subjects (mean age, 66.5 years; men, 68%; mean HbA1c, 9.1% (76 mmol/mol)), 92 were hospitalized for HF during a median follow-up of 6 years. For a 1% (11 mmol/mol) increase in baseline HbA1c, the hazard ratio for HF was 1.23 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.7, p<0.001) with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. The effect of HbA1c on HF was independent of baseline left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, the ratio of peak early to late diastolic filling velocity, and prevalent/incident coronary heart disease (CHD), and was more evident in patients with enlarged LV, decreased systolic function, prevalent CHD, or prevalent HF.In patients with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c significantly predicts future HF hospitalization independent of baseline BNP level or echocardiographic parameters.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System
