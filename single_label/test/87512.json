{"id":87512,"title":"Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance--Veterans' Group Life Insurance regulation update--ABO, VGLI application, SGLI 2-year disability extension. Final rule.","abstract":"This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insurance regulations concerning Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) to reflect the statutory provisions of the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010, which became law on October 13, 2010, and resulted in the need for amendments to change the SGLI Disability Extension period from 1 year to 2 years in duration; provide SGLI Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI) retroactive coverage effective from October 7, 2001, for all qualifying injuries regardless of the geographic location and military operation in which the injuries were incurred; and remove the SGLI and Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) Accelerated Benefits Option (ABO) discount rate. This rule also clarifies that ``initial premium'' refers to ``initial Veterans' Group Life Insurance premium,'' updates the current address of the Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (OSGLI), managed by Prudential Insurance Company of America, to reflect where the ABO application is mailed for processing, and corrects the OSGLI phone number. Finally, this rule removes the ABO application form from the regulation, and it corrects and clarifies language concerning the VGLI application period that was inadvertently incorrectly modified in a prior amendment of the regulations.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122940","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.838373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.837401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Statute","weight":0.707899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Life insurance","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.546382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.499217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.143995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Ex post facto law","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Discount rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_rate"},{"name":"Prudential Financial","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudential_Financial"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Constitutional amendment","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment"},{"name":"October 7","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7"},{"name":"October 13","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_13"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Redlining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining"},{"name":"Veterans' benefits","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans'_benefits"},{"name":"ABO blood group system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tournament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament"},{"name":"Discounts and allowances","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounts_and_allowances"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Continuing education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education"},{"name":"Telephone number","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number"},{"name":"Military operation","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation"}]}
