{"id":30962,"title":"High-resolution computed tomographic findings of cocaine-induced pulmonary disease: a state of the art review.","abstract":"Cocaine is the most commonly used illicit drug among patients presenting at hospital emergency departments and the most frequent cause of drug-related deaths reported by medical examiners. Various respiratory problems temporally associated with cocaine use have been reported. Acute and chronic uses also are responsible for lung complications, such as pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension, organizing pneumonia, emphysema, barotrauma, infection, cancer, eosinophilic disease, and aspiration pneumonia. Although most imaging findings are nonspecific, they may raise suspicion of a cocaine-related etiology when considered together with patients' profiles and medical histories. This literature review describes cocaine-induced diseases with pulmonary involvement, with an emphasis on high-resolution chest computed tomographic findings and patterns.
