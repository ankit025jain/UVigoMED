{"id":51941,"title":"Association between ghrelin gene variations, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"To investigate the association between 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP501A/C and 604 G/A) in the promoter of the ghrelin gene and the hormonal and metabolic phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a Chinese population.285 patients with PCOS and 260 healthy controls were selected for a prospective, case-control study at Shandong Provincial Hospital, Jinan, China. All subjects underwent genotype analysis of the 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ghrelin gene. Measurements were also taken of blood lipids, glucose, and hormone levels, and calculations of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were performed to detect hormonal and metabolic phenotypes.No significant diff erences in polymorphism genotypes were found between PCOS patients and healthy controls. However, the frequency of the -501 A/C A allele was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group. PCOS -501 A/C A carriers had significantly higher BMI and WHR than PCOS women with the CC genotype. -604 G/A polymorphisms were not associated with clinical or biochemical characteristics of PCOS.The -501 A/C polymorphism of the ghrelin gene is associated with metabolic features of PCOS in a Chinese population.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643690","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.846453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"China","weight":0.586431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.477417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ghrelin","weight":0.121367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"}]}
