{"id":88158,"title":"Effect of microseparation and third-body particles on dual-mobility crosslinked hip liner wear.","abstract":"Large heads have been recommended to reduce the risk of dislocation after total hip arthroplasty. One of the issues with larger heads is the risk of increased wear and damage in thin polyethylene liners. Dual-mobility liners have been proposed as an alternative to large heads. We tested the wear performance of highly crosslinked dual-mobility liners under adverse conditions simulating microseparation and third-body wear. No measurable increase in polyethylene wear rate was found in the presence of third-body particles. Microseparation induced a small increase in wear rate (2.9mm(3)/million cycles). A finite element model simulating microseparation in dual-mobility liners was validated using these experimental results. The results of our study indicate that highly crosslinked dual-mobility liners have high tolerance for third-body particles and microseparation.
