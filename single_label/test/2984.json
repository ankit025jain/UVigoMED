Diagnosis of placenta accreta before delivery allows multidisciplinary planning in an attempt to minimize potential maternal or neonatal morbidity and mortality The diagnosis is usually established by 2D, 3D Ultrasonography and Color Doppler ultrasonography and occasionally supplemented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510048","annotations":[{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.758686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.415944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.209583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.101224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Placenta accreta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta_accreta"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Maternal health","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health"}]}
