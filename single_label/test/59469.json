{"id":59469,"title":"The role of inflammation in cervical cancer.","abstract":"Knowledge regarding cervical cancer and human papillomavirus is expanding rapidly. Inflammation subsequent to viral infection is a driving force that accelerates cancer development. The infiltrated immune cells and their secretory cytokines along with chemokines and growth factors greatly contribute the malignant traits of cervical cancer. A better understanding of the mechanisms related to inflammation and cancer progression in terms of pathogen survival, cancer development, progression, and metastasis will lead to innovative approach for treating cancer.
