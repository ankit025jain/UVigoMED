{"id":61637,"title":"A novel tetramethylnaphthalene derivative selectively inhibits adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells in vitro.","abstract":"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1). The tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene derivative TMNAA has recently been identified as a selective inhibitor of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells but not of uninfected T-cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In the present study, more than 100 derivatives of TMNAA were synthesized and examined for their inhibitory effects on the proliferation of various T-cell lines and PBMCs. Among the compounds, MN417 is a more potent inhibitor of ATL cells than TMNAA. This compound is a novel phenanthridinone derivative with the tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene structure. Interestingly, PN-H and MN314-B, which are also phenanthridinone derivatives but do not have the tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene structure, could not distinguish between HTLV-1-infected and uninfected T-cell lines in terms of their anti-proliferative activity. These results suggest that the tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene structure is required for the selective inhibition of HTLV-1-infected cells.
