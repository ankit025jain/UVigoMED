{"id":74009,"title":"Elastin peptides regulate HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell migration and invasion through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism.","abstract":"The elastin-derived peptides (EDPs) exert protumoural activities by potentiating the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and the plasminogen-plasmin activating system. In the present paper, we studied heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) involvement in this mechanism.HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell migration and invasion were studied in artificial wound assay and modified Boyden chamber assay, respectively. Heat-shock protein 90 was studied by western blot and immunofluorescence. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) were studied by gelatin Â± plasminogen zymography and immunofluorescence. Heat-shock protein 90 partners were studied by immunoprecipitation. Messenger RNA expression was studied using real-time PCR. Small interfering RNAs were used to confirm the essential role of Hsp90.We showed that kappa-elastin and VGVAPG elastin hexapeptide stimulated Hsp90, pro-MMP-2 and uPA secretion within 6 h, whereas AGVPGLGVG and GRKRK peptides had no effect. No increase of mRNA level was observed. Heat-shock protein 90-specific inhibitors inhibit EDP-stimulated HT-1080 cell-invasive capacity and restrained EDP-stimulated pro-MMP-2 and uPA secretions. The inhibitory effect was reproduced by using Hsp90-blocking antibody or Hsp90 knockdown by siRNA. Heat-shock protein 90 interacted with and stabilised uPA and pro-MMP-2 in conditioned culture media of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells.Taken together, our results demonstrate that EDPs exert protumoural activities through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism involving pro-MMP-2 and uPA.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874477","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Elastin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.814061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.799274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.765763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.732308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Urokinase","weight":0.606985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urokinase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.584601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Hsp90","weight":0.388203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsp90"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.366014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.201224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.090992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Fibrosarcoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosarcoma"},{"name":"Blocking antibody","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_antibody"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
