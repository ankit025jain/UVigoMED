{"id":83083,"title":"Peri-implant bone loss around single and multiple prostheses: systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess and compare the marginal bone loss around implants supporting single fixed prostheses and multiple-unit screw-retained prostheses.The literature was searched manually and electronically to identify studies in which the marginal peri-implant bone loss around single-implant prostheses and screw-retained multiple-implant prostheses was evaluated radiographically. Two reviewers independently selected the literature and extracted the data. The random-effects method was used to obtain estimates of marginal peri-implant bone loss (means and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]).Of the 2,107 studies identified by a preliminary search, 17 fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 7 were related to single-implant prostheses and 10 to multiple-implant screw-retained fixed prostheses. The mean marginal peri-implant bone loss was 0.9 mm (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.32 mm) for multiple-implant screw-retained prostheses and 0.58 mm (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.80 mm) for single-implant prostheses.This indirect comparison provided no evidence to support the assertion that there are differences in marginal peri-implant bone loss between single implant prostheses and multiple screw-retained prostheses.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451857","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.301619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.191485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.16178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.145181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.0628012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
