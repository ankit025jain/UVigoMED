{"id":83084,"title":"Clinicopathological features of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","abstract":"We aimed to examine the clinical usefulness of a new World Health Organization classification scheme for salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and to identify the factors most strongly associated with prognosis and outcome.The clinicopathological features of 45 patients who received treatment for mucoepidermoid carcinoma between 1986 and 2010 were retrospectively investigated.The overall disease-specific 5-year survival rate was 81.8 per cent. The rate for patients with low-grade tumours (92.5 per cent) was significantly higher than that for patients with intermediate or high-grade tumours (52.2 per cent). Univariate analysis revealed that five factors were significantly associated with five-year survival: age, tumour stage classification, lymph node status, histological grade and treatment method. Four factors were significant in multivariate analysis: age, sex, tumour stage classification and lymph node status.The new World Health Organization classification was useful in predicting disease progression in patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Patients with high-grade tumours or other prognostic factors positively associated with disease progression should be carefully evaluated and monitored.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451647","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.748068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.564695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucoepidermoid_carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Cent (currency)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)"},{"name":"Linnaean taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"}]}
