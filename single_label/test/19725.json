{"id":19725,"title":"Multiclonal spread of VIM-1-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolates associated with In624 and In488 integrons located in an IncHI2 plasmid.","abstract":"Over a 6-year period (2007-2012), the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae isolates resistant to ?-lactams and with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems was observed in Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain). To determine the possible role of metallo-?-lactamases (MBLs) in the resistance profile of these isolates, a molecular and clinical epidemiological study was performed, including determination of patients' clinical characteristics, genetic diversity of strains, resistance mechanisms to carbapenems, and the genetic environment of VIM-1. A total of 73 E. cloacae isolates showed resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and reduced susceptibility to at least one carbapenem during 2007-2012. PCR amplification revealed the presence of bla(VIM-1) gene in 37 isolates, bla(VIM-2) in 1 isolate and bla(KPC) in 5 isolates. Molecular typing showed high clonal diversity of E. cloacae isolates carrying bla(VIM-1). The genetic environment of bla(VIM-1) was investigated and two integron structures were found: intI-bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-dfrB1-aadA1-catB2-qacE?1/sul1 (In624); and intI-bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-aadA1-qacE?1/sul1 (In488). Isolates belonging to three clones (A, F and G) harboured different types of integron (In624 or In488) despite belonging to the same clone. Conjugal experiments showed an association with a conjugative plasmid of ca. 300 kb belonging to IncHI2 group, which is common in Spanish hospitals, suggesting that the widespread dissemination of bla(VIM-1) may be due to horizontal transfer of mobile genetic determinants rather than the result of spreading of a few clones. These results have implications for infection control programmes in the hospital.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702943","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.847604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.829553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacterial conjugation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.745746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.67154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.57196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.520539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.507254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Integron","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integron"},{"name":"Clonal colony","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_colony"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.194689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.153709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Enterobacter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacter"},{"name":"Madrid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cloaca","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"}]}
