{"id":69631,"title":"[Molecular genetic mechanisms of teratozoospermia].","abstract":"Teratozoospermia is one of the important factors contributing to male infertility, and its pathogenesis is not yet clear. Recent years have witnessed some progress in the researches on sperm morphology, and some genes have been confirmed to be correlated with spermatogenesis. Aiming to provide some evidence for the pathogenesis of teratozoospermia, this paper reviews the relevant literature in the past five years addressing such special teratozoospermia as globozoospermia, nuclear vacuoles, decapitated spermatozoa, excessive residual cytoplasm, dysplasia of the fibrous sheath, and primary ciliary dyskinesia, and elaborates on the molecular genetic mechanisms of DPY19L2, AR, PRM1, GBA2, PCI, CREM, TH2A, TH2B, ODF1, Cntrob, OAZ-t, HOOK1, SPEM1, GAT1, PRSS21, 15-LOX, Sptrx, AKAP3, AKAP4, DNAI1, DNAH5, RSPH4A, TXNDC3, CCDC39, LRRC6, LRRC50, KTU and so on. Meanwhile, this review also presents an overview on the latest advances in assisted reproductive technology and its outcomes in the treatment of teratozoospermia patients in order to provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital
