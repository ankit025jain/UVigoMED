{"id":79740,"title":"Comparative profile of circulating antigenic peptides in CSF, serum & urine from patients with neurocysticercosis diagnosed by immunoblotting.","abstract":"Traditionally serum and/or CSF specimens have been used for detection of either specific antibodies or antigens as a supportive diagnosis of NCC. However, in recent days, much interest has been shown employing noninvasive specimens such as urine. In our study, we identified and compared a profile of circulating antigenic peptides of parasite origin in three different body fluids (CSF, serum and urine) obtained from confirmed NCC cases and control subjects. The circulating antigenic peptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. For confirmation of their origin as parasite somatic or excretory secretory (ES) material, immunoreactivity was tested employing affinity purified polyclonal Taenia solium metacestode anti-somatic or ES antibodies, respectively. Only lower molecular weight antigenic peptides were found circulating in urine in contrast to serum and CSF specimens. Few somatic peptides were identified to be 100% specific for NCC (19·5 kDa in all three specimens; 131, 70 kDa in CSF and serum only; 128 kDa in CSF only). Similarly, the specific ES peptides detected were 32 kDa (in all three specimens), 16·5 kDa (in serum and CSF only), and 15 kDa (urine only). A test format detecting either one or more of these specific peptides would enhance the sensitivity in diagnosis of NCC.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965663","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.781434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Body fluid","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.611043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.554458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.548874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.5151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.402906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.371986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.269962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.156444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.14537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.136596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0906895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Neurocysticercosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocysticercosis"},{"name":"Taenia solium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_solium"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Radio format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_format"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"}]}
