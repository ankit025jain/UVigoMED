{"id":83173,"title":"Expression of fatty acid binding protein 4 is involved in the cell growth of oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of small and highly conserved lipid chaperone molecules with highly varied functions. Among them, fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4, also known as aP2) is highly expressed by adipocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Although the role of FABP4 in cancer is still unclear, it has been reported to be highly expressed by human tumors such as ovarian and bladder cancers. In the present study, we investigated the expression and role of FABP4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its expression in oral SCC tissues. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that FABP4 expression in the tumor tissue was much higher than that in the non-tumor area of the same specimen. In the inÂ vitro studies, an FABP4-knockdown SCC cell line (established through FABP4-specific siRNA) showed inhibited growth, and inhibited expression and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). These results indicate that expression of FABP4 plays an important role in the cell growth of oral SCC through the MAPK pathway.
