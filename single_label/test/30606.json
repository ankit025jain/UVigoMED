{"id":30606,"title":"HLA restriction of carbamazepine-specific T-Cell clones from an HLA-A*31:01-positive hypersensitive patient.","abstract":"HLA-A*31:01 is associated with carbamazepine (CBZ) hypersensitivity in Caucasian and Japanese populations. Herein, we show that HLA-A*31:01+ restricted the activation of carbamazepine-specific CD8(+) T-cells, which provides an immunological basis for the genetic association. Furthermore, CD4(+) T-cells were activated with carbamazepine in a HLA-DRB1*04:04-restricted manner, indicating that a common HLA haplotype may contribute to the multiclonal T-cell response seen in European patients with CBZ hypersensitivity.
