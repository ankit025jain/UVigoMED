{"id":55315,"title":"A randomized clinical trial comparing methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil for noninfectious uveitis.","abstract":"To compare the relative effectiveness of methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil for noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis.Multicenter, block-randomized, observer-masked clinical trial.Eighty patients with noninfectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis requiring corticosteroid-sparing therapy at Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai and Coimbatore, India.Patients were randomized to receive 25 mg weekly oral methotrexate or 1 g twice daily oral mycophenolate mofetil and were monitored monthly for 6 months. Oral prednisone and topical corticosteroids were tapered.Masked examiners assessed the primary outcome of treatment success, defined by achieving the following at 5 and 6 months: (1) ?0.5+ anterior chamber cells, ?0.5+ vitreous cells, ?0.5+ vitreous haze and no active retinal/choroidal lesions in both eyes, (2) ?10 mg of prednisone and ?2 drops of prednisolone acetate 1% a day, and (3) no declaration of treatment failure because of intolerability or safety. Additional outcomes included time to sustained corticosteroid-sparing control of inflammation, change in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, resolution of macular edema, adverse events, subgroup analysis by anatomic location, and medication adherence.Forty-one patients were randomized to methotrexate and 39 to mycophenolate mofetil. A total of 67 patients (35 methotrexate, 32 mycophenolate mofetil) contributed to the primary outcome. Sixty-nine percent of patients achieved treatment success with methotrexate and 47% with mycophenolate mofetil (P = 0.09). Treatment failure from adverse events or tolerability was not different by treatment arm (P = 0.99). There were no differences between treatment groups in time to corticosteroid-sparing control of inflammation (P = 0.44), change in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.68), or resolution of macular edema (P = 0.31).There was no statistically significant difference in corticosteroid-sparing control of inflammation between patients receiving methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. However, there was a 22% difference in treatment success favoring methotrexate.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917273","annotations":[{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Mycophenolate mofetil","weight":0.64303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolate_mofetil"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.604279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.573047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.414804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.378259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"India","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.235635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"}]}
