{"id":61589,"title":"[Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis presenting as livedo racemosa].","abstract":"As a rare antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome) is characterized by asthma, severe peripheral eosinophilia and the presence of extravascular granulomas. Cutaneous involvement usually includes palpable purpura or cutaneous to subcutaneous nodes. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with EPGA and the unusual cutaneous manifestation of livedo racemosa.
