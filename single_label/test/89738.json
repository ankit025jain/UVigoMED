{"id":89738,"title":"Assisted movement with proprioceptive stimulation reduces impairment and restores function in incomplete spinal cord injury.","abstract":"To test whether treatment with assisted movement with enhanced sensation (AMES) using vibration to the antagonist muscle would reduce impairments and restore upper limb function in people with incomplete tetraplegia.Prospective, pre-post study.Laboratory and rehabilitation hospital.We recruited 15 arms from 10 individuals (8 men; mean age, 40.5 y; mean years postspinal cord injury [SCI], 3) with chronic, incomplete tetraplegia.Two or three 20-minute sessions per week over 9 to 13 weeks (25 sessions total) on the AMES device, which combines repeated movement with targeted vibration to the antagonist muscle.Strength and active motion tests on the AMES device; International Standards for the Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) motor and sensory examinations; Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS); grasp and release test (GRT); Van Lieshout Test (VLT); and Capabilities of Upper Extremity questionnaire (CUE).The AMES strength test scores improved significantly in metacarpophalangeal flexion (P=.024) and extension (P=.007) and wrist flexion (P=.001) and extension (P<.000). The AMES active motion scores improved in the hand (P=.001) and wrist (P=.001). The MAS and ISNCSCI scores remained unchanged, whereas the GRT scores increased (P=.025). Post hoc analysis showed a trend from pre- to posttreatment (P=.068) and a significant change from pretreatment to 3-month follow-up (P=.046). There was no significant change in the VLT (P=.951) or the CUE (P=.164). Five of the 10 participants reported a return of sensation to the digits after the first, second, or third treatment session.People with chronic, incomplete tetraplegia may experience improvements in impairments and function after treatment on a device combining assisted movement and proprioceptive stimulation. Further investigation is warranted.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685386","annotations":[{"name":"Physical
