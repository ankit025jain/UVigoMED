{"id":90187,"title":"External fixation of the hand: a simple approach to comminuted proximal interphalangeal joint fractures.","abstract":"Proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) fractures are a treatment challenge for hand surgeons. Poor treatment options may lead to stiffness, non-union and markedly reduced range of movement (ROM). We describe our experience using the Hoffman-2 micro static external fixation device (Stryker) in a case series of ten patients with closed comminuted intra-articular PIPJ fractures. The use of this device in the management of these fractures has not previously been described. The mean total active motion (TAM) of the injured joint had recovered to 80% of normal at the six-month follow up.
