{"id":89094,"title":"Unintentional injury mortality among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States, 1990-2009.","abstract":"We describe the burden of unintentional injury (UI) deaths among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States.National Death Index records for 1990 to 2009 were linked with Indian Health Service registration records to identify AI/AN deaths misclassified as non-AI/AN deaths. Most analyses were restricted to Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties in 6 geographic regions of the United States. We compared age-adjusted death rates for AI/AN persons with those for Whites; Hispanics were excluded.From 2005 to 2009, the UI death rate for AI/AN people was 2.4 times higher than for Whites. Death rates for the 3 leading causes of UI death-motor vehicle traffic crashes, poisoning, and falls-were 1.4 to 3 times higher among AI/AN persons than among Whites. UI death rates were higher among AI/AN males than among females and highest among AI/AN persons in Alaska, the Northern Plains, and the Southwest.AI/AN persons had consistently higher UI death rates than did Whites. This disparity in overall rates coupled with recent increases in unintentional poisoning deaths requires that injury prevention be a major priority for improving health and preventing death among AI/AN populations.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754624","annotations":[{"name":"Alaska Natives","weight":0.779189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives"},{"name":"Alaska","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.619954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.548215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.502276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Great Plains","weight":0.495518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.490614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.484219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Indian Health Service","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Health_Service"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.334413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.276948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Southwestern United States","weight":0.181818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"List of regions of the United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"Information Technology Infrastructure Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library"},{"name":"University of Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa"},{"name":"Unclassified language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclassified_language"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Major (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Delivery (commerce)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(commerce)"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"}]}
