{"id":63855,"title":"Hsa-miR-15a and Hsa-miR-16-1 expression is not related to proliferation centers abundance and other prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","abstract":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) is the commonest leukemia in adults. Here, we aimed to evaluate hsa-miR-15a/hsa-miR-16-1 expression in CLL tissues by qPCR and correlate it with the other clinicopathological features and clinical outcome. 40 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lymph node samples obtained from CLL/SLL patients were classified into two categories, \"PCs rich\" and \"typical.\" We found a significant common expression level of 4 miRNAs; however, we did not find any significant relationship between PCs presence and miRNAs expression. Moreover, neither the presence of 13q deletion nor the percentage of cells carrying the deletion strictly correlated with miRNAs expression levels, although a significant number of patients with 13q deletion presented hsa-miR-16-1-3p levels below the median value in normal samples (P < 0.05). Finally, although no correlation was found between the expression of each miRNA and other clinicopathological features (Ki67, CD38, ZAP70, and IGVH@ hypermutations), the OS curves showed a positive trend in patients with miRNAs downregulation, though not statistically significant. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that all miRNAs can be successfully studied in FFPE CLL tissues and that del13q and PCs richness do not strictly correspond to miRNAs downregulation; therefore, a specific evaluation may be envisaged at least in patients enrolled in clinical trials.
