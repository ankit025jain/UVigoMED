{"id":87041,"title":"[Significance of the individual helio-climatic factors in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome morbidity formation of population in the district of military units dislocation].","abstract":"Been outlined the experience of mathematics modelling of natural phenomena for determination of the impact of individual factors and their combination on the epidemic process development. Found that 97,9% of the variation of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome index of population in the study area determine six climatic factors: the Wolf number, rainfall in November, the highest level of the river during floods, the temperature of air in October, the maximum and minimum levels of snow cover in February. As the most significant factors, contributing to the spread of the disease under study, been determine the parameters of air temperature and the height of snow. In the troops proposed to use approved methodology of mathematics modelling to predict changes of epidemiological situation for the disease and for timely organization of preventive measures to avoid introduction of infection in military units.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051789","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.564624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.518915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Rain","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"River","weight":0.239558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Hantavirus","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hantavirus"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Snow","weight":0.129465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.116678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Flood","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood"},{"name":"Gray wolf","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.039935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Natural phenomenon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_phenomenon"},{"name":"Viral hemorrhagic fever","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Military organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_organization"}]}
