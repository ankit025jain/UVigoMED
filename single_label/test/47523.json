{"id":47523,"title":"Documented quality of care in certified colorectal cancer centers in Germany: German Cancer Society benchmarking report for 2013.","abstract":"In order to improve the quality of treatment for cancer patients the German Cancer Society (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft) implemented a certification system for oncological care institutions. The certified colorectal cancer centers present the structures, processes and results of their network in the framework of an auditing procedure.The current benchmarking report by the certified centers reflects the centers' reference results over a period of 3 years. The figures included in the benchmarking report reflect the areas of interdisciplinary collaboration, guideline-compliant treatment, and expertise of the main treatment partners.High percentages were shown for indicators reflecting pretreatment and postoperative case presentations in multidisciplinary team meetings (91.8 % or 98.1 %), psycho-oncologic care (54.8 %) as well as social service counseling (77.1 %). Good quality of the TME rectal specimen and adequate lymph-node retrieval (12 lymph nodes at least) was achieved by 93 % or 96.6 % of the centers. Adjuvant chemotherapy (colon, Union for International Cancer Control [UICC] stage III) or neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (rectum, UICC stages II and III) received 73.7 % or 80 % of relevant patients. Quotas of anastomotic leakage in the colon or rectum were 4.4 % or 7.6 %, whereas postoperative mortality amounted to 2.6 %.The present analysis of the results, together with the centers' statements and the auditors' reports, shows that most of the targets for indicator figures are being better met over the course of time. In addition, however, there is a clear potential for improvement and the centers are verifiably addressing this. A transparent presentation of the quality of care and reflection on and discussion of the results among the treatment partners in the certified network and with the auditors during the certification process may contribute to constant quality improvement in oncological care.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584335","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.788518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.71776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.651464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.633577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.550591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.497666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.484948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.482205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.416523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.153714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"International Union Against Cancer","weight":0.112294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_Against_Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
