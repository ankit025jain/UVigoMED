{"id":19011,"title":"Synthesis, spectroscopic, anticancer and antibacterial studies of Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes with 2-carboxybenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone.","abstract":"Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (L) were synthesized and investigated by their spectral and analytical data. These newly synthesized complexes have a composition of M(L)X(H2O)2 (where M=Ni(II), Cu(II) and X=Cl(-), NO3(-), CH3COO(-)) and (L) is the tridentate Schiff base ligand. The ligand and its complexes have been characterized on the basis of analytical, molar conductivity, magnetic susceptibility measurements, FT-IR, ESR, (1)H NMR and electronic spectral analysis. All the compounds were non-electrolytic in nature. On the basis of spectral studies an octahedral geometry has been assigned for Ni(II) and a tetragonal geometry for Cu(II) complexes. The ligand and its metal complexes were screened for their anticancer studies against human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and calculated minimum inhibitory concentration and also for antibacterial activity using Kirby-Bauer single disk susceptibility test.
