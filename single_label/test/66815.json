{"id":66815,"title":"Estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria: diagnosis, staging, and prognosis.","abstract":"To describe the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and important outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The first part of the review presents the evidence linking eGFR and albuminuria to important clinical outcomes, and the second part highlights the importance of these risk relationships across multiple subgroups and in clinical risk prediction.Investigators have used data from large population-based cohort studies and conducted collaborative meta-analyses to definitively establish the relationship between eGFR, albuminuria, and adverse clinical outcomes. Recent systematic reviews have also highlighted the importance of these variables in predicting the risk of kidney failure and all-cause mortality.eGFR and albuminuria are important independent risk factors for kidney failure, acute kidney injury, and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. These relationships are independent of age, sex, race, or ethnicity. eGFR and albuminuria can be combined with other demographic variables to accurately predict the risk of kidney failure and should be measured concurrently to determine diagnosis, staging, and prognosis in patients with CKD.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675138","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.804766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.762097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.652639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.490664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.314089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.104468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0218275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Predictive analytics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
