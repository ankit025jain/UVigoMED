{"id":37251,"title":"Disease-related intestinal transplant in adults: results from a single center.","abstract":"Intestinal transplantation is gaining worldwide acceptance as the main option for patients with irreversible intestinal failure and complicated total parenteral nutrition course. In adults, the main cause is still represented by short bowel syndrome, but tumors (Gardner syndrome) and dismotility disorders (chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction [CIPO]) have been treated increasingly by this kind of transplantation procedure. We reviewed our series from the disease point of view: although SBS confirmed results achieved in previous years, CIPO is nowadays demonstrating an excellent outcome similar to other transplantation series. Our results showed indeed that recipients affected by Gardner syndrome must be carefully selected before the disease is to advanced to take advantage of the transplantation procedure.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507060","annotations":[{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Short bowel syndrome","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.620849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Gardner's syndrome","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner's_syndrome"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intestinal pseudoobstruction","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_pseudoobstruction"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Popular Indigenous Council of Oaxaca \"Ricardo Flores Magon\"","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Indigenous_Council_of_Oaxaca_\"Ricardo_Flores_Magon\""},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"}]}
