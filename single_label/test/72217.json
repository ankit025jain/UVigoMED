{"id":72217,"title":"[Mechanism of antitumor effect of ursolic acid on T (8;21) leukemia cell kasumi-1].","abstract":"This study was purposed to investigate the anti-tumor effect of ursolic acid (UA) on t(8;21) leukemia cell line kasumi-1 and its possible mechanisms. The kasumi-1 cells were treated with UA at different concentration for different duration of time. The growth inhibition of kasumi-1 treated with UA was detected by using CCK-8 test, and the morphological changes of kasumi-1 cells were observed by Wright's staining. Furthermore, the apoptosis rate of kasumi-1 was examined by flow cytometry. Lastly, the expression of AML1-ETO, KIT, MYC, CCND1, BCL-2, P53, BAX, MDM2 and protein were detected by using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot respectively. The results showed that the UA obviously inhibited the growth of kasumi-1 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. The apoptotic morphological changes of cells were presented when kasumi-1 cells were treated with UA for 48 hours. The apoptotic rate of kasumi-1 cells increased in a dose- and time-dependent ways, and the mRNA levels of AML1-ETO, KIT, MYC, CCND1, BCL2, MDM2 decreased in kasumi-1 cells treated with UA, as well as the protein levels. Meanwhile, UA up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of P53 in the same manner. It is concluded that UA can exert its anti-tumor effect by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of kasumi-1 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manners, that may provide the clues for a new targeting therapy to t(8;21) leukemia.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989277","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mdm2","weight":0.681063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdm2"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.668255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"CD117","weight":0.642546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD117"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.470048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.246059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.244962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
