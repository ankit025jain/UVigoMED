{"id":43992,"title":"Antioxidant effect of N-acetylcysteine on prehepatic portal hypertensive gastropathy in rats.","abstract":"Portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome associated with the development of a hyperdynamic circulation and gastroesophageal varices. Aim. To evaluate the antioxidant effect of N-acetylcysteine on portal hypertensive rats.Portal hypertension was induced by partial portal vein ligation (PPVL). Oxidative damage in the stomach was measured by lipoperoxidation trough thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and antioxidant enzyme activity; we also evaluated nitrates and nitrites level and histology stained by hematoxylin-eosin. We performed evaluation of portal pressure and measurement of vessels diameter. Liver damage was evaluated by measuring hepatic enzymes. The animals were divided in four experimental groups (n = 6): Sham-operated (SO), SO + NAC, Partial portal vein ligation (PPVL) and PPVL + NAC. N-acetylcysteine (10 mg/kg ip) was administered daily for 7 days and started 8 days after surgery.The portal hypertensive group showed an increase in portal pressure, vessels diameter, levels of TBARS and nitrates and nitrites when compared to SO group. These values were accompanied by a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) antioxidant enzyme activity. Histology showed dilated vessels in the gastric mucosa in the PPVL group. NAC was able to decrease portal pressure values, vessels diameter, TBARS and also nitrates and nitrites levels when compared to PPVL group. Furthermore, PPVL+NAC group presented an increase in SOD and GPx activity. N-acetylcysteine attenuated damage in gastric mucosa.Oxidative stress is associated with portal hypertension and that antioxidant NAC is able to minimize damages of PPVL in rats.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System
