{"id":11428,"title":"Development of a new real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect Duck adenovirus A DNA and application to samples from Swiss poultry flocks.","abstract":"Between 2008 and 2012, commercial Swiss layer and layer breeder flocks experiencing problems in laying performance were sampled and tested for infection with Duck adenovirus A (DAdV-A; previously known as Egg drop syndrome 1976 virus). Organ samples from birds sent for necropsy as well as blood samples from living animals originating from the same flocks were analyzed. To detect virus-specific DNA, a newly developed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method was applied, and the presence of antibodies against DAdV-A was tested using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In 5 out of 7 investigated flocks, viral DNA was detected in tissues. In addition, antibodies against DAdV-A were detected in all of the flocks.
