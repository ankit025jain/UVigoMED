{"id":22461,"title":"Clinical features of 705 Borrelia burgdorferi seropositive patients in an endemic area of northern Italy.","abstract":"Lyme Borreliosis is a multisystemic infection caused by spirochetes of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The features of Lyme Borreliosis may differ in the various geographical areas, primarily between the manifestations found in America and those found in Europe and Asia.to describe the clinical features of Lyme Borreliosis in an endemic geographic area such as Friuli-Venezia Giulia in the Northeastern part of Italy.The medical records of patients resulted seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi have been retrospectively recorded and analyzed.Seven hundred and five patients met the inclusion criteria, 363 males and 342 females. Erythema migrans was the most common manifestation, detected in 437 patients. Other classical cutaneous manifestations included 58 cases of multiple erythema migrans, 7 lymphadenosis benigna cutis, and 18 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. The musculoskeletal system was involved in 511 patients. Four hundred and sixty patients presented a neurological involvement. Flu-like symptoms preceded or accompanied or were the only clinical feature in 119 patients.The manifestations of Lyme borreliosis recorded in this study are similar to the ones of other endemic areas in Europe, even if there are some peculiar features which are different from those reported in Northern Europe and in the USA.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550705","annotations":[{"name":"Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrodermatitis_chronica_atrophicans"},{"name":"Borrelia burgdorferi","weight":0.829802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia_burgdorferi"},{"name":"Erythema chronicum migrans","weight":0.810842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_chronicum_migrans"},{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Spirochaete","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirochaete"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.750636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.630503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Sensu","weight":0.473233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensu"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.443158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.358779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.28629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Borrelia","weight":0.16279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Lyme, Connecticut","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme,_Connecticut"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Northern Hemisphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Northern Italy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"}]}
