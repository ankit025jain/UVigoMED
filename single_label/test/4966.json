{"id":4966,"title":"Intravesical foreign body as a result of self catheterization: case report.","abstract":"Foreign bodies inside urinary tract are a relatively rare condition in our practice. There are several reports published and in most cases the reason for self insertion of an object was autoerotic stimulation or psychiatric illness. Self treatment by homemade instruments is a rarely seen scenario. A 62-year-old man presented to our department complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms. On examination, a foreign body was detected inside the urinary bladder. Urethral stricture was also detected for which the patient had been previously treated on several occasions. The patient stated that he had attempted self catheterization using a homemade catheter. He had succeeded in emptying his bladder; however, the catheter entered the bladder completely and was irretrievable to him. Sachse urethrotomy was performed following retrieval of the foreign body. No psychiatric illness was detected in our patient. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509248","annotations":[{"name":"Masturbation","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.761238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Urethrotomy","weight":0.678936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethrotomy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.447847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Sexual stimulation","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_stimulation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Autoeroticism","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoeroticism"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Urethral foreign body","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_foreign_body"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
