{"id":85975,"title":"Validation of EORTC QLQ-LC43 for Chinese patients with lung cancer.","abstract":"To test the validity, reliability and acceptability of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 43 (EORTC QLQ-LC43) for Chinese patients with lung cancer.Patients from Tianjin Cancer Institution and Hospital with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. All were treated in Tianjin Cancer Institution and Hospital from December 2012 to April 2013. All participants self-administered the EORTC QLQ-LC43 and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). The Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) was performed to evaluate scores. Reliability test of the questionnaires was based on Cronbach's ? coefficients, Pearson correlation test and Kruskal-Wallis test.This study included 317 inpatients and outpatients. The Cronbach's ? coefficients were >0.70 in all scales of the two questionnaires, except that of cognitive functioning. High correlations were found among the quality of life (QoL), physical functioning, role functioning, dyspnea, and KPS scores (r>0.40). Mild correlations were discovered among the rest of the items. Dividing the participants into three groups based on the KPS scores showed that QoL and functional scales scores progressively decreased and the symptom items scores progressively increased as KPS scores decreased. All inter-group differences were statistically significant (P<0.05).The EORTC QLQ-LC43 is a reliable and valid instrument in patients with lung cancer and is appropriate for measuring the QoL of Chinese patients.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831272","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.65,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.58647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.571231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.544286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.515908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"China","weight":0.503927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.455767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tianjin","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"EORTC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EORTC"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Debunker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debunker"}]}
