{"id":81413,"title":"The effect of nutrition on periodontal disease: a systematic review.","abstract":"The link between nutrients and periodontal disease has not been clearly established. A PubMed and Cochrane database literature search was conducted. The published research reveals only a possible relationship between vitamins and minerals and periodontal disease. Vitamin E, zinc, lycopene and vitamin B complex may have useful adjunct benefits. However, there is inadequate evidence to link the nutritional status of the host to periodontal inflammation. More randomized controlled trials are needed to explore this association.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087348","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Lycopene","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.769431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.731918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.645183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.428656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.222613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
