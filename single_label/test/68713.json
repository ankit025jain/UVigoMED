{"id":68713,"title":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists in a battle against the aging kidney.","abstract":"As aging is a complex phenomenon characterized by intraindividual and interindividual diversities in the maintenance of the homeostatic condition of cells and tissues, changes in renal function are not uniform and depend on associated diseases and environmental factors. Multiple studies have investigated the possible underlying mechanisms of age-related decline in kidney function. Evolutionary, molecular, cellular and systemic theories have been postulated to explain the primary disease independent age-related changes and adaptive responses. As peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are involved in a broad spectrum of biological processes, PPAR activation might have an effect on the prevention of cell senescence. In this review, we will focus on the experimental and clinical evidence of PPAR agonists in a battle against the aging kidney.
