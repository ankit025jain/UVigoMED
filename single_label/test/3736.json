{"id":3736,"title":"Linkage of 1986-2009 National Health Interview Survey with 1981-2010 Florida Cancer Data System.","abstract":"National survey data linked with state cancer registry data has the potential to create a valuable tool for cancer prevention and control research. A pilot project-developed in a collaboration of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS) at the University of Miami -links the records of the 1986-2009 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 1981-2010 FCDS. The project assesses the feasibility of performing a record linkage between NCHS survey data and a state-based cancer registry, as well as the value of the data produced. The linked NHIS-FCDS data allow researchers to follow NHIS survey participants longitudinally to examine factors associated with future cancer diagnosis, and to assess the characteristics and quality of life among cancer survivors.This report provides a preliminary evaluation of the linked national and state cancer data and examines both analytic issues and complications presented by the linkage.Residential mobility and the number of years of data linked in this project create some analytic challenges and limitations for the types of analyses that can be conducted. However, the linked data set offers the ability to conduct analyses not possible with either data set alone.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25406513","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.753549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"National Center for Health Statistics","weight":0.685059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Health_Statistics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Miami","weight":0.473483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami"},{"name":"University of Miami","weight":0.368656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Record linkage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"New Hampshire Motor Speedway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Motor_Speedway"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Longitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Analytic philosophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Medical statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_statistics"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Linked Data","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
