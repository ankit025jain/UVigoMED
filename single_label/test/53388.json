{"id":53388,"title":"Expansion of anti-mesothelin specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in patients with pancreatic carcinoma.","abstract":"We aimed to assess the status of naturally occurring CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses to a tumour associated antigen, Mesothelin, in patients with pancreatic carcinoma and study the effects of elevated IL-10 on Mesothelin-specific T cell responses. For that sake, short term T cell lines were generated from PBMCs of 16 healthy controls, 15 patients with benign pancreatic diseases and 25 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and Mesothelin-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses were analysed using intracellular cytokine assays for IFN-?. Plasma levels of IL-10 and Mesothelin were measured using cytometric bead array and ELISA assay, respectively. The blocking assays were performed to assess the effects of IL-10 on Mesothelin-specific T cell responses. Here, we demonstrate that the plasma levels of Mesothelin and IL-10 are significantly increased in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Additionally, we found that (a) Mesothelin-specific T cell responses are significantly expanded in cancer patients (p = 0.0053), (b) the multifunctional CD4(+) T cell response is directed toward a broad repertoire of epitopes within the Mesothelin protein. (c) Mesothelin-specific CD4+ T cell response is directly inhibited by elevated IL-10 in cancer patients. These data provides evidence for the use of Mesothelin as an immunogen for tumour-specific T cell response.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520352","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.844502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.751807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.716916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.631552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.28029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Sake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"}]}
