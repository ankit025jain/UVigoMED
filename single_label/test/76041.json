{"id":76041,"title":"Comparison of two exploratory dietary patterns in association with the metabolic syndrome in a Northern German population.","abstract":"Diet is related to many chronic disease conditions such as the metabolic syndrome (MetS). We set out to compare behaviour-related with disease-related patterns and their association with the MetS in a German cross-sectional study. A total of 905 participants of a Northern German cohort (aged 25-82 years) completed a FFQ, underwent anthropometric assessments and provided a blood sample. Dietary patterns were derived by principal component analysis (PCA) and reduced-rank regression (RRR) from forty-two food groups. Components of the MetS were used as response variables for the RRR analysis. Simplified patterns comprising ten food groups were generated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the likelihood of having the MetS across the quartiles of simplified pattern scores. We identified two similar dietary patterns derived by PCA and RRR characterised by high intakes of potatoes, various vegetables, red and processed meat, fats, sauce and bouillon. Comparing simplified patterns, an increased RRR pattern score was associated with a higher OR (2·18, 95% CI 1·25, 3·81) of having the MetS than an increased PCA pattern score (OR 1·92, 95% CI 1·21, 3·03). Comparing concordant food groups by both dietary pattern methods, a diet high in legumes, beef, processed meat and bouillon was also positively associated with the prevalence of the MetS after adjustment for potential confounders (OR 1·71, 95% CI 1·04, 2·79). We identified a behaviour-related pattern that was positively associated with the MetS. The application of both dietary pattern methods may be advantageous to obtain information for designing and realising dietary guidelines. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the results.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313577","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"Beef","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.668446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.592294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Legume","weight":0.485564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.327561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Potato","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.252321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.230489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.138141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Sauce","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Food group","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Germans","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
