{"id":4730,"title":"Third Class Resolver: a retrospective analysis.","abstract":"To evaluate the use of Third Class Resolver (TCR), a new fixed and functional orthopaedic appliance for the treatment of skeletal Class III malocclusion in adolescents and young adults.Study design: Retrospective analysis. Twenty subjects, 10 females and 10 males, affected by Class III malocclusion were treated with a new fixed orthopaedic appliance: the Third Class Resolver (TCR). The mean age was 7 years at the beginning of treatment and 9 years at the end of treatment. The mean treatment time was 6 months. Digital cephalometric superimpositions on lateral radiographs taken at the start and end of treatment were assessed. The cephalometric values were statistically analysed.Cephalometric analysis of changes during treatment shows a statistically significant increase of ANB angle (mean 1°) (P = 0.045); increase of Witts Index (mean 3.5 mm) (P = 0.003); decrease of Maxillo-Mandibular angle (MM) (mean -2.3°) (P = 0.047); increase of Upper incisor-Maxilla Plane angle (angle mean 10.5°) (P = 0.02); increase of the distance between Upper Incisor and A-Pg line (mean 2.4 mm) (P = 0.021); increase of the mandibular branch length (mean 4.8 mm) (P = 0.004).TCR can be used fully for treatment of Class III malocclusions.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306153","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.487163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.427379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.384663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.1621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.11378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Cephalometric analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometric_analysis"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"Mandibular nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_nerve"},{"name":"TV Asahi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Asahi"},{"name":"Petty Officer Third Class","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_Officer_Third_Class"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Uncial 047","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_047"},{"name":"Resolver (Veruca Salt album)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolver_(Veruca_Salt_album)"}]}
