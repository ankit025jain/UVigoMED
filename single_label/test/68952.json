{"id":68952,"title":"Increased risk of acute kidney injury associated with higher infusion rate of mannitol in patients with intracranial hemorrhage.","abstract":"Mannitol, an osmotic agent used to decrease intracranial pressure, can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). The objectives of this study were to assess the impact of mannitol on the incidence and severity of AKI and to identify risk factors and outcome for AKI in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).The authors retrospectively evaluated 153 adult patients who received mannitol infusion after ICH between January 2005 and December 2009 in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for AKI after ICH. Based on the odds ratio, weighted scores were assigned to predictors of AKI.The overall incidence of AKI among study participants was 10.5% (n = 16). Acute kidney injury occurred more frequently in patients who received mannitol infusion at a rate ? 1.34 g/kg/day than it did in patients who received mannitol infusion at a rate < 1.34 g/kg/day. A higher mannitol infusion rate was associated with more severe AKI. Independent risk factors for AKI were mannitol infusion rate ? 1.34 g/kg/day, age ? 70 years, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ? 110 mm Hg, and glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The authors developed a risk model for AKI, wherein patients with a higher risk score showed a graded association with a higher incidence of AKI.The incidence of AKI following mannitol infusion in patients with ICH was 10.5%. A higher mannitol infusion rate was associated with more frequent and more severe AKI. Additionally, age ? 70 years, DBP ? 110 mm Hg, and established renal dysfunction before starting mannitol therapy were associated with development of AKI.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484224","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Mannitol","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannitol"},{"name":"Intracranial hemorrhage","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.800917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Osmosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.498791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.383167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.133824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0834668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
