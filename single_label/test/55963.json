{"id":55963,"title":"Retinal vessel oxygen saturation in giant cell arteritis patients without ocular symptoms.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine subclinical ocular ischemia related to giant cell arteritis (GCA) by means of retinal oximetry (RO) measurements.Four test-retest RO images per eye were taken with the retinal vessel analyser (IMEDOS Systems UG, Jena). RO measurements in arterial (A-SO2) and venous (V-SO2) retinal vessels and their difference (A-V SO2) were calculated in GCA patients and compared to those of age-matched controls.GCA biopsy and duplex sonography positive patients (n=8, 13 eyes) from the Basler Riesenzellarteriitis Kohorte study (BARK) were recruited. In controls (n=6, 10 eyes), the mean (± SD) A-SO2 and V-SO2 were measured at 93.89% (± 3.0) and at 55.60% (± 3.4), respectively. In the GCAs, a reduction in the A-SO2 to 93.37% (± 3.3) and an increase in V-SO2 to 61.13% (± 3.6) were found. The A-V SO2 difference was reduced in the GCAs to 32.24% (± 3.8) whereas in the controls the difference was 38.31% (± 2.8).Oxygen metabolism is affected in cases with GCA. Thus, RO may provide additional data in the diagnosis of GCA, even when no ophthalmic symptoms have been reported.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771188","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Giant cell arteritis","weight":0.831221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell_arteritis"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.566486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.4372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.20298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Arteritis","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteritis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bark","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Automated analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_analyser"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Atrioventricular node","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_node"},{"name":"Amaury Sport Organisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaury_Sport_Organisation"},{"name":"Sulfur dioxide","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Undergraduate education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Jena","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena"}]}
