{"id":65683,"title":"MR imaging of the urinary bladder.","abstract":"MR imaging is the modality of choice for accurate local staging of bladder cancer. In addition, bladder MR imaging helps detect lymph node involvement, and in conjunction with computed tomography, provides complete staging. Familiarity with optimal imaging protocols, normal urinary bladder anatomy, and pathologic MR imaging appearances is essential for the radiologist. Evolving techniques, such as use of diffusion-weighted imaging and lymphotropic nanoparticle-enhanced MR imaging, may further enhance the ability of MR imaging in local and nodal staging.
