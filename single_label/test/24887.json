{"id":24887,"title":"Aortic dissections and aneurysms. Prehospital care of these rare but life-threatening emergencies.","abstract":"Aortic dissections and aneurysms are seen with low frequency and have high risk for deterioration during prehospital care. It is essential to include both dissections and aneurysms in your differential diagnoses whenever evaluating patients with chest or abdominal complaints. Often a good history is the best indication of one of these grave vascular emergencies. Consider thoracic aortic dissection in your differential diagnosis for any patient who complains of chest pain and aortic aneurysm in patients who have any sort of abdominal discomfort or syncope with an unknown etiology. When either is suspected transport rapidly to a facility with cardiothoracic and vascular surgery capability, and provide care that prepares you to manage the patient quickly should a rupture occur.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25276895","annotations":[{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.86437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Cardiothoracic surgery","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiothoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Vascular surgery","weight":0.652132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_surgery"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.564214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.466278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.24212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.171154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0460588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Grave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
