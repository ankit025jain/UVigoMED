{"id":27960,"title":"Barriers to accessing substance abuse treatment in Mexico: national comparative analysis by migration status.","abstract":"We examined Mexican migrants' perceived barriers to entering substance abuse treatment and potential differences by gender.This study analyzed a subset of household data collected in Mexico in 2011 via the Encuesta Nacional de Adicciones (National Survey of Addictions). A sample of 1,143 individuals who reported using illicit drugs was analyzed using multivariate negative binomial models to determine direct and moderated relationships of gender, migrant status, and drug dependence with perceived barriers to accessing treatment.Significant findings included disparities in drug dependence by migrant status. Compared with non-migrant men, women who have traveled to the United States was associated with fewer (1.3) barriers to access treatment. Fewer barriers to access care were associated with individuals residing in other regions of the country, compared to those living in Mexico City.Drug dependence, gender, migration status and regional location are factors associated with access to needed treatment. Implications for health care policy to develop treatment services infrastructure and for future research are discussed in the context of ongoing drug policy reform in Mexico.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074067","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mexico City","weight":0.713027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.444951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.419357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.353247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.23047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.174482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Reform","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform"},{"name":"Drug policy reform","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_reform"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Drug policy","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Binomial nomenclature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Chairman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"}]}
