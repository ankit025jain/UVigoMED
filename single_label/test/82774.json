{"id":82774,"title":"In vitro remineralizing effect of fluoride varnishes containing sodium trimetaphosphate.","abstract":"This study analyzed the effects of fluoride varnishes supplemented with sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) on the remineralization of caries-like lesions in vitro. Bovine enamel discs were selected through surface hardness (SH) and caries-like lesions were induced. SH was again determined and the blocks were divided into 7 experimental groups (n = 24/group): placebo (no fluoride or TMP), 5% TMP, 2.5% NaF, 2.5% NaF/5% TMP, 5% NaF, 5% NaF/5% TMP and commercial formulation (Duraphatâ„¢, 5% NaF), following a blind protocol. Discs were treated with the varnishes and kept in a remineralizing solution for 4 h and a demineralizing solution for 2 h. Varnishes were then removed and half of the discs were used for analysis of loosely (CaF2) and firmly bound fluoride. The remaining discs were submitted to a pH-cycling regimen for 6 days. The percentage of surface hardness recovery (%SHR), cross-sectional hardness (?KHN) and enamel CaF2 and fluoride were determined. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and by Student-Newman-Keuls' test (p < 0.05). A dose-response relationship was observed between fluoride concentrations in the varnishes and %SHR. The 5% TMP varnish led to %SHR similar to that obtained for the placebo. When TMP was used in association with fluoride, however, significantly higher %SHR were observed in comparison with their counterparts without TMP. Moreover, ?KHN obtained for the 5% NaF/5% TMP was significantly lower among all groups tested. Higher concentrations of CaF2 and fluoride were observed for Duraphat and 5% NaF, followed by 5% NaF/5% TMP, 2.5% NaF and 2.5% NaF/5% TMP (p < 0.05). It was concluded that the supplementation of fluoride varnishes with TMP leads to enhanced remineralizing effect of artificial caries lesions in vitro.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526110","annotations":[{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.710504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.602239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.400501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.373598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Varnish","weight":0.352705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.297039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.129709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Sodium trimetaphosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_trimetaphosphate"},{"name":"Remineralisation of teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation_of_teeth"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Vickers hardness test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_hardness_test"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_formulation"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Shropshire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire"},{"name":"Television advertisement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"}]}
