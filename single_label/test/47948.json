{"id":47948,"title":"OCT-1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with well-differentiated gastric cancer.","abstract":"Octamer transcription factor-1 (OCT-1) is a well-known transcription factor that is reportedly overexpressed in intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma in the intestine. In this study, we investigated OCT-1 overexpression as a prognostic factor for gastric cancer. The association between OCT-1 overexpression (detected using immunohistochemistry) and clinicopathological features including survival was evaluated. In vitro gain-of-function approaches were utilized to assess the function of OCT-1 in malignancy. Analysis of OCT-1 expression in patients with gastric cancer with well-differentiated carcinoma as per the World Health Organization classification showed that OCT-1 overexpression was correlated with advanced tumor invasion (58.8 % of patients with advanced tumor invasion vs. 21.2 % of patients with early tumor invasion; p<0.01), lymph node metastasis (63.9 % of patients with metastasis vs. 24.1 % of those without; p=0.015), and cancer recurrence (83.3 % of patients with recurrence vs. 25.4 % of those without; p<0.01), as well as a lower survival rate (62.8 vs. 87.9 Mo; p<0.01). However, there were no significant differences in the levels of OCT-1 expression in gastric cancer patients with other carcinoma types (p>0.05). Furthermore, we found that the proliferation rate of OCT-1-overexpressing MKN-45 cells was higher than that of the control cells. OCT-1 overexpression may be a marker for poor prognosis in patients with well-differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566898","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Metaplasia","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Oligomer","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Intestinal metaplasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_metaplasia"},{"name":"Missouri","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"}]}
