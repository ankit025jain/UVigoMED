{"id":27822,"title":"Public-private interactions in global food safety governance.","abstract":"In response to an apparent decline in global food safety, numerous public and private regulatory initiatives have emerged to restore public confidence. This trend has been particularly marked by the growing influence of private regulators such as multinational food companies, supermarket chains and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), who employ private standards, certification protocols, third-party auditing, and transnational contracting practices. This paper explores how the structure and processes of private food safety governance interact with traditional public governance regimes, focusing on Global Good Agricultural Practices (GlobalGAP) as a primary example of the former. Due to the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of public regulation in the face of global problems, private governance in food safety has gradually replaced states' command-and-control regulation with more flexible, market-oriented mechanisms. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of constructive regime interaction instead of institutional boundary building to global food safety governance. Public and private ordering must each play a role as integral parts of a larger, dynamic and evolving governance complex.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163209","annotations":[{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Governance","weight":0.596471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Food safety","weight":0.557728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.55473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.518969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.508151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Supermarket","weight":0.458679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.340194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.154744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"International","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.101609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Regime","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Regulatory agency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_agency"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Good Agricultural Practices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Agricultural_Practices"},{"name":"EurepGAP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EurepGAP"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Motion of no confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Private governance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_governance"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Chain store","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_store"}]}
