{"id":72805,"title":"Vismodegib for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma: results and implications of the ERIVANCE BCC trial.","abstract":"The need for effective treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC), in conjunction with major advances in the elucidation of the molecular basis of this tumor has led to the advent of new targeted therapies - namely, hedgehog inhibitors. The rationale for their use in patients with advanced BCC is based on their inhibitory effect on the hedgehog pathway, which is aberrantly activated in BCCs due to mutations of its primary components, PTCH1 and SMO genes. Vismodegib (GDC-0449) is an orally bioavailable hedgehog pathway inhibitor that selectively inhibits SMO. The ERIVANCE BCC study is a Phase II, international, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of vismodegib 150 mg once daily in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC. Vismodegib has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic BCC, or with locally advanced BCC that has recurred following surgery or who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy. This article will outline the rationale, design and available results from the ERIVANCE BCC study and discuss the clinical implications of vismodegib in the management of patients with BCC. Challenges regarding vismodegib use include the recurrence of BCC after drug discontinuation, the development of acquired resistance, the dramatic efficacy in patients with Gorlin syndrome, and class-related drug toxicity. Ongoing clinical trials aim to explore the role of vismodegib in the neoadjuvant setting prior to surgery, the potential use of alternate dosing regimens in order to limit chronic adverse events, as well as the identification of patients with BCC that are more likely to respond to this targeted therapy based on genotypic and/or phenotypic characteristics.
