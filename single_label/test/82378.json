{"id":82378,"title":"The association between poor dental health and depression: findings from a large-scale, population-based study (the NHANES study).","abstract":"To examine the relationship of poor dental health and depression, controlling for markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein; CRP) and adiposity (body mass index; BMI).Data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2005-2008) were utilized (n=10214). Dental health was assessed using the Oral Health Questionnaire (OHQ). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), where cases were identified using a cut off score of 10 or above. Logistic regression was applied to measure magnitude of associations, controlling for a range of covariates including CRP and BMI.After adjustment for covariates, a significant dose-response relationship between number of oral health conditions and likelihood of PHQ-9 defined depression was observed. Compared with individuals without an oral health condition, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for depression in those with two, four and six conditions were 1.60 (1.08-2.38), 2.13 (1.46-3.11) and 3.94 (2.72-5.72), respectively. Level of CRP and being underweight or obese were associated with being depressed.A positive association exists between poor dental health and depression that is independent of CRP and BMI.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636212","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.929702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.699302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.631496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.614106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.470604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.445284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.297445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Patient Health Questionnaire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Health_Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
