{"id":78221,"title":"[Association analysis of IL-23R polymorphisms in allergic rhinitis].","abstract":"Polymorphism of interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) gene was found being related with the susceptibility to several immune-related diseases. For the terminal differentiation of IL-17-producing effecter T-helper cells in vivo, the IL-23R gene is very important. As proved recently, Th17 cells might have a great influence to the pathogenesis of allergic airways disease. Our intention was paid to find any association between the polymorphisms in the IL-23R gene and allergic rhinitis(AR) in Chinese population.A group of patients was involved in a case-control comparison, consisted of 239 AR patients and 271 control Chinese subjects. The study claimed to take some blood samples for DNA extraction and select 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-23R individually genotyped by the PCR-RFLP method.Comparison with the controls, a great growing prevalence of the homozygous rs7517847 GG genotype and G allele appeared in AR patients (P < 0.05, respectively). Besides, a great increased frequency of the GGA haplotypes was presented in AR patients in comparison with the controls (P < 0.05).The results demonstrated a important association pattern between polymorphisms in IL-23R and AR in Chinese population. Between rs7517847 in an SNP of IL-23R and AR, a great association was identified.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738308","annotations":[{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.762575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.756014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.752786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.739303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.528067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Interleukin 23","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_23"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.0111043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"}]}
