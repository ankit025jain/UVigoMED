{"id":83945,"title":"The anatomical origin and course of the angular artery regarding its clinical implications.","abstract":"The purposes of this study were to determine the morphological features and conceptualize the anatomical definition of the angular artery (AA) as an aid to practical operations in the clinical field.Thirty-one hemifaces from 17 Korean cadavers and 26 hemifaces from 13 Thai cadavers were dissected.The topography of the AA was classified into 4 types according to its course: Type I (persistent pattern), in which the AA traverses the lateral side of the nose (11%); Type II (detouring pattern), in which the AA traverses the cheek and tear trough area (18%); Type III (alternative pattern), in which the AA traverses the medial canthal area through a branch of the ophthalmic artery (22.8%); and Type IV (latent pattern), in which the AA is absent (26.3%).The findings of this study will contribute toward improved outcomes for cosmetic surgery involving the injection of facial filler by enhancing the understanding of AA anatomy.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207758","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.55682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.549112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.413393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Cosmetic surgery","weight":0.332043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetic_surgery"},{"name":"Ophthalmic artery","weight":0.252778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmic_artery"},{"name":"Angular artery","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_artery"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.170529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.074308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0531412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Canthus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canthus"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"The Automobile Association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association"},{"name":"Breguet Type III","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breguet_Type_III"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Trough (meteorology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)"}]}
