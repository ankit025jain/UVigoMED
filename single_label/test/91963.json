{"id":91963,"title":"Neuromonitoring changes in pediatric spinal deformity surgery: a single-institution experience.","abstract":"Intraoperative monitoring of the spinal cord has become the standard of care during surgery for pediatric spinal deformity correction. The use of both somatosensory and motor evoked potentials has dramatically increased the sensitivity and specificity of detecting intraoperative neurophysiological changes to the spinal cord, which assists in the intraoperative decision-making process. The authors report on a large, single-center experience with neuromonitoring changes and outline the surgical management of patients who experience significant neuromonitoring changes during spinal deformity correction surgery.The authors conducted a retrospective review of all cases involving pediatric patients who underwent spinal deformity correction surgery at Shriners Hospital for Children, Philadelphia, between January 2007 and March 2010. Five hundred nineteen consecutive cases were reviewed in which neuromonitoring was used, with 47 cases being identified as having significant changes in somatosensory evoked potentials, motor evoked potentials, or both. These cases were reviewed for patient demographic data and surgical characteristics.The incidence of significant neuromonitoring changes was 9.1% (47 of 519 cases), including 6 cases of abnormal Stagnara wake-up tests, of which 4 had corroborated postoperative neurological deficits (8.5% of 47 cases, 0.8% of 519). In response to neuromonitoring changes, wake-up tests were performed in 37 (79%) of 47 cases, hardware was adjusted in 15 (32%), anesthesiology interventions were reported in 5 (11%), hardware was removed in 5 (11%), the patient was successfully repositioned in 3 (6%), and the procedure was aborted in 13 (28%). In 1 of the 4 patients with new postoperative deficits, the deficit had fully resolved by the last follow-up; the other 3 patients had persistent neurological impairment as of the most recent follow-up examination. The authors observed a sensitivity of 100% for intraoperative neuromonitoring.Due to the profound risks associated with spinal deformity surgery, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is an integral tool to warn of impending spinal cord injury. Intraoperative neuromonitoring appears to provide a safe and useful warning mechanism to minimize spinal cord injury that may arise during scoliosis correction surgery in pediatric patients.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and
