{"id":52565,"title":"[Shielding effect of distance in (131)I-131 therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer].","abstract":"To investigate the shielding effect of distance in radioactive iodine treatment in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).Eighty-seven DTC patients underwent postoperative radioactive iodine treatment at the therapeutic doses ranging from 2.96 GBq to 7.4 GBq. The patients were divided into two groups to receive high-dose therapy (?3.7 GBq, 48 patients) and low-dose therapy (<3.7 GBq, 39 patients). The radiation doses at 0.05 m, 1 m, and 3 m were recorded at different days; the doses at 1 m and 3 m on the third day, the dose of standard radioactivity source of 1.11GBq (131)I, and the natural background radioactivity were also recorded.The radiation dose at a 1-meter distance was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group (P<0.05). The radiation doses in different dose groups at the other distances or at different time points showed no significant differences (P>0.05). On the third day after therapy, the radiation dose at 1 m was significantly lower than the reference radioactivity source of 1.11 GBq (131)I (P=0.000), but still higher than the natural background radioactivity at 3 m (P=0.000).In DTC patients who receive radioactive iodine therapy, the radioactive radiation dose decreases rapidly after 3 days. The radioactive radiation dose on the third day is significantly lower than the reference radioactive radiation dose, so that the patients can be discharged with safety for contact at a distance beyond one meter.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589615","annotations":[{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.859443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Becquerel","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Radiation protection","weight":0.45895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.430791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.364585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.265944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Shielding effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shielding_effect"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"},{"name":"Somnambulist (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnambulist_(Angel)"}]}
