{"id":37701,"title":"Total hip arthroplasty with acetabular reconstruction using a bulk autograft for patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip results in high loosening rates at mid-term follow-up.","abstract":"Managing a deficient acetabulum in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) can be challenging. The purpose of the study was to determine the mid-term results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a bulk structural autograft for reconstruction of the acetabular roof in patients with DDH.Between 1982 and 1999, 112 patients underwent THA with acetabular roof-plasty using a bulk structural autograft for secondary osteoarthritis related to DDH. A total of 106 patients (115 hips) met inclusion criteria and were followed for an average of 11.6 years (seven to 24 years). The mean age was 52.5 years at the index operation. Clinical and radiological evaluations were performed according to the methods of Merle d'Aubigné and Postel, Johnston et al. and DeLee and Charnley.The overall Merle d'Aubigné hip score significantly improved (3.7 vs 10.4, p?<?0.01). The limb length discrepancy decreased from 30 to 6 mm (p?<?0.01). The average distance that the hip centre was distalised was 22.3 mm (0-56 mm). However, radiolucent lines were observed in 27 % of patients at final follow-up, and the overall rate of revision for aseptic loosening was 16 %. Further, Kaplan-Meier survivorship curves predicted a rapid increase in the failure rate at 15 years.The mid-term functional outcome of THA with an acetabular roof-plasty using a bulk autograft is satisfactory; however, the long-term results are questionable.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477474","annotations":[{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.467061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.311111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.242048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.162801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Roof","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Concurrent estate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Semi-major axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Postel Abbey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postel_Abbey"},{"name":"Uncial 056","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_056"}]}
