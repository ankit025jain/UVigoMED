{"id":89352,"title":"Biomechanical fatigue analysis of an advanced new carbon fiber/flax/epoxy plate for bone fracture repair using conventional fatigue tests and thermography.","abstract":"The current study is part of an ongoing research program to develop an advanced new carbon fiber/flax/epoxy (CF/flax/epoxy) hybrid composite with a \"sandwich structure\" as a substitute for metallic materials for orthopedic long bone fracture plate applications. The purpose of this study was to assess the fatigue properties of this composite, since cyclic loading is one of the main types of loads carried by a femur fracture plate during normal daily activities. Conventional fatigue testing, thermographic analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the damage progress that occurred during fatigue loading. Fatigue strength obtained using thermography analysis (51% of ultimate tensile strength) was confirmed using the conventional fatigue test (50-55% of ultimate tensile strength). The dynamic modulus (E(?)) was found to stay almost constant at 47GPa versus the number of cycles, which can be related to the contribution of both flax/epoxy and CF/epoxy laminae to the stiffness of the composite. SEM images showed solid bonding at the CF/epoxy and flax/epoxy laminae, with a crack density of only 0.48% for the plate loaded for 2 million cycles. The current composite plate showed much higher fatigue strength than the main loads experienced by a typical patient during cyclic activities; thus, it may be a potential candidate for bone fracture plate applications. Moreover, the fatigue strength from thermographic analysis was the same as that obtained by the conventional fatigue tests, thus demonstrating its potential use as an alternate tool to rapidly evaluate fatigue strength of composite biomaterials.
