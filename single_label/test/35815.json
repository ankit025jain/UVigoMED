{"id":35815,"title":"EKG pattern of Brugada syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome--is it time to review the diagnostic criteria? Case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac disorder characterized by incomplete right bundle-branch block and ST elevations in the anterior precordial leads especially V1 -V3 , associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults. Our case describes a patient with family history of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) who presented with a Brugada pattern unmasked by severe hyperkalemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Several studies have concluded there may be a genetic link among SIDS, SDC, and BrS resulting from mutations in cardiac ion channel-related genes. Recognizing SIDS as part of the diagnostic criteria for BrS would help us identifying a significant number of families susceptible to develop SCD (as well as SIDS).
