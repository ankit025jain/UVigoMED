{"id":84731,"title":"Treatment outcomes of overweight children and parents in the medical home.","abstract":"To test in the primary care setting the short- and long-term efficacy of a behavioral intervention that simultaneously targeted an overweight child and parent versus an information control (IC) targeting weight control only in the child.Two- to 5-year-old children who had BMI ?85th percentile and an overweight parent (BMI >25 kg/m2) were randomized to Intervention or IC, both receiving diet and activity education over 12 months (13 sessions) followed by 12-month follow-up (3 sessions). Parents in the Intervention group were also targeted for weight control and received behavioral intervention. Pediatricians in 4 practices enrolled their patients with the assistance of embedded recruiters (Practice Enhancement Assistants) who assisted with treatment too.A total of 96 of the 105 children randomized (Intervention n = 46; IC n = 50) started the program and had data at baseline. Children in the Intervention experienced greater reductions in percent over BMI (group × months; P = .002) and z-BMI (group × months; P < 0.001) compared with IC throughout treatment and follow-up. Greater BMI reduction was observed over time for parents in the Intervention compared with IC (P < .001) throughout treatment and follow-up. Child weight changes were correlated with parent weight changes at 12 and 24 months (r = 0.38 and 0.26; P < .001 and P = .03).Concurrently targeting preschool-aged overweight and obese youth and their parents in primary care with behavioral intervention results in greater decreases in child percent over BMI, z-BMI, and parent BMI compared with IC. The difference between Intervention and IC persists after 12 months of follow-up.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25049340","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.614275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.520579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.472446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.402574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.351146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.33073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.292918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.053555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Medical home","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_home"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"85th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/85th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dieting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Military recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_recruitment"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"}]}
