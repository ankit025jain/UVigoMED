{"id":70697,"title":"Enhancing central cancer registry treatment data using physician medical claims: a Florida pilot project.","abstract":"To capture the complete first course of therapy and cancer incidence, given the shift in cancer care from the hospital to the private physician practice, central cancer registries (CCRs) in the United States are actively pursuing cancer reporting from ambulatory providers. The 837 medical health claim is a national standard which CCRs can use to capture and translate data into standardized cancer reporting for surveillance.The Florida Cancer Data System conducted a pilot project with a large medical oncology practice to transmit electronic claims from 2011 to 2013. Using the logic and platform developed under a previous National Cancer Institute (NCI) contract, claims were consolidated and translated into standardized cancer registry codes. Consolidated physician claims were compared against gold standard data from the practice electronic health record (EHR) and evaluated for enhancement to registry data.A total of 623 patient tumor cases were collected from the practice EHR and matched to the physician claims data, and to the original cancer registry record. The claims captured 256 cases (41 percent) with chemotherapy, compared to 28 percent in the registry data set, and 45 percent in the gold standard EHR data set. Combining physician claims with registry data produced 280 cases (45 percent) with chemotherapy. The physician claims plus the registry cancer chemotherapy treatment data produced 92 percent agreement, 92 percent sensitivity, and 91 percent positive predictive value. Claims added 103 cases, or 16.5 percent, to the total chemotherapy received.Physician medical claims data capture chemotherapy information not otherwise reported by hospitals, and is a standardized and efficient mechanism for cancer reporting.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153009","annotations":[{"name":"National Cancer Institute","weight":0.873017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.426754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Healthcare science","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_science"},{"name":"Electronic health record","weight":0.366559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.348027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Health claims on food labels","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_claims_on_food_labels"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Logic","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Standard Chinese","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"}]}
