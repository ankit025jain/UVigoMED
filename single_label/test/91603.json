{"id":91603,"title":"Low velocity gunshot wounds result in significant contamination regardless of ballistic characteristics.","abstract":"Controversy exists among the orthopedic community regarding the treatment of gunshot injuries. No consistent treatment algorithm exists for treatment of low energy gunshot wound (GSW) trauma. The purpose of this study was to critically examine the wound contamination following low velocity GSW based upon bullet caliber and clothing fiber type found within the injury track. Four types of handguns were fired at ballistic gel from a 10-foot distance. Various clothing materials were applied (denim, cotton, polyester, and wool) circumferentially around the tissue agar in a loose manor. A total of 32 specimens were examined. Each caliber handgun was fired a minimum of 5 times into a gel. Regardless of bullet caliber there was gross contamination of the entire bullet track in 100% of specimens in all scenarios and for all fiber types. Furthermore, as would be expected, the degree of contamination appeared to increase as the size of the bullet increased. Low velocity GSWs result in significant contamination regardless of bullet caliber and jacket type. Based upon our results further investigation of low velocity GSW tracks is warranted. Further clinical investigation should focus on the degree to which debridement should be undertaken.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490188","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.58421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Bullet","weight":0.543733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet"},{"name":"Cotton","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton"},{"name":"Polyester","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.368387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Wool","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.286311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.275845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Handgun","weight":0.226866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun"},{"name":"Ballistic trauma","weight":0.186417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trauma"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.176092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Ballistics","weight":0.15537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Denim","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Caliber","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliber"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Golden State Warriors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Jacket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacket"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Manorialism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism"},{"name":"Critical thinking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
