{"id":26259,"title":"Detailed analysis of bone marrow from patients with ischemic heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction: BM CD34, CD11b, and clonogenic capacity as biomarkers for clinical outcomes.","abstract":"Bone marrow (BM) cell therapy for ischemic heart disease (IHD) has shown mixed results. Before the full potency of BM cell therapy can be realized, it is essential to understand the BM niche after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).To study the BM composition in patients with IHD and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.BM from 280 patients with IHD and LV dysfunction were analyzed for cell subsets by flow cytometry and colony assays. BM CD34(+) cell percentage was decreased 7 days after AMI (mean of 1.9% versus 2.3%-2.7% in other cohorts; P<0.05). BM-derived endothelial colonies were significantly decreased (P<0.05). Increased BM CD11b(+) cells associated with worse LV ejection fraction (LVEF) after AMI (P<0.05). Increased BM CD34(+) percentage associated with greater improvement in LVEF (+9.9% versus +2.3%; P=0.03, for patients with AMI and +6.6% versus -0.02%; P=0.021 for patients with chronic IHD). In addition, decreased BM CD34(+) percentage in patients with chronic IHD correlated with decrement in LVEF (-2.9% versus +0.7%; P=0.0355).In this study, we show a heterogeneous mixture of BM cell subsets, decreased endothelial colony capacity, a CD34+ cell nadir 7 days after AMI, a negative correlation between CD11b percentage and postinfarct LVEF, and positive correlation of CD34 percentage with change in LVEF after cell therapy. These results serve as a possible basis for the small clinical improvement seen in autologous BM cell therapy trials and support selection of potent cell subsets and reversal of comorbid BM impairment.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25136078","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.915199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.911109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.821198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.762764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.740903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.71301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.655405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.501002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.314495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Integrin alpha M","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin_alpha_M"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0236065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"}]}
