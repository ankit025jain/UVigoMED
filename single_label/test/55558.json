{"id":55558,"title":"Tear film osmolarity in ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate tear film osmolarity in patients with ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP).This observational cross-sectional study included 40 patients with biopsy-proven ocular MMP at Foster stage III referred to the tertiary-care Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Service at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan from June 2010 to August 2013. We evaluated the following clinical parameters: tear film osmolarity, ocular surface disease symptoms (OSDI) questionnaire, Schirmer test, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), and corneal and conjunctival staining.Forty patients (27 women and 13 men) were enrolled. All patients were undergoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy: 19 patients (47.5%) were on methotrexate, 9 (22.5%) were on mycophenolate mofetil, 9 (22.5%) were on low-dose corticosteroids, and 3 (7.5%) were on azathioprine. The mean osmolarity was 322.90 ± 33.39 mOsm/L, the mean OSDI score was 73.2 ± 17.9, the mean TFBUT was 6.60 ± 3.13 seconds, and the mean Schirmer test value was 4.07 ± 3.58 seconds. Tear film osmolarity significantly correlated with the TFBUT (r = 0.80; P < 0.0001), whereas no clinical correlation was found with the Schirmer test value (r = 0.01; P = 0.40) or with the OSDI score (r = 0.02; P = 0.29). Osmolarity did not turn out to be statistically different in the subgroups according to the Oxford corneal staining scale (P = 0.71) and to the Van Bijsterveld conjunctival staining score (P = 0.31).Tear osmolarity increased in patients with ocular MMP and correlated with the TFBUT. This result emphasizes the role of evaporative dry-eye condition in patients with ocular MMP. Tear osmolarity may be considered as a useful test in the diagnostic assessment of dry eye associated with MMP and for targeting therapeutic decisions.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858022","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Azathioprine","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Mycophenolate mofetil","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolate_mofetil"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.610195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Osmolarity","weight":0.546754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmolarity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.453533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.361506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.342427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.14228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Milan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan"},{"name":"Schirmer's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schirmer's_test"},{"name":"Cicatricial pemphigoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicatricial_pemphigoid"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Pemphigoid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigoid"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Evaporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
