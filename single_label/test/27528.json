{"id":27528,"title":"[Perioperative cardiovascular abnormality in elder patients with silent coronary heart disease].","abstract":"To explore the perioperative cardiovascular dysfunction and its relevance to age in patients with silent coronary heart disease (or silent myocardial ischemia), and explore the clinical treatment and recovery of perioperative arrhythmias.One hundred and eighty cases were selected from selective surgery patients with silent myocardial ischemia (SMI). Among the cases, 130 patients older than 51 years old were divided into 51 - 60 year-old group, 61- 70 year-old group and 71 - 80 year-old group. Control group was set up by other 50 patients younger than 51 years old. Electrocardiogram data of 24 h before the operation, 24 h after the operation and 48 h after the operation were continuously monitored by dynamic electrocardiogram (DCG). The electrocardiogram data of ST shifting, arrhythmia incidences of different type and at different time were analyzed by professional doctors. At the same time, the treatment and recovery of perioperative arrhythmia were recorded.As the age increase, the magnitude and duration of ST shifting appeared upward trend compared to the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The incidence of ST elevation in 71 - 80 year-old group was higher than the control group (P < 0.05). The ST depression duration in 61 - 70 and 71 - 80 year-old group and ST elevation magnitude in 71 - 80 year-old group were higher than 51 - 60 year-old group (P < 0.05). Compared to the control group, the incidence of accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIR) in 61 - 70 year-old group and the incidence of sinus bradycardia (SB), ventricular premature beat (VPB), ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 71 - 80 year-old group were higher (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared to the 51 - 60 year-old group, the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 61 - 70 year-old group and the incidence of VP, VT, AF in 71 - 80 year-old group were higher (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The arrhythmia incidences in 24 h after operation were higher than 48 h after operation and 24 h before operation (P < 0.01). As the age increase, the recovery incidence by removing inducement was decreased, but the recovery incidences by drug and electric-shock treatment were increased (P < 0.05).Old SMI patients have high levels of perioperative myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia, and 24 h after operation is the period of high incidence.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Cardiovascular
