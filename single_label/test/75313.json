{"id":75313,"title":"Safety and efficacy of LY2951742, a monoclonal antibody to calcitonin gene-related peptide, for the prevention of migraine: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","abstract":"Migraine remains poorly treated, with few effective preventive drugs available. We assessed the safety and efficacy of LY2951742, a fully humanised monoclonal antibody to calcitonin gene-related peptide, for migraine prevention.Between July 31, 2012, and Sept 18, 2013, 218 patients were randomly assigned to LY2951742 (n=108, but one patient withdrew before treatment) or placebo (n=110). The mean change from baseline to week 12 in the number of migraine headache days was -4·2 (SD 3·1; 62·5% decrease) in the LY2951742 group compared with -3·0 (SD 3·0; 42·3% decrease) in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference -1·2, 90% CI -1·9 to -0·6; p=0·0030). Adverse events that occurred more frequently with LY2951742 than with placebo included injection site pain, erythema, or both (21 [20%] of 107 vs seven [6%] of 110), upper respiratory tract infections (18 [17%] vs ten [9%]), and abdominal pain (six [6%] vs three [3%]). There were two serious adverse events reported in the treatment arm and four in the placebo arm, none of which were deemed to be related to the study drug.These results provide preliminary evidence that LY2951742 might be beneficial in migraine prevention and provide support for the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide in the pathogenesis of migraine. Further controlled studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of monoclonal calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies for the preventive treatment of migraine.Arteaus Therapeutics.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25127173","annotations":[{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Calcitonin","weight":0.788823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.763324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract infection","weight":0.459397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.434199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.291351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.201898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.127237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"}]}
