{"id":85483,"title":"[Impact of six genetic polymorphisms on Warfarin maintenance dose variation in Chinese Han population].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of VKORC1, CYP2C9, GGCX, PROC, EPHX1 and CYP4F2 gene polymorphisms on Warfarin maintenance dose variation in Chinese Han Population.Four hundred eighty-eight patients with prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation or pulmonary thromboembolism and achieved stable Warfarin dose were enrolled. TaqMan probe or direct sequencing were used to genotype Y9VKORC1, CYP2C9, GGCX, EPHX1 and CYP4F2 gene polymorphisms. Demographic characteristics, stable therapeutic dose of Warfarin and concomitant medications were collected for all patients. The effect of VKORC1, CYP2C9, GGCX, PROC, EPHX1 and CYP4F2 gene polymorphisms, demographic characteristics and concomitant medications on Warfarin daily maintenance dose were analyzed with statistical method.VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms could explain more than 50% Warfarin maintenance dose variation in recruited patients, while CYP4F2 gene polymorphisms could only explain 1%. GGCX, PROC and EPHX1 gene polymorphisms had no impact no Warfarin maintenance dose. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms have a greater impact on Warfarin maintenance dose compared with demographic characteristics and concomitant medications.VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms have a significant impact on Warfarin maintenance dose in Chinese Han population.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928022","annotations":[{"name":"Warfarin","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin"},{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.774929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.692442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.608877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"China","weight":0.369763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.360164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.308637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.219376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"People's Republic of China","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"CYP2C9","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C9"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase","weight":0.0421175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-glutamyl_carboxylase"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"4F (military conscription)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4F_(military_conscription)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Ventricular fibrillation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"}]}
