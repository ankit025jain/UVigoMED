{"id":65898,"title":"Congenital primary penile teratoma in a child.","abstract":"Teratomas rarely present as a pediatric congenital primary penile mass. We describe a 14-month-old boy with a blister-like mass on his distal left penis. The subcutaneous mass measured 1.5 cm (length)×1.0 cm (width)×1.2 cm (height) on ultrasonography. There were clear margins between these structures and the lesion. At the age of 5 years, he received an extirpation surgery. Histologic analysis revealed that it was a mature teratoma. In our view, surgical resection should be the treatment of choice for a pediatric penile mass with the alertness of teratomas because of the possibility of malignant alteration and invasion of adjacent structures till unresectable.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767514","annotations":[{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.757301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.623267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.579323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.165316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Embolectomy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolectomy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Alertness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alertness"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
