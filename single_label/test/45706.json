{"id":45706,"title":"A case report of celiac disease; a report done at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa.","abstract":"A 23 year old male patient who was diagnosed to have malabsorption syndrome secondary to celiac disease after he presented with 08 months' duration of chronic diarrhea, significant weight loss and marked body weakness with easy fatigability. Celiac disease is one of the rare causes of malabsorption in African countries. The diagnosis requires appropriate clinical history, high index of suspicion, exclusion of common causes of chronic diarrhea and confirmation by histology after the characteristic endoscopy appearance is identified. Supportive care and gluten restriction was advised and the patient has shown marked improvement in symptoms and general wellbeing. Celiac disease needs to be considered in patients who present with chronic diarrhea that doesn't respond to conventional management.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669678","annotations":[{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Malabsorption","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabsorption"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.499514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.458795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.428827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Gluten","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
