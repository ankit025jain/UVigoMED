{"id":67867,"title":"Physical function and gait speed in patients with chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are treated with dialysis have impaired physical functioning that is associated with poor outcomes. Gait speed is an important measure of mobility that predicts adverse events and mortality in older people. Gait speed is low in patients with CKD, and those treated with hemodialysis average below cut-points known to indicate increased risk of reduced survival and adverse health events. Measurement of gait speed in patients with CKD may be valuable in identifying those at risk for adverse events, including disability and mortality.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579399","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.536645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.51033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.505866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.491924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
