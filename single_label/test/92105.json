{"id":92105,"title":"[Body integrity identity disorder, relief after amputation].","abstract":"Body integrity identity disorder (BIID) is a rare condition in which a person, for no apparent physical reason, is tormented by the experience that a body-part, such as a limb, does not really belong to the body. Patients experience an intense desire for the limb to be amputated (a 'desire' formerly referred to as 'apotemnophilia'). We report on a 58-year-old male patient with BIID who froze one of his legs so that he could amputate it himself. A surgeon ultimately intervened and amputated the leg professionally. The patient was extremely relieved and was still experiencing relief at a follow-up three years later.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446228","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.804589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Body integrity identity disorder","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_identity_disorder"},{"name":"Apotemnophilia","weight":0.196135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotemnophilia"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"}]}
