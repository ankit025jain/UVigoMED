{"id":66011,"title":"Patients' views on a nurse-led prostate clinic.","abstract":"Nurse-led clinics are being established in a number of specialties including urology. Men attending a nurse-led clinic for suspected prostate cancer were surveyed to investigate their perception of and satisfaction with a nurse-led clinic and to establish whether this model of care met expectations. The results showed that patients were satisfied with the service. This adds to the growing body of evidence supporting nurse-led services.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754107","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.260458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.15263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0156195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"}]}
