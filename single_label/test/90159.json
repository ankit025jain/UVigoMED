{"id":90159,"title":"Effects of Aircast brace and elastic bandage on physical performance of athletes after ankle injuries.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using Aircast® orthosis and elastic bandage application on the physical performance of athletes with ankle injuries.The study included 60 elite male football players with ankle injuries. Ankle range of motion on the sagittal and frontal plane was measured. One maximum repetition test for the tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior and peroneal muscles; fingertip rise test, single- and double-feet vertical jump tests and 10-step/sec test for the gastrosoleus were performed. All tests were performed three times; without brace application, wrapped in elastic bandage and fitted with the Aircast® orthosis.There was no statistically significant difference between the test results of single-foot vertical jump, 10-step/sec and fingertip rise tests (p>0.05). Double-feet vertical jump test results with both exterior supports were better than the ankle without any support (p<0.05). Vertical jump test results were significantly higher with the Aircast® orthosis than elastic bandage (p<0.05). Inversion and eversion movements were restricted significantly more in the Aircast® orthosis than in the elastic bandage (p<0.05).Although external supports restrict the foot-ankle range of motion in specific ratios, these restrictions did not adversely affect the athlete's physical fitness. The Aircast® orthosis was more effective than the elastic bandage in reducing injury risk, preventing repetitive injuries and providing an early return to sports.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643094","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.622005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.514089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Triceps surae muscle","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_surae_muscle"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.295072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.247825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Tibialis posterior muscle","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibialis_posterior_muscle"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0967484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Ambling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambling"},{"name":"Vertical jump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_jump"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Tibialis anterior muscle","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibialis_anterior_muscle"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Bandage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage"},{"name":"Frontal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_bone"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Eversion (kinesiology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eversion_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Elastic bandage","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_bandage"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Elite","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"},{"name":"Repetition (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_(music)"},{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"}]}
