{"id":19169,"title":"[Influence of antibiotics on formation of microecology in premature children with low and extremely low body weight at birth].","abstract":"Study the influence of antibiotic therapy on the formation of main biotope microflora nasopharynx, large intestine, urinary system) of the premature child organism weighing less than 500 g at birth in hospital.Bacteriological study of upper respiratory tract discharge, urine, large intestine contents in 58 premature children during admission and discharge from newborn and premature children pathology department was carried out. Factor analysis method was applied to construct factor models of antibiotics influence on main biotope microbiocenosis formation.Deficiency of obligatory normal flora members in all the 3 biotopes was noted in all the children during admission to the department. Colonization of all the biotopes by obligatory members was noted by discharge, however the parameters do not reach age norm. Antibiotics therapy is the main factor, in all the biotopes opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms prevail.The formation of main biotope microbiocenoses does not occur and carriage of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms is noted in premature children receiving massive antibiotic therapy.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738296","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.565244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.563785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.505124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.495584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.481191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.445704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.370166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Human microbiome","weight":0.338329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Nasopharynx","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharynx"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.127237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"}]}
