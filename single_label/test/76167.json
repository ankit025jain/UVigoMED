{"id":76167,"title":"Elevated resting heart rate is associated with dyslipidemia in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.","abstract":"To study the relationship between resting heart rate and blood lipid level.A total of 9 415 subjects aged ? 40 years were included in the present study. Their resting heart rate was monitored and their serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured to define dyslipidemia according to the 2007 Chinese Guidelines on Prevention and Treatment of Dyslipidemia in Adults.The subjects were divided into group A with their resting heart rate <70 beats/min, group B with their resting heart rate =70-79 beats/min, group C with their resting heart rate =80-89 beats/min, and group D with their resting heart rate ? 90 beats/min. High TG, TC, and LDL-C were presented across the resting heart rate (Ptrend <0.01). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk of high TG and TC was higher in subjects with their resting heart rate ? 90 beats/min than in those with their resting heart rate <70 beats/min (OR=1.42; 95% CI: 1.16-1.74 and OR=1.33; 95% CI: 1.09-1.64, respectively).Elevated resting heart rate is associated with high TG and TC in middle-aged and elderly Chinese subjects.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189606","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.688138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.643726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.489409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.28053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.250664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.131703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0998945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"High-Level Data Link Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Military history of China before 1911","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_China_before_1911"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Intel 8089","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8089"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
