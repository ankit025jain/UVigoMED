{"id":21031,"title":"The burden of disease due to tuberculosis in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil.","abstract":"To estimate the burden of disease due to tuberculosis in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 2009.This was an epidemiological study with an ecological design. Data on tuberculosis incidence and mortality were collected from specific Brazilian National Ministry of Health databases. The burden of disease due to tuberculosis was based on the calculation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The DALYs were estimated by adding the years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Absolute values were transformed into rates per 100,000 population. The rates were calculated by gender, age group, and health care macroregion.The burden of disease due to tuberculosis was 5,644.27 DALYs (92.25 DALYs/100,000 population), YLLs and YLDs respectively accounting for 78.77% and 21.23% of that total. The highest rates were found in males in the 30-44 and 45-59 year age brackets, although that was not true in every health care macroregion. Overall, the highest estimated burden was in the Planalto Norte macroregion (179.56 DALYs/100,000 population), followed by the Nordeste macroregion (167.07 DALYs/100,000 population).In the majority of the health care macroregions of Santa Catarina, the burden of disease due to tuberculosis was concentrated in adult males, the level of that concentration varying among the various macroregions.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626271","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.85333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.688839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.678432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.593601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.45775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Disability-adjusted life year","weight":0.224446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Macroregion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroregion"},{"name":"Ecological design","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_design"},{"name":"Santa Catarina (state)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"644","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/644"},{"name":"States of Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Brazil"},{"name":"Bracket (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(architecture)"},{"name":"Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Northeast Region, Brazil","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil"}]}
