{"id":92270,"title":"A review of arthroscopic classification systems for osteochondritis dissecans of the knee.","abstract":"Multiple systems for classifying osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee have been reported. These existing classification systems have some similar characteristics, such as stable lesion/intact articular cartilage and presence of a loose body. However, variations are found in the number of stages and specific lesion characteristics assessed. Currently, no system has been universally accepted. A future classification system should be developed that reconciles the discrepancies among the current systems and provides a clear, consistent, and reliable method for classifying OCD lesions of the knee during arthroscopy.
