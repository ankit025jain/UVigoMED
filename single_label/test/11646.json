{"id":11646,"title":"2013 update on current vaccination strategies in puppies and kittens.","abstract":"Vaccines remain one of the practitioner's greatest tools in preventing disease and maintaining individual and population health. This article is an update to \"Current Vaccination Strategies in Puppies and Kittens\" published in Veterinary Clinics of North America, Small Animal Practitioner, in May 2006. There are now comprehensive guidelines readily available for small animal practitioners regarding canine and feline pediatric (and adult) vaccination recommendations. Perhaps more importantly, there is an increased dialogue regarding all aspects of preventive medicine, of which vaccination is only a small, yet significant portion; and an increased drive to provide scientific evidence for developing vaccination recommendations.
