{"id":78732,"title":"Allergic rhinitis quality of life in urban children with asthma.","abstract":"Urban children with asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) are at risk for experiencing worse AR-related quality of life (QOL). Although AR may be underdiagnosed and undertreated in urban minority children, research has not considered which illness-related indicators (eg, AR control) may contribute to AR QOL in this population.To examine associations among AR control, asthma control, allergy symptoms, asthma symptoms, and AR QOL in a sample of 195 urban caregivers and their children with asthma (7-9 years of age) from African American, Latino, and non-Latino white backgrounds. Racial and ethnic differences in AR QOL were also examined.Families resided in 1 of 4 cities selected as recruitment sources because of their high concentrations of ethnic minority and non-Latino white, urban families. Caregivers and children completed a series of interview-based and clinician-based assessments across one academic year and 4-week periods to track daily asthma and nasal symptoms.Better AR control was associated with higher AR QOL (? = -.32, P < .01) and all QOL subscales. AR control predicted AR QOL over and above asthma control (? = -.28, P < .01). Controlling for AR control, non-Latino white children reported better QOL related to practical problems than both Latino and African American children (P < .05).Findings suggest that strategies to enhance AR control in urban children with asthma may assist in improving AR QOL. Non-Latino white children may experience less impairment of their AR QOL because of practical problems (eg, blow nose) than African American or Latino children with asthma.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589166","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.671231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.638188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.533825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.403242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.341649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.339189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.248197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.227476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"City","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.129649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.121367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Academic term","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
