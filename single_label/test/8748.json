{"id":8748,"title":"Animals with a schizophrenia-like phenotype are differentially sensitive to the motivational effects of cannabinoid agonists in conditioned place preference.","abstract":"Cannabis is the most consumed illicit drug worldwide, but among patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, this consumption is higher suggesting that they are differentially sensitive to cannabis. We chose to study this problematic using a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: neonatal ventral hippocampus lesions (NVHL). In a first study, we compared the locomotor response to novelty, a mild stress and two doses of amphetamine (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) in sham and NVHL rats at post-natal day 35 (PD35) or 56 (PD56). In a second study, we investigated the valence of the motivational effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinnol (THC, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and the cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN55,212-2 (WIN, 1 mg/kg, i.p.), using the conditioned place preference paradigm; we used a biased procedure that comprised 12 days of testing with 3 paired-conditioning. The effects of this dose of WIN were also measured on locomotor activity. Results confirmed that the adult NVHL animals displayed a stronger locomotor response to the two doses of amphetamine, but not to novelty and a mild stress. In adult NVHL, but not sham animals, WIN stimulated locomotor activity and produced a conditioned place aversion. At the dose tested, THC tended to produce an aversion in adult sham but not NVHL animals. Taken together these findings show that adult animals with a schizophrenia-like phenotype are differentially sensitive to the motivational effect of cannabinoids.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755307","annotations":[{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Cannabinoid receptor","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Tetrahydrocannabinol","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.79151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.749649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.679123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.577536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.559904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.404676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.375316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.252345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.158262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.038243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0380153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Cognitive bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Ventral","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"}]}
