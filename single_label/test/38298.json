{"id":38298,"title":"Recent advances in myotonic dystrophy type 2.","abstract":"Myotonic dystrophy is the commonest adult muscular dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) are often discussed jointly, and although they share many clinical and molecular features, differences do exist. Historically, more is known about DM1 than about DM2. The literature in the field of myotonic dystrophy is broad, with advances in our understanding of DM2. This article reviews recent developments in DM2 with respect to diagnosis, systemic features, and molecular mechanisms of the disease.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435591","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.660309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.62712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.437845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Myotonic dystrophy","weight":0.420556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotonic_dystrophy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.379825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.22868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Myotonia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotonia"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
