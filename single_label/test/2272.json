{"id":2272,"title":"A study of free portal pressure in cynomolgus monkeys with different degrees of liver fibrosis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of changes in free portal pressure (FPP) in cynomolgus monkeys with different levels of liver fibrosis and to lay a theoretical foundation for the study of FPP in patients with liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis models were successfully established in 15 of 20 cynomolgus monkeys using carbon tetrachloride, among which 10 monkeys developed severe liver fibrosis (S4; i.e., early cirrhosis). A randomized block design was used to study FPP in the 10 cynomolgus monkeys that developed complete liver fibrosis. The FPP values and the rates of change at different stages of liver fibrosis were analyzed. The normal FPP value of cynomolgus monkeys was 25.56 ± 2.33 mmHg; the FPP value at S1 was 36.05 ± 2.91 mmHg, with an increase of 41.04 ± 3.02%; the value at S2 was 42.79 ± 2.91 mmHg, with an increase of 67.41 ± 2.98%; the value at S3 was 50.27 ± 3.44 mmHg, with an increase of 96.67 ± 5.24%; and the value at S4 was 62.47 ± 3.75 mmHg, with an increase of 144.41 ± 6.34%. FPP and its increase at S4 were significantly higher than the normal value and those at S1, S2, and S3 (P < 0.01). These results showed that FPP increases along with the severity of liver fibrosis. FPP at S4 of severe liver fibrosis were >2-fold higher compared with the normal value.
