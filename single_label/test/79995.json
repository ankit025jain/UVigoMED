{"id":79995,"title":"Evaluation of wondfo rapid diagnostic kit (Pf-HRP2/PAN-pLDH) for diagnosis of malaria by using nano-gold immunochromatographic assay.","abstract":"Prompt and accurate diagnosis is necessary to start adequate treatment for different affecting species including P. falciparum and P. vivax. Here we described the Wondfo Rapid diagnostic Kit (Pf-HRP2/PAN-pLDH) for the detection of P. falciparum and pan-plasmodium in patient specimen by using a nano-gold immunochromatographic assay. Our rapid assay adapted nano-gold labeling techniques and the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against both histidine rich protein-2 (Pf HRP-2) of P. falciparum and pan plasmodium-specific pLDH (pan pLDH). The established two-antibody sandwich immunochromatographic assay could detect P. falciparum and pan-plasmodium. The sensitivity and specificity of Wondfo rapid diagnostic kit were determined by comparing with the \"gold standard\" of microscopic examination of blood smears. In this study1023 blood samples were collected from outpatient clinics in China and Burma, and detected by both Wondfo kit and microscopic examination. The detection sensitivity and specificity of Wondfo rapid diagnostic kit were 96.46% and 99.67% for P. falciparum (HRP2), 95.03% and 99.24% for pLDH, 96.83% and 99.74% for non-falciparum species, 96.70% and 99.74% for P. vivax, respectively. These results indicate that Wondfo rapid diagnostic assay may be useful for detecting P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum (especially P.v.) in patient specimen.
