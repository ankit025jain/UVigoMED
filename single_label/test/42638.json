{"id":42638,"title":"Human papillomavirus DNA load and p16INK4a expression predict for local control in patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy.","abstract":"As the detection rate of HPV-DNA in anal carcinoma commonly exceeds 90%, a comparison between sole HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers with respect to treatment response following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and long-term oncological outcome is challenging. Against this background, we aimed to assess HPV types and HPV DNA load in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) of 95 patients treated with standard CRT for anal cancer to correlate viral load (?/> median) with local failure, distant metastases, cancer-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) rates. Various clinicopathologic parameters and the immunohistochemical marker p16(INK4a) were evaluated for any correlation with HPV16 DNA load and were included in uni- and multivariate analyses. The overall prevalence of HPV DNA was 95.8% with HPV16 monoinfection being the most commonly encountered HPV type (78.9%), followed by HPV16 and 31, 35, 39, 44, 58, 66 and 81 dual infection in 9 patients (9.5%). HPV16 DNA load was significantly associated with p16(INK4a) expression (p = 0.001). Patients with HPV16 DNA load ? median and low p16(INK4a) expression showed significantly worse local control (HPV16 DNA load: univariate p = 0.023, multivariate p = 0.042; p16(INK4a): univariate p = 0.021), and OS (HPV16 DNA load: univariate p = 0.02, multivariate p = 0.03). Moreover, a combined HPV16 DNA load and p16(INK4a) variable revealed a significant correlation to decreased local failure, and increased CSS and OS (p = 0.019, p = 0.04 and p = 0.031). In conclusion, these data indicate that HPV16 DNA load and p16(INK4a) expression are significant prognostic factors for local tumor control and overall survival of patients with anal SCC following CRT.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839133","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Anal cancer","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.763007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.720983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.559736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.369077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.333641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.287938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.268501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"P16 (gene)","weight":0.194746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P16_(gene)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
