{"id":44424,"title":"The performance of enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test for the staging of liver fibrosis: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The enhanced liver fibrosis test (ELF) has been shown to accurately predict significant liver fibrosis in several liver diseases.To perform a meta-analysis to assess the performance of the ELF test for the assessment of liver fibrosis.Electronic and manual searches were performed to identify studies of the ELF test. After methodological quality assessment and data extraction, pooled estimates of the sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristics (sROC) were assessed systematically. The extent of heterogeneity and reasons for it were assessed.Nine studies were identified for analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive LR, negative LR, and DOR values of ELF test, for assessment of significant liver fibrosis, were 83% (95% CI=0.80-0.86), 73% (95% CI=0.69-0.77), 4.00 (95% CI=2.50-6.39), 0.24 (95% CI=0.17-0.34), and 16.10 (95% CI=8.27-31.34), respectively; and, for evaluation of severe liver fibrosis, were 78% (95% CI=0.74-0.81), 76% (95% CI=0.73-0.78), 4.39 (95% CI=2.76-6.97), 0.27 (95% CI=0.16-0.46), and 16.01 (95% CI: 7.15-35.82), respectively; and, for estimation of cirrhosis, were 80% (95% CI=0.75-0.85), 71% (95% CI=0.68-0.74), 3.13 (95% CI=2.01-4.87), 0.29 (95% CI=0.19-0.44), and 14.09 (95% CI: 5.43-36.59), respectively.The ELF test shows good performance and considerable diagnostic value for the prediction of histological fibrosis stage.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736610","annotations":[{"name":"Receiver operating
