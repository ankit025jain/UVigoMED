{"id":66717,"title":"Hormone abnormalities are not related to the erectile dysfunction and decreased libido found in many men with infertility.","abstract":"To evaluate whether hormonal markers predict erectile dysfunction (ED) and symptoms of T deficiency syndrome (TDS), which are commonly found in the population of infertile men.Retrospective study utilizing a prospectively maintained infertility database.A tertiary referral center.A total of 1,750 of 2,783 men presenting for evaluation of infertility between 1995 and 2010 completed validated questionnaires.Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men questionnaires were administered. Baseline risk factors for ED and TDS were also measured. Subjects underwent serum hormone evaluation for total T, calculated bioavailable T, sex hormone-binding globulin, E2, LH, FSH, and PRL.Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine the significance of hormonal markers in predicting ED (Sexual Health Inventory for Men score <22) and/or a positive ADAM score.The prevalence of ED and a positive response to the ADAM questionnaire were 30.5% and 45.2%, respectively, in this population (mean age, 36 years). Low serum T (total T < 10 nmol/L) was found in 29.4%. Neither T nor bioavailable T was significantly associated with the symptoms of ED or TDS on multivariable regression analysis.Erectile dysfunction and TDS in young, infertile men seem to be unrelated to hormone changes.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684954","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile
