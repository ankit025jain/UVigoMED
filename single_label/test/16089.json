{"id":16089,"title":"[The diagnostic of chronic infection Helicobacter pylori in children].","abstract":"The epidemiological studies testify an extremely high prevalence of chronic infection of children with Helicobacter pylori in Russia. The affection consists from 50% to 80% depending on region and age of examined children. The currently in force recommendations \"Maastricht IV\" concerning diagnostic and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection adult patients are applied not in its fullness to children adolescent population. At the same time recently published joint conciliatory document of the European and North American associations of pediatric gastroenterologists is oriented to populations with low prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and particular profile of drug resistance. Hence, an urgent need exists to develop modern local algorithm concerning diagnostic, treatment and control of eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection among children and adolescents in Russia. The review presents analysis of admissibility of application in Russia's conditions of the international conciliatory documents concerning diagnostic of Helicobacter pylori infection in children. The data from conciliatory document of the European (ESPGHAN) and North American (NASPGHAN) associations of pediatric gastroenterologists, particular orginal research studies and one's own clinical experience were used. The advantages and shortcomings of actual methods of laboratory diagnostic of Helicobacter pylori infection are discussed. The approaches to application of particular diagnostic methods are considered. The enhanced indications to detection of infection and implementation of eradication therapy are proposed.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069234","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.613951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.401407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.36771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.310572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.243883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.218614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.211952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.188404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Love","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Testimony","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
