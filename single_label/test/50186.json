{"id":50186,"title":"Alternative treatment modalities for the hypogonadal patient.","abstract":"Testosterone (T) deficiency syndrome (TDS) is a prevalent condition, commonly managed with exogenous T. Despite an abundance of T formulations, alternative treatments are often sought for various reasons. To evaluate outcomes of alternative therapies, a PubMed search was performed of all publications that included men with TDS from 1990 through October 2013, with results summarized. Proposed mechanisms of action were also reviewed to provide a pathophysiologic basis for reported outcomes. Nonpharmacologic therapies that increase endogenous T are weight loss, exercise, and varicocelectomy, while medications used off-label include aromatase inhibitors, human chorionic gonadotropin, and selective estrogen receptor modulators. All reported therapies increase T, while changes in estradiol and adverse events vary by therapeutic class. Although limited data preclude direct comparisons between therapies, exercise and weight loss alone or in combination with medications may be considered first line. The role for surgical therapy in TDS remains undefined and requires further study.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817260","annotations":[{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.839765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.754943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Selective estrogen receptor modulator","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_estrogen_receptor_modulator"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.675816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Growth hormone deficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_deficiency"},{"name":"Oral contraceptive formulations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_contraceptive_formulations"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
