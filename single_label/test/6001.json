{"id":6001,"title":"Effect of vitamin D receptor knockout on cornea epithelium wound healing and tight junctions.","abstract":"Our laboratory previously determined that vitamin D3, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and 1? hydroxylase are present and active in the eye. In this study, we examined the effects of VDR knockout on wound healing, the tight junction-associated proteins occludin and ZO-1, and tight junction numbers in mouse corneas.Epithelial wounds (2-mm) were made with an agar brush on 4-week-old and 10-week-old wild-type, heterozygous, and VDR knockout mouse corneas. Mice were on a normal or high lactose, Ca(2+), and PO?(-) diet. Wound-healing area was measured over time. Real-time PCR was used to quantify occludin and ZO-1 message expression. Western blot was used for protein expression. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine corneal epithelium and endothelium tight junctions. Immunofluorescence was used to examine epithelial ZO-1 distribution.Results showed a decreased healing rate in 10-week-old VDR knockout mice compared with wild-types. Vitamin D receptor knockout mice on the special diet had no difference in healing rate compared with wild-types. Real-time PCR showed decreased expression of occludin and ZO-1 in 10-week-old VDR knockout mice compared with wild-types. Western blot of 10-week-old knockout mouse corneas showed decreased occludin expression compared with wild-types. Transmission electron microscopy showed a significant difference in tight junction numbers in VDR knockouts versus wild-types. Immunofluorescence showed a change in ZO-1 distribution among genotypes.Vitamin D receptor knockout affects mouse corneal epithelium wound healing and tight junction integrity.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25061117","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.912664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Tight junction","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.814682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lactose","weight":0.804801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose"},{"name":"Calcitriol receptor","weight":0.803216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol_receptor"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.798102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.760308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.623819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.532844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.520565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.321274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.219212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.195016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.0880793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Occludin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occludin"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Gap junction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
