{"id":66705,"title":"THADA gene polymorphism and prostate cancer risk: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1465618 in THADA at 2p21 has been identified as being associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk in Europeans; however, it is not clear whether the SNP is related to PCa risk in multiple populations. We investigated the association of rs1465618 in THADA with PCa in a Chinese population and carried out a meta-analysis in multiple populations, testing the relevance of this SNP for PCa risk.We genotyped the SNP using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis and assessed its association with PCa risk in a case-control study of 289 PCa patients and 288 controls in a Chinese population. A meta-analysis was carried out with 36,313 PCa patients and 36,485 controls to evaluate the association of rs1465618 with PCa risk in multiple populations.rs1465618 in THADA was significantly associated with PCa risk (p = 0.026; odds ratio (OR) 1.327, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.035-1.700). Furthermore, the rs1465618 variant genotype was associated with PCa aggressiveness (p = 0.044; OR = 2.053, 95% CI = 1.015-6.602) in the Chinese population. The meta-analysis showed that rs1465618 was significantly associated with PCa risk in multiple populations (p = 1.0Ã—10(-8); OR = 1.127, 95% CI = 1.085-1.171).Our results showed that rs1465618 in THADA may be a shared susceptibility variant for PCa in multiple populations. THADA gene polymorphisms may impact PCa susceptibility and progression.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685913","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.809027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.605577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"SNP genotyping","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP_genotyping"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.257566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"China","weight":0.1621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0269276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"602","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/602"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"}]}
