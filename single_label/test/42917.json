{"id":42917,"title":"ABT-450, ritonavir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir achieves 97% and 100% sustained virologic response with or without ribavirin in treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1b infection.","abstract":"The interferon-free regimen of ABT-450 (a protease inhibitor), ritonavir, ombitasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), dasabuvir (a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor), and ribavirin has shown efficacy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection-the most prevalent subgenotype worldwide. We evaluated whether ribavirin is necessary for ABT-450, ritonavir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir to produce high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) in these patients.We performed a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial of 179 patients with HCV genotype 1b infection, without cirrhosis, previously treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to groups given ABT-450, ritonavir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir, with ribavirin (group 1) or without (group 2) for 12 weeks. The primary end point was SVR 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). We assessed the noninferiority of this regimen to the rate of response reported (64%) for a similar population treated with telaprevir, peginterferon, and ribavirin.Groups 1 and 2 each had high rates of SVR12, which were noninferior to the reported rate of response to the combination of telaprevir, peginterferon, and ribavirin (group 1: 96.6%; 95% confidence interval, 92.8%-100%; and group 2: 100%; 95% confidence interval, 95.9%-100%). The rate of response in group 2 was noninferior to that of group 1. No virologic failure occurred during the study. Two patients (1.1%) discontinued the study owing to adverse events, both in group 1. The most common adverse events in groups 1 and 2 were fatigue (31.9% vs 15.8%) and headache (24.2% vs 23.2%), respectively. Decreases in hemoglobin level to less than the lower limit of normal were more frequent in group 1 (42.0% vs 5.5% in group 2; P < .001), although only 2 patients had hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818763","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.912129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Ritonavir","weight":0.897172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.728068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.700094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.641585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.574772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.343527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.260134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Rate of response","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_response"},{"name":"Phase III trial","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_III_trial"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"American Ballet Theatre","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ballet_Theatre"},{"name":"No. 1 Group RAF","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._1_Group_RAF"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 8100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8100"}]}
