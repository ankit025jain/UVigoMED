{"id":82720,"title":"Mothers' taste perceptions and their preschool children's dental caries experiences.","abstract":"This study's purpose was to determine the caries experiences of preschool children whose mothers exhibited various genetic taste sensitivities to sweet foods, as reflected by their ability to taste the chemical 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP).A convenience sample of 38 healthy two- to three-year-old preschool children and their mothers was selected. Data regarding maternal demographics and children's oral hygiene practices were obtained by questionnaires. Children received oral clinical examinations. Mothers received a PROP test to determine their taste type.Twenty mothers were PROP supertasters (disliking sweet food), and 18 mothers were PROP nontasters (liking sweet food). Children of nontaster mothers were found to have a greater prevalence of dental caries and a greater number of decayed, missing, and filled surfaces (dmfs) of maxillary anterior teeth than those of supertaster mothers (P<.05). Children of nontaster mothers whose grandparents reportedly lived in the same household had increased dmfs vs. those without grandparents in the household (P<.05).The prevalence of dental caries in two- to three-year-old-children was significantly greater in children of mothers who couldn't taste the chemical 6-n-propylthiouracil than those of mothers who could. A mother's PROP type could be an important variable related to the caries experience of preschool children.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553273","annotations":[{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.930462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.680583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.120837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0870413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sweetness","weight":0.0380153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Supertaster","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"PRO (category theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRO_(category_theory)"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"}]}
