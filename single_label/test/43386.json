{"id":43386,"title":"Failing to reverse a diverting stoma after lower anterior resection of rectal cancer.","abstract":"A diverting stoma is an accepted adjunct to low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer. However, some patients do not undergo a subsequent procedure to have the stoma reversed. We aim to determine incidence and risk factors for nonclosure of the diverting stoma.This is a retrospective study of stage I to III rectal cancer patients at a single institution having LAR with curative intent and a diverting stoma.We studied 162 patients. Prevalence of nonclosure of the temporary stoma was 14.5% within 13Â months of the index surgery. On a multivariate linear regression model, nonclosure was associated with anastomotic leak (odds ratio 9.89, 2.31 to 43.93, P < .001) and age older than 65 (odds ratio 2.76, 1.08 to 7.48, P < .036).Prevalence of nonclosure of a diverting stoma after LAR for rectal cancer is substantial (14.5%). Patients should be counselled regarding this risk with particular attention to potential risk factors.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791631","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.766946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.739153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.736716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.359732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Laredo Heat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo_Heat"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"}]}
