{"id":88482,"title":"[Oxygen therapy in wound treatment].","abstract":"The observation of a device delivering oxygen locally on twelve patients with chronic wounds for which conventional treatments have had little or no effect, aims to assess the benefit of the local use of oxygen on complex wounds. The main benefits observed are the obtaining of high quality tissue formation and a notable reduction in pain. These encouraging initial results merit being backed up by a comparative clinical study.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839677","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.540531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.526043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chronic wound","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wound"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
