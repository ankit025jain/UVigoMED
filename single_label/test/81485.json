{"id":81485,"title":"Polish public programme of dental caries prevention in children aged 6, 12 and 18 years in 2012.","abstract":"Studies conducted within the framework of \"Monitoring of oral health in Polish population\", adapted by Ministry of Health, determined the percentage of children aged up to 18 years who were involved in prophylactic programme in schools.The study aimed at analyzing the prophylactic programme conducted in 2012 in Poland, combined with the procedure of sealing of primary and permanent lateral teeth in 3 age groups.A total of 5,723 children aged 6, 12 and 18 years living in 7 voivodeships were involved in epidemiological study. The study was conducted pursuant to WHO recommendations (Oral Health Surveys).The percentage of children in particular age groups involved in prophylactic programme was: 34.8% and 97.3%, while the 18-year-olds were not subject to prophylaxis. Taking into account the completion status of prophylactic programmes, considerable differences between voivodeships were observed. A minor percentage of children aged 6 years had primary and permanent teeth sealed with their respective share being 0.6% and 7.1%. The percentage of children aged 12 years with sealed teeth amounted to 33%. The noticed disprities in the percentage of sealed teeth in particular voivodeships ranged from 1.4 to 56.0%. Less than 1% (0.8%) of examined 18-year-olds required sealing of teeth as generally lateral teeth in this age were filled or affected by dental caries.1. Having analyzed the place of residence (urban, rural area) in relation to the number of children involved in prophylactic programme, no differences were observed in children aged 6 years. However, considerable disparities were present between particular voivodeships. A minor percentage of 6-year-olds had sealed permanent teeth, its value was less regarding primary teeth. 2. Nearly all children aged 12 years were subject to fluoride prophylactic programme, while in four voivodeships it amounted to 100%. The percentage of sealed teeth was 33%. From the analysis of number of sealed teeth in examined children transpires that more than 67% of children had no sealing of teeth, while 13% of them had from 4 to 6 teeth with sealants.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004631","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.756543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.632539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.629258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.57225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.286952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.273912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.236608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.205489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Poles","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Voivodeships of Poland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivodeships_of_Poland"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"723","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/723"},{"name":"Seal (emblem)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Pinniped","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Wiktionary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Dental sealant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_sealant"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Department of Health (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"A minor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_minor"}]}
