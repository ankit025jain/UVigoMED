{"id":8632,"title":"[Pharmacological study on hemostasis, analgesic and anti inflammation effects of the alcohol extract of Hibiscus tiliaceus].","abstract":"To study the effects of hemostasis, analgesic and anti inflammation of the alcohol extract of Hibiscus tiliaceus and offer pharmacological and experimental basis for its safe and effective use in clinic.The effects of hemostasist were observed with tail breaking method, capillary tube method and slide method; Hot board and body distortion induced by acetic acid methods were applied in mice analgesia experiment, the mice model of acute auricle swelling induced by dmi ethylbenzene and capillary permeability induced by acetic acid were applied to observe the anti inflammatory effects.The alcohol extract of Hibiscus tiliaceus could significantly reduce the bleeding time and the clotting time, delay the plant reaction time and reduce the writhing times of the mice, and it also had effect on inhibiting swelling of mice ear and the permeability of the capillary.These results suggest that the alcohol extract of Hibiscus tiliaceus has the effects of hemostasis, analgesic and anti inflammation.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761677","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.363121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.268352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.204312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Vascular permeability","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_permeability"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.188249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"Ethylbenzene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylbenzene"},{"name":"Capillary action","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Hibiscus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibiscus"},{"name":"Mental chronometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_chronometry"}]}
