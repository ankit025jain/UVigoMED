{"id":86978,"title":"[Genome amplification and sequence analysis of human bocavirus 2].","abstract":"To obtain the genome sequence of human bocavirus 2 (HBoV2), different regions of HBoV2 genome were amplified through PCR in fecal specimens which had been identified as single-positive for HBoV2 in 2010. A genome sequence of HBoV2 (HBoV2-NC, 5444 bp) was obtained after sequence assembly. The phylogenetic analysis showed that HBoV2-NC had the closest evolutionary relationship with HBoV2 Lanzhou strain. The predication of inverted terminal repeats of HBoV2-NC by DINAMelt showed that inverted terminal repeats were contained in HBoV2-NC 5' terminal, which had the typical stem-loop structure in other parvoviruses. Finally, some flanking sequences of HBoV2-NC were amplified by linker-PCR.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118380","annotations":[{"name":"Sequence assembly","weight":0.865113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.710663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.538047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.328847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.296664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.246903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.205488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Lanzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzhou"},{"name":"Structure of policy debate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_policy_debate"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"Inverted repeat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_repeat"},{"name":"Vidhan Sabha","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidhan_Sabha"},{"name":"Flanking maneuver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanking_maneuver"},{"name":"Predicate (grammar)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar)"}]}
