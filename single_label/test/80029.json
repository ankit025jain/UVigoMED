{"id":80029,"title":"[Surveilance and response for Schistosomiasis japonica based on sentinel mice examination for cercariae-infested water in risk region, 2012].","abstract":"To monitor water body infestation in schistosomiasis high-risk areas with sentinel mouse technique.A total of 72 surveillance sites from 47 counties were selected in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Sichuan. The water infectivity of Schistosoma japonicum was determined in the surveillance sites by using sentinel mice during June-July and September, 2012.Among the 3,283 sentinel mice which were placed in 72 sites, 3,062 (93.3%) were recovered and dissected. Infected sentinel mice were found in six sites accounting for 8.3% (6/72) of the total surveillance sites, with an occurrence rate of sites with infected mice of 8.3% in June-July and 2.8% in September. 33 infected mice were discovered with a total infection rate of 1.08% (33/3,062). 1,085 adult worms were collected, with a mean worm burden of 32.9 worms per mouse in infected sentinel mice. 4 positive sites were in Hunan and 2 were in Jiangxi. Local acute schistosomiasis or suspected local acute cases which detected elsewhere were reported in 2 positive sites. Some follow-up activities were conducted in the 6 positive sites.Compared with those in 2010, the schistosomiasis risk areas are shrinking in 2012. However, some regions are still the schistosomiasis high-risk areas.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818406","annotations":[{"name":"Anhui","weight":0.755324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.664835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.522041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Yunnan","weight":0.467996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"},{"name":"Sichuan","weight":0.450145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.39789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.331285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Hunan","weight":0.295556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Jiangxi","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi"},{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.140833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.027714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"672","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/672"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"283","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/283"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Loquat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loquat"},{"name":"Cradle of civilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization"},{"name":"Body of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water"},{"name":"Watchtower","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchtower"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Uncial 085","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_085"},{"name":"Infestation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation"},{"name":"Counties of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"}]}
