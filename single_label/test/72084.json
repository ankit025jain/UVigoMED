{"id":72084,"title":"Xenon decreases cell migration and secretion of a pro-angiogenesis factor in breast adenocarcinoma cells: comparison with sevoflurane.","abstract":"While volatile agents have been implicated in metastasis-enhancing effects on cancer cells, the effects of xenon are unknown. We investigated xenon- and sevoflurane-mediated effects on migration and expression of angiogenesis biomarkers in human breast adenocarcinoma cells.MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were exposed to xenon 70% with O2 25%, CO2 5%; control gas containing O2 25%, CO2 5%, N2 70%; or sevoflurane 2.5 vol% administered in O2 60%, N2 37%, or control gas. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Migration at 24 h was determined using the Orisâ„¢ Cell Migration Assay. Secretion of angiogenesis factors was measured using a membrane-based immunoassay array.Xenon reduced MDA-MB-231 migration to 59 (13%) after 1-h exposure (P=0.02), 64 (10%) after 3 h (P=0.01), and 71 (9%) after 5 h (P=0.04) compared with control gas, without affecting viability. Similarly, MCF-7 migration was significantly reduced at all timepoints [to 58 (12%) at 1 h, 65 (12%) at 3 h, and 65% (12%) at 5 h]. Sevoflurane did not affect migration when delivered in control gas. Glycine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor co-agonist, antagonized the effects of xenon on migration. Expression of the pro-angiogenesis factor regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) was reduced in conditioned medium from xenon-exposed MDA-MB-231 cells compared with cells exposed to either control gas or sevoflurane [mean dot density 2.0 (0.2) compared with 3.0 (0.1) and 3.1 (0.3), respectively (P=0.02)].Xenon, but not sevoflurane, inhibited migration in both oestrogen receptor positive and negative breast adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, xenon decreased release of the pro-angiogenic factor RANTES from MDA-MB-231 cells.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25001620","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.786694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.774684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.774299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Glycine","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.636845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Xenon","weight":0.634476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.533539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.485512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"CCL5","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL5"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Volatility (chemistry)","weight":0.412081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.355833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.307319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.230445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0320572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Isotopes of xenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_xenon"}]}
