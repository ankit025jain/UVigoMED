{"id":80684,"title":"Polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for the differentiation of Trichinella nativa and Trichinella britovi.","abstract":"Recently, Trichinella nativa was identified in foxes in Germany and Poland, indicating that the geographical distribution of T. nativa is not restricted to areas north of the isotherm -4Â°C in January. In the European Union, legislation requires that a regular monitoring of the occurrence of Trichinella spp. in indicator animals such as foxes or raccoon dogs be carried out. The Trichinella isolates must also be identified on a species level. The multiplex PCR recommended by the Community Reference Laboratory for Trichinella allows species identification, yet the differentiation of T. nativa and Trichinella britovi, a widespread Trichinella species in the temperate regions of Europe, is unstable. We therefore describe an easy and reliable method for the differentiation of the two species, which can be utilised to monitor a potential spread of T. nativa in Central Europe.
