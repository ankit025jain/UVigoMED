{"id":62994,"title":"Vitreoretinal lymphoma versus uveitis: cytokine profile and correlations.","abstract":"To compare the cytokine spectrum of vitreoretinal lymphoma to uveitis and correlate cytokine concentrations with disease activity.Retrospective case series of 10 patients with vitreoretinal lymphoma and 7 patients with uveitis. Aqueous humor concentration of IFN-?, TNF-?, TNF-?, IL-1ra, IL-1?, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and VEGF-A was determined using a bead-based assay (Luminex). Variance between groups, correlation coefficients, and longitudinal behavior of cytokines were analyzed.No statistically significant difference in cytokines was found when comparing groups. IL-10 was positively correlated with IL-6 and MCP-1. IL-6 was positively correlated with G-CSF, IL-1ra, IL-8, and IL-10. A relationship between concentration of any cytokine, aside from IL-10, and disease activity was not found.IL-10 and IL-6 are good immunologic markers to be used as complementary diagnostic tools. IL-10 is the only IL that could be used for monitoring purposes.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490677","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.867667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.867667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.857892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.802861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.798363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.775615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.744551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.479459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.16588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"}]}
