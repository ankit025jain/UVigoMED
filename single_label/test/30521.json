{"id":30521,"title":"Time-dependent effects of prazosin on the development of methamphetamine conditioned hyperactivity and context-specific sensitization in mice.","abstract":"The present experiments examined the effects of prazosin, a selective ??-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on the development of methamphetamine conditioned hyperactivity and context-specific sensitization. Mice received an injection of vehicle (distilled water) or prazosin (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg) 30 min prior to a second injection of vehicle (saline) or methamphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) during the conditioning sessions (Experiment 1). Following the conditioning sessions, mice were tested for conditioned hyperactivity and then tested for context-specific sensitization. In subsequent experiments, mice received an injection of vehicle (distilled water) or prazosin (2.0 mg/kg) immediately (Experiment 2) or 24 h (Experiment 3) after the conditioning sessions and then tested for conditioned hyperactivity and context-specific sensitization. Prazosin dose-dependently blocked the development of methamphetamine conditioned hyperactivity and context-specific sensitization when administered prior to the methamphetamine during the conditioning phase; however nonspecific motor impairments also were observed (Experiment 1). Immediate (Experiment 2), but not the 24-h delay (Experiment 3), post-session administration of prazosin attenuated the development of methamphetamine conditioned hyperactivity and context-specific sensitization. Nonspecific motor impairments were not observed in these latter experiments. Collectively, these results suggest that the ??-adrenergic receptor mediates the development of methamphetamine-conditioned hyperactivity and context-specific sensitization, perhaps by altering memory consolidation and/or reconsolidation processes.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487011","annotations":[{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.691835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.489409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.330791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0809308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Prazosin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prazosin"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Memory consolidation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
