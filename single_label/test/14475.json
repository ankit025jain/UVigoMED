{"id":14475,"title":"Molecular characterization and expression analysis of a peroxiredoxin 1 cDNA from Korean rose bitterling (Rhodeus uyekii).","abstract":"Peroxiredoxins (Prxs), also known as natural killer cell enhancing factors in fish, role as antioxidant proteins and participate in a variety of biological processes, including H2O2-mediated cell signaling, molecular chaperoning, and mitochondrial function. In this study, we isolated and characterized a Prx 1 cDNA from the Korean rose bitterling Rhodeus uyekii, and designated it RuPrx 1. The RuPrx 1 cDNA encodes a 197-amino-acid polypeptide that belongs to the class of typical 2-Cys Prxs that contain peroxidatic and resolving cysteines. The deduced RuPrx 1 protein shows strong homology (77.38-92.89 %) with Prx 1 proteins from other species, including fish, amphibians, and mammals, and it is most closely related to rainbow smelt Prx 1. RuPrx 1 mRNA was ubiquitously detected in all tested tissues and its expression was comparatively high in the brain, intestine, kidney, liver, ovary, stomach, and testis. Expression of RuPrx 1 mRNA in liver peaked 3 h post-infection with Aeromonas hydrophila and decreased 24 h post-infection while the expression in intestine decreased 24 h post-infection. These results suggest that RuPrx 1 is conserved through evolution and may play roles similar to its mammalian counterparts.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420863","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.85772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.808835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Amphibian","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.713597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.636845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.554997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"},{"name":"Smelting","weight":0.131055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting"},{"name":"Peroxiredoxin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxiredoxin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Korean cuisine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_cuisine"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Rainbow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
