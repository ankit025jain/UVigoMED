{"id":66395,"title":"Asparagus racemosus leaf extract inhibits growth of UOK 146 renal cell carcinoma cell line: simultaneous oncogenic PRCCTFE3 fusion transcript inhibition and apoptosis independent cell death.","abstract":"To evaluate anti-cancer activity of Asparagus racemosus (AR) leaf extract on UOK146, a renal cell carcinoma cell line, and explore its mechanism of action.Dried AR leaves were extracted with chloroform and dissolved in DMSO. This extract was applied to UOK146 and cell death was estimated by MTT assay. In addition PRCC-TFE3 fusion transcripts were detected by real time PCR.Extract was found to be cytotoxic with an IC50 of 0.9 mg/ml as estimated by dose response curve. Antitumor activity of the permissible doses of the extract was assessed by the down regulation of PRCC-TFE3 fusion transcript (38%) responsible for oncogenicity of the UOK146 cell line. No increment in the BAX, a proapoptotic marker level was observed.Evidence of antiproliferative effect, PRCC-TFE3 fusion transcript inhibition and static BAX level clearly indicate that AR extract provides or elicits an apoptosis independent anticancer effect on RCC cells by some specific mechanism of regulation.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716915","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.826868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Dimethyl sulfoxide","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.683517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.655767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Dose-response relationship","weight":0.551409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose-response_relationship"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.508237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Asparagus","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagus"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"Electrostatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"}]}
