{"id":13653,"title":"The dual PPAR?/? agonist aleglitazar increases the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells: implications for vascular function and atherogenesis.","abstract":"Aleglitazar is a dual PPAR?/? agonist but little is known about its effects on vascular function and atherogenesis. Hence, we characterized its effects on circulating angiogenic cells (CAC), neoangiogenesis, endothelial function, arteriogenesis and atherosclerosis in mice.C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT, normal chow), endothelial NOS (eNOS)(-/-) (normal chow) and ApoE(-/-) (Western-type diet) mice were treated with aleglitazar (10?mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1) , i.p.) or vehicle.Aleglitazar enhanced expression of PPAR? and PPAR? target genes, normalized glucose tolerance and potently reduced hepatic fat in ApoE(-/-) mice. In WT mice, but not in eNOS(-/-) , aleglitazar up-regulated Sca-1/VEGFR2-positive CAC in the blood and bone marrow and up-regulated diLDL/lectin-positive CAC. Aleglitazar augmented CAC migration and enhanced neoangiogenesis. In ApoE(-/-) mice, aleglitazar up-regulated CAC number and function, reduced markers of vascular inflammation and potently improved perfusion restoration after hindlimb ischaemia and aortic endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. This was associated with markedly reduced formation of atherosclerotic plaques. In human cultured CAC from healthy donors and patients with coronary artery disease with or without diabetes mellitus, aleglitazar increased migration and colony-forming units in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced CAC apoptosis and expression of p53 were reduced, while telomerase activity and expression of phospho-eNOS and phospho-Akt were elevated. Comparative agonist and inhibitor experiments revealed that aleglitazar's effects on CAC migration and colony-forming units were mediated by both PPAR? and PPAR? signalling and required Akt.Aleglitazar augments the number, function and survival of CAC, which correlates with improved vascular function, enhanced arteriogenesis and prevention of atherosclerosis in mice.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Animal
