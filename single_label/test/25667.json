{"id":25667,"title":"Serum fetuin-A levels in patients with systolic heart failure.","abstract":"Inflammation and dystrophic calcification have been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential usefulness of fetuin-A as a biomarker in CHF.Serum fetuin-A was measured in 66 CHF patients with left ventricular function < 50% and in 31 healthy controls at baseline. Fetuin-A was evaluated as a diagnostic marker for systolic heart failure and compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP).The levels of serum fetuin-A were significantly decreased in the CHF patients compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Although there were significant correlations between fetuin-A and certain parameters in patients and controls, none of these were present consistently in either group. It was found that serum fetuin-A levels could identify patients with systolic heart failure with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.Serum fetuin-A is decreased in CHF patients, indicating that anti-inflammatory activity is downregulated in CHF and that calcification may be associated with CHF.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181915","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.881767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.810495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.324044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dystrophic calcification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophic_calcification"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"}]}
