{"id":75622,"title":"[The effect of normal and pathological aging on cognition].","abstract":"Cognitive deficits in the executive and memory domains are observed in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These deficits are associated with changes at the brain activity level. However, a series of factors are prone to delay the occurrence of cognitive deficits, such as mental stimulation or physical activity. Similarly, cognitive rehabilitation allows improving the daily life functioning of patients with AD. The identification of factors and techniques that contribute to maintain cognitive efficiency and/or counteract the effects of AD will allow optimizing quality of life of older people.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065230","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cognitive deficit","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
