{"id":56257,"title":"[Issues in psychiatric evaluation of children and adolescents with visual impairment].","abstract":"Approximately 8% from those who are defined as blind in Israel are children and adolescents. Visual impairment is correlated with a high rate of psychopathology. However, some of these children and adolescents do not receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Often, the clinicians and those who treat the children/adolescents lack the proper professional knowledge related to the unique diagnosis and treatment of children/ adolescents who are visually impaired. Visual impairment might influence different aspects of the psychiatric diagnosis. These aspects include the influence of the impairment on different developmental axes; the reciprocal relationship between the child and his/her environment; the clinical presentation of different psychopathologies; and the different treatment modalities. In this review we discuss these issues. Moreover, we raise the question as to whether there is a need to adapt the psychiatric evaluation and the treatment specifically to the visually impaired child. The review is based on the existing literature in addition to our clinical experience, which stems from our work with children and adolescents who are at the \"Jewish Institute for the Blind\", an institute for children and adolescents with visual impairment in Israel.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716430","annotations":[{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.688108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.628653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.581648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.579496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Judaism","weight":0.480834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.335029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.274307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Visual arts","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Issues (Korn album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_(Korn_album)"},{"name":"Institute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Pole and polar","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_and_polar"}]}
