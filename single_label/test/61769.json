{"id":61769,"title":"A phase II study of dose-dense and dose-intense ABVD (ABVDDD-DI ) without consolidation radiotherapy in patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"We explored activity and safety of a dose-dense/dose-intense adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine regimen (ABVDDD-DI ) in 82 patients with advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma. Patients entered a two-stage Bryant-Day Phase II study to receive six cycles of ABVDDD-DI without consolidation radiotherapy. Cycles were supported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and delivered every 21 d; drugs were administered on days 1 and 11 at the same doses of standard ABVD except for doxorubicin (35 mg/m2; first four cycles only). Co-primary endpoints were complete response (CR) rate and severe acute cardiopulmonary toxicity; secondary endpoints were event-free (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS). All patients received the four doxorubicin-intensified courses and 96% concluded all six cycles (82.3% within the intended 18 weeks). This translated into a 66.9% increase of received dose-intensity for doxorubicin and 31.8% for the other agents over standard ABVD. The CR rate was 95.1% (78/82) and 87.8% (72/82) achieved a metabolic CR after two cycles. Cardiopulmonary toxicity never exceeded grade 2 and affected 14.6% of patients. Most frequent toxicities were grade 4 neutropenia (10%) and anaemia (9%), grade 3 infection (17%) and grade 2 mucocutaneous changes (30%). Five-year EFS and DFS was 88.3% and 93.7%, respectively. ABVDDD-DI regimen was well-tolerated and ensured substantial CR and EFS rates without radiotherapy.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673727","annotations":[{"name":"Vinblastine","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinblastine"},{"name":"Bleomycin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleomycin"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Dacarbazine","weight":0.849187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacarbazine"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.44725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.410356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"ABVD","weight":0.286689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"}]}
