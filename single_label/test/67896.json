{"id":67896,"title":"The basic domain of HIV-tat transactivating protein is essential for its targeting to lipid rafts and regulating fibroblast growth factor-2 signaling in podocytes isolated from children with HIV-1-associated nephropathy.","abstract":"Podocyte injury has a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). The HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat), combined with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), can induce the dedifferentiation and proliferation of cultured human podocytes. Cellular internalization of Tat requires interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts (LRs). However, the specific distribution of Tat in human podocytes and its ability to associate with LRs have not been documented. Here, we found that Tat is preferentially recruited to LRs in podocytes isolated from children with HIVAN. Furthermore, we identified arginines in the basic domain (RKKRRQRRR) of Tat as essential for (1) targeting Tat to LRs, (2) Tat-mediated increases in the expression of Rho-A and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in LRs, and (3) Tat-mediated enhancement of FGF-2 signaling in human podocytes and HIV-transgenic mouse kidneys and the exacerbation of renal lesions in these mice. Tat carrying alanine substitutions in the basic domain (AKKAAQAAA) remained localized in the cytosol and did not associate with LRs or enhance FGF-2 signaling in cultured podocytes. These results show the specific association of Tat with LRs in podocytes isolated from children with HIVAN, confirm Tat as a regulator of FGF-2 signaling in LRs, and identify the key domain of Tat responsible for promoting these effects and aggravating renal injury in HIV-transgenic mice. Moreover, these results provide a molecular framework for developing novel therapies to improve the clinical outcome of children with HIVAN.
