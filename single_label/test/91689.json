{"id":91689,"title":"[Magnet intestinal lesions. Case series].","abstract":"The ingestion of foreign bodies is a common trouble in the pediatric population, and most of cases occur between 6 months and 3 years. In general the vast majority of foreign bodies are not associated with morbidity or mortality. Ingestion of two or more magnets can lead to obstruction, fistulas, ulceration, perforation and bowel volvulus. In this series we present 4 cases of patients ingesting multiple magnets and who due to the ingested foreign body characteristics and clinical profile required surgical treatment.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482909","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.850057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.724895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.69265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.644821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Volvulus","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvulus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Magnet","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
