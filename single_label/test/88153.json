{"id":88153,"title":"Knee shape might predict clinical outcome after an anterior cruciate ligament rupture.","abstract":"We have investigated whether shape of the knee can predict the clinical outcome of patients after an anterior cruciate ligament rupture. We used statistical shape modelling to measure the shape of the knee joint of 182 prospectively followed patients on lateral and Rosenberg view radiographs of the knee after a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. Subsequently, we associated knee shape with the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score at two years follow-up. The mean age of patients was 31 years (21 to 51), the majority were male (n = 121) and treated operatively (n = 135). We found two modes (shape variations) that were significantly associated with the subjective score at two years: one for the operatively treated group (p = 0.002) and one for the non-operatively treated group (p = 0.003). Operatively treated patients who had higher subjective scores had a smaller intercondylar notch and a smaller width of the intercondylar eminence. Non-operatively treated patients who scored higher on the subjective score had a more pyramidal intercondylar notch as opposed to one that was more dome-shaped. We conclude that the shape of the femoral notch and the intercondylar eminence is predictive of clinical outcome two years after a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891572","annotations":[{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.926634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.632539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.57298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.543255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Intercondylar eminence","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercondylar_eminence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0291129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Pyramid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Variation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"}]}
