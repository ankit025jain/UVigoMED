{"id":89151,"title":"[Iron metabolism and its role in traumatic disease].","abstract":"The article reviews recent studies of iron exchange and its role in a traumatic disease and traumatic shock. The review stresses a relationship of iron metabolism disturbance with free radical oxidation, lipid peroxidation and multiple organ dysfunctions. The article deals with data of unbound iron collect mechanisms, ways of endotoxemia activation, haemostasis and haemodynamics disturbance proving the role of iron in a multiple organ dysfunctions during traumatic disease.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749318","annotations":[{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.877245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.48368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.477373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Human iron metabolism","weight":0.229457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_iron_metabolism"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0845957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Endotoxemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxemia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Bound state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state"}]}
