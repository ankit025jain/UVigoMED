{"id":34810,"title":"Correlation of Pirani and Dimeglio scores with number of Ponseti casts required for clubfoot correction.","abstract":"A number of grading systems for severity of clubfoot have been reported in the literature, but none are universally accepted. The aim of this study was to find the correlation between 2 of the most widely utilized classification systems (the Pirani score and the Dimeglio score) with number of Ponseti casts required to achieve initial clubfeet correction.A retrospective study of prospectively collected data was performed. All clubfeet assessed at our dedicated clubfoot clinic from January 2007 to December 2011 were included. Clubfoot severity was assessed using both the Pirani score and the Dimeglio score. The total number of casts was calculated from the first cast to the time of initiation of the foot abduction orthosis.The mean number of Ponseti casts required to achieve initial correction was 5.8 (range, 2 to 10 casts). A low correlation (rs 0.21) was identified when the total Dimeglio score was compared with the number of casts. No correlation (rs 0.12) was identified between the Pirani score and the number of casts.The Dimeglio and Pirani scores remain the most widely accepted clubfoot severity grading systems. However, their prognostic value remains questionable, at least in the early treatment stages.Prognostic study level II.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705346","annotations":[{"name":"Literature","weight":0.160106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0646925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Club foot","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_foot"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Level II trauma center","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_II_trauma_center"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
