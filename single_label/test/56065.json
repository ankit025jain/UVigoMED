{"id":56065,"title":"Myocardial infarction increases progressive visual field defects in well treated early primary open angle glaucoma--a prospective case control study.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the progression of glaucomatous field damage in patients with stable primary open angle glaucoma after an attack of myocardial infarction. In this case control study, 62 open angle glaucoma patients were selected and regularly followed up. Among 62 patients, 9 had an attack of myocardial infarction. The intra-ocular pressure and visual field progression of both the groups (myocardial infarction versus no myocardial infarction) were analysed. Three (33.3%) out of 9 patients who had suffered from myocardial infarction showed progressive visual field loss whereas only 9 (16.9%) out of 53 patients who did not suffer from myocardial infarction, showed progressive field changes. Both the groups had stable target intra-ocular pressure between 14 and 16 mm Hg. Myocardial infarction may adversely influence the progression of primary open angle glaucoma which is suspected to result from ischaemia induced neuronal loss and only control of intraocular pressure is not the only solution. We have to look for other drugs that prevents ischaemia induced neuronal damage.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761499","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.802254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.679028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.675808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.584129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.461886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.382418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.241148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0703685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"16 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"New Hampshire primary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"}]}
