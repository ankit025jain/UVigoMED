{"id":84016,"title":"Hair tourniquet syndrome in the dental patient.","abstract":"Hair tourniquet syndrome is a condition where a hair becomes entangled around an appendage. In some cases a knot will form and the resulting tightened noose will slowly strangulate the appendage. Rarely, this condition will affect the oral cavity, but even more rarely, this condition will affect a dental structure.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25191985","annotations":[{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.274585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Appendage","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendage"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tourniquet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourniquet"},{"name":"Quantum entanglement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement"},{"name":"Noose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noose"},{"name":"Strangulating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangulating"},{"name":"Knot","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
