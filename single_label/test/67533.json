{"id":67533,"title":"ASC in renal collecting duct epithelial cells contributes to inflammation and injury after unilateral ureteral obstruction.","abstract":"Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiological characteristics of chronic kidney disease; however, the inflammatory mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease process remain unclear. Recent evidence indicates that sterile inflammation triggered by tissue injury is mediated through a multiprotein complex called the inflammasome. Therefore, we investigated the role of the inflammasome in the development of chronic kidney disease using a murine unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model. Inflammasome-related molecules were up-regulated in the kidney after UUO. Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain deficiency significantly reduced inflammatory responses, such as inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine expression, and improved subsequent renal injury and fibrosis. Furthermore, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain was specifically up-regulated in collecting duct (CD) epithelial cells of the UUO-treated kidney. In vitro experiments showed that extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) induced inflammasome activation in CD epithelial cells through P2X7-potassium efflux and reactive oxygen species-dependent pathways. These results demonstrate the molecular basis for the inflammatory response in the process of chronic kidney disease and suggest the CD inflammasome as a potential therapeutic target for preventing chronic kidney disease progression.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital
