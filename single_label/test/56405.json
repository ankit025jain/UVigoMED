{"id":56405,"title":"Multimodal imaging of exudative maculopathy associated with hand-foot-mouth disease.","abstract":"A 31-year-old man presented with acute unilateral visual loss secondary to hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). Ophthalmic examination demonstrated best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/24 and a macular neurosensory detachment. He was diagnosed with unilateral acute idiopathic maculopathy (UAIM), and multimodality imaging was performed. No treatment was warranted. At 3 months, BCVA was 6/5 and funduscopy revealed a juxtafoveal scar. Based on the evidence of the association between HFMD and UAIM, the authors refer to this condition as exudative maculopathy associated with HFMD. Multimodality imaging during acute and convalescent phases is useful to study this disorder and raises questions about choroidal and bilateral involvement. Ophthalmologists should be aware of this and query about systemic signs and symptoms.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695047","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.8195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.641692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.58699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.425048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Convalescence","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convalescence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Hand, foot and mouth disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand,_foot_and_mouth_disease"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"624","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/624"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Maculopathy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopathy"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 31","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_31"}]}
