{"id":68535,"title":"Involvement of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C in proliferation and invasion of prostate carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C) has been found to participate in the process of several cancers. However, the role of UBE2C in prostate cancer has not been reported. To investigate the function of UBE2C in prostate cancer, several methods were used. UBE2C promoted the proliferation and viability of prostate cancer cells through MTT and colony formation assay and increased the number of invaded or migrated cells in Matrigel or Transwell assay based on its function of inducing EMT. UBE2C also promoted tumor formation in vivo. Our results suggest that UBE2C acts as an oncogene in prostate cancer progression and may be a candidate marker of diagnosis for this disease.
