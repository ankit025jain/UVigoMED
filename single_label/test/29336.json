{"id":29336,"title":"A dose for the wiser is enough: the alcohol benefits for associative learning in zebrafish.","abstract":"This study aimed to test seeking behavior caused by alcohol and the drug effects on learning in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Three treatments were conducted: acute, chronic and withdrawal, using 0.10%, 0.25%, and 1.00% alcohol and control (0.00%) (vol/vol.%). For the drug seeking behavior, we used a place preference paradigm (shuttle box tank) before and after alcohol exposure in acute (single exposure) and chronic (7 days) treatments. We observed a change in the basal preference due to the association with alcohol only for 0.25% and 1.00% doses in both acute and chronic offering, indicating an alcohol-seeking behavior after the drug exposure. For the learning task, two treatments were tested: chronic alcohol exposure (26 days including the learning period) and alcohol withdrawal (15 days of alcohol exposure before the learning period). During the learning period, fish received light stimulus followed by food in a pre-defined area of the tank for 8 consecutive days. The low dose group (0.10%) learned the task by the 3rd day both in chronic and withdrawal treatments. The higher doses (0.25% and 1.00%) caused a learning impairment in the chronic treatment group, while fish from the alcohol withdrawal treatment displayed learning on the final testing day. Therefore, we suggest that high alcohol doses impair learning and cause drug seeking behavior, even after drug exposure cessation, while low doses positively affect learning and do not cause seeking behavior. Given our results we propose that the zebrafish is a promising model for identifying active compounds, antibodies or genes which modulate the alcohol dual effects: learning improvement and reinforcing behavior.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681197","annotations":[{"name":"Drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.646359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.640126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Zebrafish","weight":0.633278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.595775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.517844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.488016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0894997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Danio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danio"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Public transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Associative property","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
