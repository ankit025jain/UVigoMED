{"id":44122,"title":"HLA-DQ polymorphisms with HBV infection: different outcomes upon infection and prognosis to lamivudine therapy.","abstract":"Two recent genome-wide studies showed that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the HLA-DQ region (rs2856718 and rs9275572) were associated with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and chronic hepatitis C virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in Japanese patients. We tested the effects of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms for all major HBV outcomes and lamivudine treatment in Han Chinese. A total of 1649 samples were enrolled, and peripheral blood samples were collected in this study. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the HLA-DQ region were genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Our study demonstrated the clear relevance of HLA-DQ rs2856718 and rs9275572 with HBV susceptibility, natural clearance and HBV-associated HCC. HLA-DQ rs2856718G and rs9275572A were strongly associated with decreased risk of chronic HBV infection (odds ratio = 0.641; P = 2.64 × 10(-4) ; odds ratio = 0.627, P = 7.22 × 10(-5) ) and HBV natural clearance (odds ratio = 0.610; P = 4.80 × 10(-4) ; odds ratio = 0.714, P = 0.013). Moreover, rs9275572A was also associated with development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (odds ratio = 0.632, P = 0.008). In addition, we showed for the first time to our knowledge that rs9275572 was a predictor for lamivudine therapy (viral response: odds ratio = 2.599, P = 4.43 × 10(-4) ; biochemical response: odds ratio = 2.279, P = 4.23 × 10(-4) ). Our study suggested that HLA-DQ loci were associated with both HBV clearance and HBV-related diseases and outcomes of lamivudine treatment in Han Chinese.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750255","annotations":[{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.796614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"China","weight":0.369763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.263867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Flight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
