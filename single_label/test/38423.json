{"id":38423,"title":"Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 (anti-Yo) autoimmunity in a child with Down syndrome.","abstract":"Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 (PCA-1)-IgG (or anti-Yo) is characteristically detected in women with gynecological or breast adenocarcinoma. We describe 2 unique scenarios occurring in 1 patient: PCA-1 paraneoplastic autoimmunity in a child, and a paraneoplastic neurological disorder in the context of Down syndrome.A child with Down syndrome and a history of adrenocortical carcinoma resected at age 1 year presented at age 7 years with cerebellar ataxia of subacute onset. Paraneoplastic serological and cerebrospinal fluid evaluations revealed PCA-1. Serological and biochemical studies also supported a diagnosis of subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism. Extensive serum, urine, and radiological testing did not reveal a new or recurrent neoplasm. Neurological improvements after standard immunotherapy were lacking.Solid organ neoplasms are uncommon among patients with Down syndrome, but organ-specific autoimmune diseases are common. In our patient, Down syndrome-related impaired T regulatory lymphocyte function (previously reported) may have resulted in both enhanced immunity against an undetected solid neoplasm and paraneoplastic neurological (PCA-1) autoimmunity.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424854","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Purkinje cell","weight":0.862041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Paraneoplastic syndrome","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraneoplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.660183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.506713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.446886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.313174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.160853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Cerebellar ataxia","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_ataxia"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0505576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
