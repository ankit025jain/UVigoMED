{"id":91045,"title":"Fifty-year follow-up of late-detected hip dislocation: clinical and radiographic outcomes for seventy-one patients treated with traction to obtain gradual closed reduction.","abstract":"There is little knowledge concerning outcomes for middle-aged adults who were treated for late-detected developmental dislocation of the hip. The aims of this retrospective study were to evaluate the fifty-year clinical and radiographic results after closed reduction and to identify prognostic factors.Seventy-one patients (ninety hips) with late-detected hip dislocation treated between 1958 and 1962 were assessed clinically and radiographically. The primary treatment was skin traction to obtain a gradual closed reduction. The mean age of the patients at the time of the long-term radiographic examination was 51.6 years (range, forty-four to fifty-five years).A stable reduction was achieved in eighty-three hips. The mean age at reduction was 1.7 years (range, 0.3 to 5.4 years). Traction failed in six patients (seven hips [8%]), for whom an open reduction was necessary. Twenty-six patients (thirty hips) underwent late surgical procedures because of residual hip dysplasia. A good long-term clinical outcome (a Harris hip score of ?85 points) after closed reduction was assessed for fifty-two (63%) of the hips. A satisfactory radiographic outcome (no osteoarthritis) was found for fifty-six (67%) of the hips. Osteoarthritis had developed in twenty-seven (33%) of the hips, of which nineteen had undergone total hip replacement, performed at a mean patient age of 43.7 years (range, thirty-one to fifty-four years). Risk factors for osteoarthritis were an older age at the time of reduction, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, residual subluxation, a high acetabular index during childhood, and a classification of Severin grades III or IV at skeletal maturity. A survival analysis showed a reduction in \"surviving\" hips (no total hip replacement) from 99% at a patient age of thirty years to 74% at the age of fifty-two years.With a mean follow-up of fifty years, the clinical and radiographic outcomes after gradual closed reduction by skin traction were satisfactory in approximately two-thirds of eighty-three hips. The most important independent risk factors for a poor long-term outcome were an age of eighteen months or older at the time of reduction, residual subluxation, and osteonecrosis.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553897","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (canine)","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(canine)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.716423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.621664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.528692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.443318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.426743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.351152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Dislocation of hip","weight":0.14701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation_of_hip"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0989523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.0326281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0173036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
