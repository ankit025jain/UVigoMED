{"id":88425,"title":"Breakthrough ideas leading to new futures: next steps.","abstract":"In 2010, the educational International Surgical Wound Forum (ISWF) was created to facilitate discussion among global experts regarding modern wound treatment challenges and how negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) could be used to address those challenges. This is the second of two supplements, which are based on 2012 and 2013 ISWF presentations and demonstrate the evolution of NPWT's role in wound care. The previous supplement provided an overview of critical health care issues and current clinical practice and reviewed evidence and experience using NPWT with instillation of topical wound solutions. This supplement presents clinical experience using negative pressure over closed surgical incisions, in the open abdomen, and in wounds with enteroatmospheric fistulas.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851727","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.212919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Negative pressure wound therapy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_pressure_wound_therapy"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Futures contract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"},{"name":"Instillation abortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instillation_abortion"},{"name":"Health care in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"}]}
