{"id":88082,"title":"Assessing characteristics related to the use of seatbelts and cell phones by drivers: application of a bivariate probit model.","abstract":"The effects of cell phone use and safety belt use have been an important focus of research related to driver safety. Cell phone use has been shown to be a significant source of driver distraction contributing to substantial degradations in driver performance, while safety belts have been demonstrated to play a vital role in mitigating injuries to crash-involved occupants.This study examines the prevalence of cell phone use and safety belt non-use among the driving population through direct observation surveys. A bivariate probit model is developed to simultaneously examine the factors that affect cell phone and safety belt use among motor vehicle drivers.The results show that several factors may influence drivers' decision to use cell phones and safety belts, and that these decisions are correlated.Understanding the factors that affect both cell phone use and safety belt non-use is essential to targeting policy and programs that reduce such behavior.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24913479","annotations":[{"name":"Seat belt","weight":0.596144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.423723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Motor vehicle","weight":0.243561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"},{"name":"Road traffic safety","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.188519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Probit model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probit_model"},{"name":"Probit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probit"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Belt (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Climate change mitigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Distraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction"}]}
