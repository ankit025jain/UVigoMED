{"id":20102,"title":"Identification of temporal clusters and risk factors of bacteremia by nosocomial vancomycin-resistant enterococci.","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate a different methodology for addressing the evolution of nosocomial bacteremia by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in a hospital setting.In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected from the date of first registration up to December 2008 from the electronic medical records of patients with VRE bacteremia in a school hospital.Thirty cases of VRE bacteremia and 274 cases of vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) bacteremia were identified. The average age of the patients was 56 years. The rates of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) and wards showed no statistically significant differences. The risk of acquiring VRE bacteremia was at least 3-fold higher in the ICU than in the wards. The risk of death was 2.73-fold higher in patients with VRE bacteremia compared with those with VSE bacteremia. Only one temporal cluster statistically significant of VRE bacteremia was found in the study period.The identification of temporal clusters can be an important tool to optimize health actions and thereby reduce the burden of operating costs.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679566","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.634501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.570065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.391329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.341937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecium"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin-resistant_Enterococcus"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
