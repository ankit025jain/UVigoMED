{"id":59769,"title":"[Research advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in children].","abstract":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), is characterized clinically by abrupt onset and progressive deterioration and even death. HLH is much more prevalent in children, and is potentially fatal if early diagnosis is not made and appropriate HLH-directed therapy not instituted. Increasing genetic defects and underlying diseases or causative factors have been identified to be closely implicated in the pathogenesis of HLH. In addition, great advances have been made in the past few years in terms of HLH diagnosis and clinical management. In the present review, the cause of disease, contemporary classification, epidemiology, genetic defects and molecular mechanisms, updated diagnostic criteria and novel treatment strategies for childhood HLH are summarized.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130849","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.435876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"}]}
