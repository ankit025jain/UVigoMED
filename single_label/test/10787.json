{"id":10787,"title":"Calponin1 inhibits dilated cardiomyopathy development in mice through the ?PKC pathway.","abstract":"Calponin1 (CNN1) is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction in physiological situation and it also expresses abnormally in a variety of pathological situations. We found that the expression of CNN1 decreased significantly in the heart tissue of a cTnT(R141W) transgenic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mouse model and an adriamycin (ADR)-induced DCM mouse model, suggesting that CNN1 is involved in the pathogenesis of DCM. However, the role of CNN1 on cardiac function, especially on pathogenesis of DCM, has not been clarified. In this study, we tested whether rescued expression of CNN1 could prevent the development of DCM and investigated its possible mechanisms.The DCM phenotypes were significantly improved with the transgenic expression of CNN1 in the cTnT(R141W)×CNN1 double transgenic (DTG) mice, which was demonstrated by the survival, cardiac geometry and function analyses, as well as microstructural and ultrastructural observations based on echocardiography and histology examination. The expression of CNN1 could also resist the cardiac geometry breakage and dysfunction in the ADR-induced DCM mice model. Meanwhile, the epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (?PKC) activator and inhibitor could reverse the activation of ?PKC/ERK/mTOR pathway and DCM phenotypes in the cTnT(R141W) and cTnT(R141W)×CNN1 double transgenic (DTG) mice.?PKC/ERK/mTOR pathway activation induced by the rescued expression of CNN1 contributed to the improvement of cardiac dysfunction and pathological changes observed in the DTG mice. CNN1 could be a therapeutic target to prevent the development of DCM and heart failure (HF).","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631115","annotations":[{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.888243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.85423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.727475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.718366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.579913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.54182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.450172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.443392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.386533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"CNN","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"},{"name":"Calponin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calponin"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
