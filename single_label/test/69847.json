{"id":69847,"title":"Impact of comorbidity on initial treatment and overall survival in elderly head and neck cancer patients.","abstract":"Comorbidity is a determinant of treatment selection and survival in various cancers including head and neck cancer (HNC) and is often associated with a higher utilization of non-curative intent treatment.In this retrospective study we analyzed 182 consecutively treated HNC patients >65 years old at the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center from January 2000-June 2007. Comorbidity was assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Treatment was classified as curative vs. non-curative intent.Median overall survival was 883 days. Patients with a CCI score 0-2 had non-significant higher rate of curative intent treatment than patients with CCI score >2 (83.8% vs. 74.6%, p=0.13). In multivariate analysis, only stage had significant prognostic importance (hazard ratio (HR) 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.14; p<0.0005). In separate multivariate analyses of patients treated with surgery or chemoradiation, CCI was not a significant predictor of survival with HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.69-1.11; p=0.29) and 1.13 (95% CI 0.83-1.53; p=0.44), respectively.In our elderly HNC population, CCI was not an independent predictor of selection of curative intent treatment or overall survival.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275053","annotations":[{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.645849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.614563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.567113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.476403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.213585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Higher National Certificate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_National_Certificate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"831","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/831"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"883","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/883"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Veterans Health Administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dallas","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas"}]}
