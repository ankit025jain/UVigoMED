{"id":47632,"title":"[Comparison of two kinds of enzyme-linked immunosorbnent assay for detection of anti-hepatitis C].","abstract":"To compare the difference of sensitivity and specificity on the results of the same samples determined by indirect ELISA and sandwich ELISA.A 51 anti-HCV positive serum samples obtained from donors were screened by two indirect ELISA kits initially, and then were detected using one sandwich ELISA kit, and were confirmed by recombinent immunoblot assay (RIBA) and HCV-RNA.To compared with HCV-RNA, false positive rate of two kinds of indirect ELISA and one sandwich ELISA was 40.9%, 59.1% and 2.2% respectively. The positive rates of them were 100%, but the analytical sensitivity of sandwich ELISA was more than indirect ELISA 2 to 6 times.The sensitivity and specificity of sandwich ELISA was significantly better than those of indirect ELISA.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579483","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.463889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.112395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.0632701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"Royal Institute of British Architects","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Sandwich","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich"},{"name":"List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Tag_Team_Champions_(WWE)"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
