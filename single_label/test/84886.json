{"id":84886,"title":"Nanoencapsulation of tacrolimus in lipid-core nanocapsules showed similar immunosuppressive activity after oral and intraperitoneal administrations.","abstract":"Tacrolimus is widely used in the prophylaxis of solid-organ transplant rejection. Several studies have reported that tacrolimus has variable and poor bioavailability after oral administration, apart from adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disorders, hyperglycemia, nephro- and neurotoxicity. The aim of this work was to encapsulate tacrolimus (TAC) in lipid-core nanocapsules (LNC) as an oral strategy to deliver the drug. To validate our hypothesis, the pharmacodynamic effect of TAC-LNC was determined after oral and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administrations to mice. TAC-LNC had z-average diameter of 210 nm (unimodal), and 99.5% of encapsulation efficiency. In vitro sustained release was determined for TAC-LNC fitting an anomalous transport mechanism (n = 0.8). TAC-LNC demonstrated higher immunosuppressive activity after oral and i.p. administrations, when compared to the drug solution. TAC-LNC administered at 6.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1) showed equivalent percent reduction in lymphocyte when both routes of administration were used. After oral administration, drug nanoencapsulation allows reducing the dose by at least 40%. Furthermore, the nanoencapsulation of TAC in lipid-core nanocapsules showed pharmacodynamic effect similar for the oral and the i.p. routes. In conclusion, the lipid-core nanocapsules were able to improve the TAC deliver across the oral absorption barrier.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016659","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.869195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.784186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.685683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.635208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.533361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.520478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.479809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.443527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.311024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"}]}
