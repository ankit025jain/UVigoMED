{"id":4383,"title":"[Large trophozoites in blood smear of falciparum malaria: one case report].","abstract":"This paper reports one case of atypical falciparum malaria imported from Africa, whose blood smear contains many large trophozoites, with punctiform or massive brown pigment granules, the body shape of the plasmodium is similar to that of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. After the gene detection by PCR, the case was diagnosed as falciparum malaria. As large trophozoites were rarely seen in the peripheral blood of non-severe falciparum malaria cases, much attention should be paid to the identification of Plasmodium falciparum and other plasmodia in microscopic examinations.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345178","annotations":[{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Plasmodium ovale","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.80241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Blood film","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.761379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.439001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.428393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Brown trout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_trout"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
