{"id":9262,"title":"Mixed triple: allied viruses in unique recent isolates of highly virulent type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus detected by deep sequencing.","abstract":"In February 2013, very severe acute clinical symptoms were observed in calves, heifers, and dairy cattle in several farms in North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony, Germany. Deep sequencing revealed the coexistence of three distinct genome variants within recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVDV-2) isolates. While the major portion (ca. 95%) of the population harbored a duplication of a 222-nucleotide (nt) segment within the p7-NS2-encoding region, the minority reflected the standard structure of a BVDV-2 genome. Additionally, unusual mutations were found in both variants, within the highly conserved p7 protein and close to the p7-NS2 cleavage site. Using a reverse genetic system with a BVDV-2a strain harboring a similar duplication, it could be demonstrated that during replication, genomes without duplication are generated de novo from genomes with duplication. The major variant with duplication is compulsorily escorted by the minor variant without duplication. RNA secondary structure prediction allowed the analysis of the unique but stable mixture of three BVDV variants and also provided the explanation for their generation. Finally, our results suggest that the variant with duplication plays the major role in the highly virulent phenotype.This study emphasizes the importance of full-genome deep sequencing in combination with manual in-depth data analysis for the investigation of viruses in basic research and diagnostics. Here we investigated recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus isolates from a 2013 series of outbreaks. We discovered a unique special feature of the viral genome, an unstable duplication of 222 nucleotides which is eventually deleted by viral polymerase activity, leading to an unexpectedly mixed population of viral genomes for all investigated isolates. Our study is of high importance to the field because we demonstrate that these insertion/deletion events allow another level of genome plasticity of plus-strand RNA viruses, in addition to the well-known polymerase-induced single nucleotide variations which are generally considered the main basis for viral adaptation and evolution.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Animal
