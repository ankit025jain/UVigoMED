{"id":56874,"title":"Ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography in retinal disease.","abstract":"Ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography (UWFA), which captures up to 200Â° of retina in a single image, now affords us the ability to angiographically examine the parts of the retina previously not photographable. Here, we review the role of UWFA in the management of retinal disease.UWFA effectively images the abnormality in a variety of retinal conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, sickle cell retinopathy, uveitis, and pediatric retinal disease, in turn guiding both diagnosis and management of these conditions.UWFA is a useful imaging modality that is expected to become increasingly incorporated into the practice of retina. This will likely fuel the studies to determine how to reconcile the findings from UWFA with practice guidelines based on the studies conducted prior to the development of UWFA.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614144","annotations":[{"name":"Retina","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.786982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.762764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.531909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.311111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.281299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.152918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Sickle-cell disease","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Fuel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"},{"name":"Sickle","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
