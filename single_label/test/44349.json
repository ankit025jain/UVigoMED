{"id":44349,"title":"Association of a genetic variant in microRNA-146a with risk of colorectal cancer: a population-based case-control study.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate target gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Although recent studies have indicated that miR-146a is involved in the tumorigenesis of various types of malignancies, few studies have investigated its role in colorectal cancer. In the current study, we examined the expression of miR-146a in colorectal cancer tissue and adjacent normal controls using publicly available expression profiling data. We then conducted a population-based case-control study which included 554 colorectal cancer cases and 566 matched healthy controls to assess the association of a genetic variant (rs2910164) in miR-146a with colorectal cancer susceptibility. We observed decreased expression of miR-146a in rectal cancer tissue compared with adjacent normal controls (P < 0.001). Association between miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer was detected with effect modification by alcohol drinking status (P for interaction = 0.010). Among non-alcohol drinkers, individuals with CC/CG genotype had an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with those carrying GG genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 1.63, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.07 ? 2.47). Our findings indicate an association between miR-146a dysregulation and colorectal cancer, and suggest that miR-146a may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Further large population-based prospective studies as well as mechanistic investigations are warranted to validate our findings.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740563","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.785599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.777392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.773336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.691361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.600403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.515743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.513652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.499113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.201854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0867165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"}]}
