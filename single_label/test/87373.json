{"id":87373,"title":"[Case-control study on treatment of distal tibiofibula fractures with modified anterolateral or traditional approach].","abstract":"To explore therapeutic effects of modified anterolateral approach and traditional approach in treating distal tibiofibula fractures.From September 2009 to December 2012,45 patients with distal tibiofibula fractures were performed reduction and interal fixation with modified anterolateral and traditional approaches. According to Ruedi-All-gower classification, 12 cases were type I ,26 cases were type II, 7 cases were type III. Among 45 patients,there were 16 males and 7 females with an average age of (36.3 +/- 7.2) years old (ranged from 23 to 47) years old in advanced group; while there were 14 males and 8 females with an average of (33.8 +/- 6.4) years old (ranged from 25 to 45) in tradtional group. Operation time, blood loss, complications of incision were compared, and AOFAS scores were evaluated.All patients were followed up from 6 to 36 months with an average of 21.7 months. In traditional group, operation time was (74.7 +/- 9.9) min, blood loss was (94.4 +/- 10.4) ml, and (73.7 +/- 10.0) min, (100.8 +/- 12.1) ml in advanced group,there was no significant meaning between two groups (P > 0.05); complications of insicion of advanced group was better than that of traditional group (chi2 = 4.078, P < 0.05); AOFAS score in advanced group (86.1 +/- 9.4) was better than that of traditional group, and had significant meaning (t = 3.787, P < 0.05).Modified anterolateral group,which has advantages of rapid recovery, less complications, is a good choice for closed distal tibiofibula fractures.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241459","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.466709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.454764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.356942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.197271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.145315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
