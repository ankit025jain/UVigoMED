{"id":20675,"title":"Humoral immunity and CD4+ Th1 cells are both necessary for a fully protective immune response upon secondary infection with Brucella melitensis.","abstract":"Brucella spp are intracellular bacteria that cause brucellosis, one of the most common zoonoses in the world. Given the serious medical consequences of this disease, a safe and effective human vaccine is urgently needed. Efforts to develop this vaccine have been hampered by our lack of understanding of what constitutes a protective memory response against Brucella. In this study, we characterize the cells and signaling pathways implicated in the generation of a protective immune memory response following priming by the injection of heat-killed or live Brucella melitensis 16M. Using a panel of gene-deficient mice, we demonstrated that during a secondary recall response, both the Brucella-specific humoral response and CD4+ Th1 cells must act together to confer protective immunity in the spleen to B. melitensis infection. Humoral protective immunity is induced by the inoculation of both heat-killed and live bacteria, and its development does not require T cells, MyD88/IL-12p35 signaling pathways, or an activation-induced deaminase-mediated isotype switch. In striking contrast, the presence of memory IFN-?-producing CD4+ Th1 cells requires the administration of live bacteria and functional MyD88/IL-12p35 pathways. In summary, our work identifies several immune markers closely associated with protective immune memory and could help to define a rational strategy to obtain an effective human vaccine against brucellosis.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646742","annotations":[{"name":"Brucellosis","weight":0.915556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucellosis"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.772623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.637566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.265447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Isotype (immunology)","weight":0.248996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(immunology)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Secondary infection","weight":0.0481939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_infection"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Brucella melitensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucella_melitensis"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Brucella","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucella"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"}]}
