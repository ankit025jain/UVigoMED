{"id":82145,"title":"Immunological characterization of the allergic contact mucositis related to the ingestion of nickel-rich foods.","abstract":"The ingestion of nickel (Ni)-rich foods may result in allergic contact mucositis (ACM), a not yet well defined condition identifiable by oral mucosa patch test (omPT). Our aim was to characterize immunologically the ACM taking advantage from the allergen exposure that occurs during the omPT for Ni.Thirty-seven symptomatic patients underwent to omPT for Ni. Before and after omPT, serum and urine Ni concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry, the white blood cells were counted by hemochromocytometric assay, the peripheral lymphocyte typing was carried out by flow cytometry, total IgE and cytokine serum concentrations were measured by immunoenzymatic assays. The local lymphocyte typing was performed by immunohistochemistry only after omPT.According to the omPT outcomes, 25 patients were defined as Ni-sensitive and the remaining 12 as controls. After omPT, serum and urine Ni concentrations increased significantly in all patients, while a significant increment of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils was highlighted, respectively, in Ni-sensitive and control patients. Consistently, the Th and Tc circulating lymphocytes, as well as the Th/Tc ratio increased significantly in Ni-sensitive patients after omPT. No noteworthy increment in serum concentrations of total IgE and selected cytokines was observed in any patient after omPT. The presence of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells was highlighted on the oral mucosa biopsy samples taken from Ni-sensitive patients after omPT.In patients with ACM, a local adaptive response with increased lymphocyte trafficking appears to be the most likely mechanism of reaction to Ni administered with the omPT.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703602","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.879201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.614344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.558639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.543318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.528852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.439931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.385184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.374558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.334462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Nickel","weight":0.112803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0623369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Transdermal patch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal_patch"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
