{"id":89657,"title":"Flow-controlled expiration: a novel ventilation mode to attenuate experimental porcine lung injury.","abstract":"Whereas the effects of various inspiratory ventilatory modifications in lung injury have extensively been studied, those of expiratory ventilatory modifications are less well known. We hypothesized that the newly developed flow-controlled expiration (FLEX) mode provides a means of attenuating experimental lung injury.Experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome was induced by i.v. injection of oleic acid in 15 anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs. After established lung injury ([Formula: see text]ratio <27 kPa), animals were randomized to either a control group receiving volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) or a treatment group receiving VCV with additional FLEX (VCV+FLEX). At predefined times, lung mechanics and oxygenation were assessed. At the end of the experiment, the pigs were killed, and bronchoalveolar fluid and lung biopsies were taken. Expression of inflammatory cytokines was analysed in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar fluid. Lung injury score was determined on the basis of stained tissue samples.Compared with the control group (VCV; n=8), the VCV+FLEX group (n=7) demonstrated greater dynamic lung compliance and required less PEEP at comparable [Formula: see text] (both P<0.05), had lower regional lung wet-to-dry ratios and lung injury scores (both P<0.001), and showed less thickening of alveolar walls (an indicator of interstitial oedema) and de novo migration of macrophages into lung tissue (both P<0.001).The newly developed FLEX mode is able to attenuate experimental lung injury. FLEX could provide a novel means of lung-protective ventilation.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Wounds and
