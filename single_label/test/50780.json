{"id":50780,"title":"[Clinical efficacy observation on therapy ovulation failure infertility caursed by PCOS with reinforcing kidney, activating blood circulation and ovarian stimulation compound recipe].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical effect of tonifying the kidney and promoting blood circulation to promote oocyte decoction in the treatment of anovulatory infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. Sixty cases were selected from the out-patient department of Xiyuan hospital of China academy of Chinese medical sciences and the Chinese academy of traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine out-patient department. Sixty patients with PCOS patients were randomly divided into the treatment group and the control group, with 30 cases and 30 cases respectively. The treatment group was given decoction of the reinforcing kidney, activating blood circulation and ovarian stimulation compound recipe. The control group was treated with clomiphene. Through the treatment of 1-2 courses, in the treatment group the pregnancy rate was 56.67%, the ovulation rate 61%; in control group of clomiphene citrate ovulation ratepregnancy rate was 30% , 72.84% of ovulation rate. The difference was significant between two groups (P < 0.05), the pregnancy rate in the treatment group was higher than the control group. The treatment group has regulatory effect on FSH, LH and their ratio, and increase E2 level, decrease T, PRL, INS and other hormone levels, contributing to the mature development of the follicles and endometrium growth, increase the ovulation rate and pregnancy rate. The control group on FSH, E2 increased, LH, T, PRL and INS showed no obvious effect.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754183","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.932498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.827195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.805458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.792431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Clomifene","weight":0.780826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene"},{"name":"China","weight":0.779701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.580621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.559775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.529175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Anovulation","weight":0.400902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anovulation"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.293166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.246865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.237719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.169146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Healthcare science","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_science"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.11851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Decoction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Recipe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Citric acid","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"}]}
