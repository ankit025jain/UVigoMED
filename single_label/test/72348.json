{"id":72348,"title":"Surgical treatment of jugular foramen schwannomas.","abstract":"We present our experience with surgery of jugular foramen schwannomas with special consideration of clinical presentation, surgical technique, complications, and outcomes.This retrospective study includes ten patients with jugular foramen schwannomas treated by the senior author between January 2007 and December 2012. Three patients had undergone partial tumour resection elsewhere. The initial symptom for which they sought medical help was hearing loss, dysphagia, hoarseness, and shoulder weakness. Preoperative glossopharyngeal and vagal nerve deficits were the most common signs. In our series, tumour extension was classified according to Kaye-Pellet grading system. In two cases the tumours were classified into type A and 8 patients presented with type D tumours. A retromastoid suboccipital craniotomy was performed for type A tumours and modifications of cranio-cervical approach were suitable for type D.No death occurred in this series. Four patients deteriorated after surgery: in two patients preoperative cranial nerve deficits deteriorated after surgery while new cranial nerve palsy occurred in 2 other patients. In four patients, the cranial nerve dysfunction had improved at the last follow-up examination. In all other patients, the cranial nerve dysfunction remained the same. One patient experienced tumour recurrence over a follow-up period of 40 months. This patient underwent a successful second surgery without further evidence of tumour growth.Jugular foramen schwannomas can be radically managed with the use of skull base surgery techniques. However, the surgical treatment of jugular foramen schwannomas carries a significant risk of the lower CN deficits.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981183","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Craniotomy","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniotomy"},{"name":"Cranial nerve","weight":0.819812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerve"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vagus nerve","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.665761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.591466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.520859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.370048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Jugular foramen","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_foramen"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.0200714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Suboccipital muscles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suboccipital_muscles"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Cyanide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide"},{"name":"Foramen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Base of skull","weight":0.0113784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_of_skull"}]}
