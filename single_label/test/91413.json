{"id":91413,"title":"Nonunion of paediatric talar neck fracture.","abstract":"Fractures of the paediatric talus are infrequent injuries, most complicated by posttraumatic arthrosis and avascular necrosis in the course of treatment. Nonunion in children has not been reported before in literature. We report a case of a 12-year-old boy who had a nonunion of Hawkins type II fracture of talar neck. The nonunion was treated surgically with a good clinical outcome. The goals of management in nonunion of paediatric talar neck fracture are different from those in fresh fractures. A suboptimal reduction should be acceptable without trying a radical surgery which may cause further impairment.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506925","annotations":[{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.751693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.692776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.523591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.391533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.297996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.115812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Talus bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talus_bone"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
