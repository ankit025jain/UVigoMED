{"id":63032,"title":"Hes1 upregulation contributes to the development of FIP1L1-PDGRA-positive leukemia in blast crisis.","abstract":"We have previously shown that elevated expression of Hairy enhancer of split 1 (Hes1) contributes to blast crisis transition in Bcr-Abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Here we investigate whether Hes1 is involved in the development of other myeloid neoplasms. Notably, Hes1 expression was elevated in only a few cases of 65 samples with different types of myeloid neoplasms. Interestingly, elevated expression of Hes1 was found in two of five samples of Fip1-like1 platelet-derived growth factor receptor-? (FIP1L1-PDGFA)-positive myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia. Whereas FIP1L1-PDGFR? alone induced acute T-cell leukemia or myeloproliferative neoplasms in mouse bone marrow transplantation models, mice transplanted with bone marrow cells expressing both Hes1 and FIP1L1-PDGFR? developed acute leukemia characterized by an expansion of myeloid blasts and leukemic cells without eosinophilic granules. FIP1L1-PDGFR? conferred cytokine-independent growth to Hes1-transduced common myeloid progenitors, interleukin-3-dependent cells. Imatinib inhibited the growth of common myeloid progenitors expressing Hes1 with FIP1L1-PDGFR?, but not with imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFR? mutants harboring T674I or D842V. In contrast, ponatinib efficiently eradicated leukemic cells expressing Hes1 and the imatinib-resistant FLP1L1-PDGFR? mutant in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have established mouse models of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive leukemia in myeloid blast crisis, which will help elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and develop a new treatment for it.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486648","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic myelogenous
