{"id":24423,"title":"Role of combined zinc, vitamin A, and fish oil supplementation in childhood tuberculosis.","abstract":"This objective of this study was to determine benefit of one month combined supplementation (zinc, vitamin A, fish oil) along with anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATD) on increasing serum leptin levels and decreasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in children with tuberculosis (TB). A quasi experimental study was conducted on 22 children (aged 5-14 years) with a positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. The children were divided into 2 groups. A history, physical examination, anthropometric measurements, serum leptin levels, TNF-alpha levels, retinol and zinc levels were examined in all subjects before and after treatment. Nutritional supplementation and ATD were given to group I while ATD only were given to group II. The change in leptin, TNF-alpha, retinol and zinc levels were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test, while a t-test was used to determine changes in body mass index (BMI). Group I had a higher significant increase in serum leptin levels than group II (p=0.034). Group I had a significantly greater decrease in TNF-a levels than group II (p=0.032). No significant differences in retinol or zinc levels were seen between the two, but both groups had an increase after treatment. Both groups had a significant increase in BMI (p=<0.001) post-treatment compared to pre-treatment. Supplementation with zinc, vitamin A and fish oil is associated with a significant increase in leptin levels and a significant decrease in TNF-alpha levels among children treated for TB. No significant benefit was seen in BMI among children receiving supplementation compared to those without it, although ATD resulted in a significant increase in BMI in both groups.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437320","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.782831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.705566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.680881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Retinol","weight":0.652514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.640631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.589497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.436774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.391329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Fish oil","weight":0.378737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_oil"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
