{"id":51679,"title":"Metabolic profile of the different phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome in two Latin American populations.","abstract":"To evaluate the metabolic profile of Chilean and Argentinian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to the Rotterdam criteria.Observational cross-sectional study.Academic centers.Women with PCOS, aged 18-39 years: 220 Chilean (PCOSCh) and 206 Argentinian (PCOSAr).Physical examination, fasting blood samples for androgens, gonadotropins, metabolic parameters, and a transvaginal ultrasound.Comparative analysis of the metabolic profile in both populations divided into four phenotypes.The distribution of the different phenotypes was different in both populations. PCOSCh women showed a higher body mass index and a higher percentage of metabolic syndrome in all phenotypes compared with the PCOSAr women. The PCOSAr women exhibited a statistically significantly higher diastolic blood pressure in phenotypes A, B, and C and a higher percentage of hypertension in phenotypes A and D compared with the PCOSCh women.The data show differences in the metabolic profile of both populations. PCOSCh women presented with greater metabolic alterations such as dysglycemia and dyslipidemia and a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, independent of the phenotype. The PCOSAr patients showed more elevated blood pressure. Ethnic diversity associated with environmental factors are fundamental elements in the analysis of the PCOS phenotypes.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666752","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.846453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.801145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.775082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.668283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.631704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.464617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.395062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Gynecologic ultrasonography","weight":0.141923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologic_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.111848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Classical element","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
