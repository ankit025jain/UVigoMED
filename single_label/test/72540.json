{"id":72540,"title":"[Popliteal cysts: etiologic and therapeutic approach].","abstract":"In children and adults, a popliteal cyst frequently coexists with an intra-articular disorder of the knee. Its mode of presentation consists of a palpable mass at the level of the popliteal fossa. The cyst is a recess of the synovial cavity of the knee, often associated to a chronic effusion. In children, the etiology may be primary with a development directly from the medial gastrocnemius-semimembranous bursa. In adults, it is usually secondary to degenerative or inflammatory disease of the knee. A communication between the intraarticular space and the cystic cavity can be often found. The aim of this study is to review epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis and treatment options.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964531","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.753081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.74294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.742775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.704589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Baker's cyst","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker's_cyst"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.330365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.281543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Popliteal fossa","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_fossa"},{"name":"Synovial bursa","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_bursa"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Popliteal artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
