{"id":53194,"title":"Benefits of caloric restriction for cardiometabolic health, including type 2 diabetes mellitus risk.","abstract":"In the United States, life expectancy has markedly increased during the past century, and population ageing is expected to double within the next 25?years. The process of ageing in a population is associated with the development of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, that can be prevented, and even reversed, with the implementation of healthy lifestyle interventions. The evidence to date, consolidated by the numerous epidemiological studies and clinical trials conducted, suggests that caloric restriction is an effective nutritional intervention for preventing most of these age-related conditions. At a metabolic level, caloric restriction with adequate nutrition has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce fasting glucose and insulin concentration and prevent obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and chronic inflammation. The purpose of this article is to review current knowledge of the metabolic and clinical implications of caloric restriction with adequate nutrition for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532291","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.852262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Calorie restriction","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.613833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.585621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.518382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.455396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Self care","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_care"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.218851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.143079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"}]}
