{"id":34817,"title":"(+)-Nootkatone inhibits tumor necrosis factor ?/interferon ?-induced production of chemokines in HaCaT cells.","abstract":"Chemokines are important mediators of cell migration, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) are well-known typical inflammatory chemokines involved in atopic dermatitis (AD). (+)-Nootkatone is the major component of Cyperus rotundus. (+)-Nootkatone has antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of (+)-nootkatone on tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?)/interferon ? (IFN-?)-induced expression of Th2 chemokines in HaCaT cells. We found that (+)-nootkatone inhibited the TNF-?/IFN-?-induced expression of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 mRNA in HaCaT cells. It also significantly inhibited TNF-?/IFN-?-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and protein kinase C? (PKC?). Furthermore, we showed that PKC? and p38 MAPK contributed to the inhibition of TNF-?/IFN-?-induced TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 expression by blocking I?B? degradation in HaCaT cells. Taken together, these results suggest that (+)-nootkatone may suppress TNF-?/IFN-?-induced TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 expression in HaCaT cells by inhibiting of PKC? and p38 MAPK signaling pathways that lead to activation of NF-?B. We propose that (+)-nootkatone may be a useful therapeutic candidate for inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.
