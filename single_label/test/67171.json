{"id":67171,"title":"Treating IgA nephropathy: quid novi?","abstract":"IgA nephropathy is a common autoimmune renal disease resulting in kidney failure for patients with significant proteinuria. The therapeutic options are limited including non-specific treatment to reduce proteinuria accomplished by renin-angiotensin blockade. Strategies to control intrarenal inflammation include the administration of fish oil and for severe disease the use of immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, glucocorticosteroids, and mycophenolate mofetil. In light of the limited option, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic intervention in patients with progressive disease. Herein, we review the evidence for existing treatment choices and explore new immunopharmacologic agents being investigated for IgA nephropathy.
