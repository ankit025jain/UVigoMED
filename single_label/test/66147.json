{"id":66147,"title":"Chromogranin A predicts outcome in prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone.","abstract":"In this retrospective study, we evaluated the chromogranin A (CgA) baseline value as a predictor of clinical outcome in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with abiraterone 1000 mg per day, whose disease progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy. In the 48 evaluable patients, serum CgA level was normal when <120 ?ng/ml (group A, n=16), within three times the upper normal value (UNV) when between 120 and 360 (group B, n=16), more than three times the UNV when ?360? ng/ml (group C, n=16). Decline in PSA level ?50% or more (PSA RR) was observed in 26 of 48 (54%) patients. PSA response rate did not correlate with the CgA groups. CgA levels more than three times the UNV predicted an early radiological progressive disease in eight of 11 cases (73%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) among the CgA groups A, B, and C was 9.2, 9.2, and 4.8 months respectively, P=0.0459. The median overall survival (OS) among the CgA groups was 19.0, 18.8, and 10.8 months respectively, P=0.2092. In the multivariate analysis, PSA RR (nonresponsive vs responsive) and CgA levels (group 3 vs groups 1+2) were predictors of PFS (P=0.0002 and P=0.0047 respectively), whereas PSA RR only was significantly associated with OS (P=0.0024), while CgA levels remained of borderline significance (P=0.0919). A serum CGA level more than three times the UNV predicted PFS and showed a trend vs OS prediction, independently from PSA response, in CRPC patients treated with abiraterone.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741024","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.487436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.442027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.254959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.226367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.149946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Abiraterone","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiraterone"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Color Graphics Adapter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Chromogranin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromogranin_A"},{"name":"Granin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granin"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"2090s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2090s"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Experience point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Joint probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Progressivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"United Nations Volunteers","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Volunteers"}]}
