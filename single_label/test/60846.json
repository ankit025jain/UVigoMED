{"id":60846,"title":"Solitary necrobiotic xanthogranuloma of an upper extremity in association with multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) is an uncommon granulomatous disorder of unknown pathogenesis that often presents with yellowish plaques in a periorbital distribution. While a majority of cases are associated with an underlying paraproteinemia of the IgG kappa type, a much smaller number are found to be associated with an underlying multiple myeloma. We present a case of a 78-year-old male with an isolated lesion of NXG on his right upper extremity. Following his diagnosis of NXG, further investigation for underlying systemic disorders with serum immunofixation revealed a monoclonal IgG kappa immunoglobulin with an M-spike of 1.2 g/dL. A PET-CT demonstrated bone destruction in the left proximal fifth rib, left scapula, the anterior lumbar I (L1) vertebrae, the left lumbar III (L3) vertebrae posterior elements and possibly left sacrum. A bone marrow biopsy revealed 18 % plasma cells. With these findings he was diagnosed with stage I multiple myeloma. Though clinically unimpressive and atypical in location for NXG, early biopsy and diagnosis of this solitary lesion led to the discovery of his hematopoietic disorder.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809886","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.789102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Scapula","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.717091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.705405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.327954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.299254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.198784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.168131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Paraproteinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraproteinemia"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
