{"id":14891,"title":"Mouse glioma immunotherapy mediated by A2B5+ GL261 cell lysate-pulsed dendritic cells.","abstract":"Immunotherapy strategies targeting glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) hold promise for improving outcomes in glioblastoma patients. We used the A2B5 monoclonal antibody to classify GSCs derived from the mouse GL261 glioma cell line, and A2B5+ GL261 cell lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) were used to treat mouse glioma. We found that such DCs elicited a stronger specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against A2B5+ GL261 cells than A2B5- GL261 cell lysate-pulsed DCs. The effect of A2B5+ GL261 cell lysate-pulsed DCs in vivo depended on when the vaccination was started. In the tumor cell adaptation phase, C57BL/6 mice had an immune response against GL261, and vaccination enhanced the immune response and prevented glioma formation in 37.5% of mice. In contrast, after glioma formation, the immune response against GL261 was decreased, and vaccination had no therapeutic effect. Our findings suggest that vaccination with A2B5+ GL261 cell lysate-pulsed DCs only has some glioma preventive effect.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398615","annotations":[{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.874471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.281543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
