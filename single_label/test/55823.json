{"id":55823,"title":"[Allergic contact eczema].","abstract":"Allergic contact eczema due to type IV reactions are more frequent than irritative eczema in facial skin, particularly in the sensitive periorbital region. Concomitant eczema of different locations is pathognomonic and allows a distinction from seborrhoic dermatitis. Avoidance of allergen exposure is mandatory for an effective treatment; therefore allergological examinations have a very high significance. Patch tests with a wide spectrum of potential allergens have to be included in these tests. Therapeutic regimes include a restrictive use of topical steroids. Substances like calcineurin inhibitors are the first-line therapy in facial atopic dermatitis, in spite of therapeutic effects, they have not yet been approved for other forms of periorbital dermatitis.
