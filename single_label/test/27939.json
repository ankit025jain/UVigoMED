{"id":27939,"title":"Effects of hydroxocobalamin on carboxyhemoglobin measured under physiologic and pathologic conditions.","abstract":"Pre-hospital administration of hydroxocobalamin (B12a) is used for empiric treatment of cyanide poisoning because cyanide poisoning is difficult to identify and requires immediate treatment. B12a interferes with the accuracy of several blood laboratory tests. This study aimed to explore how B12a affects carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) measurements in human blood at both physiologic and pathologic COHb levels.Several clinically relevant concentrations of B12a were added to human blood samples containing physiologic (? 3%) and pathologic (30% and 50%) COHb levels. We then measured the COHb levels of the samples using two different co-oximeters, the Radiometer ABL 700 and the Rapidpoint 500, and compared to their actual baseline COHb levels.B12a had minimal effects on the COHb measured at both physiologic and pathologic levels when measured on the Radiometer. In contrast, the Rapidpoint B12a caused a dose-dependent decrease in the COHb measured, especially of pathologic COHb levels (? 30 and 50%).The magnitude of B12a interference on measured COHb is dependent upon the specific co-oximeter used, the actual COHb level and the serum B12a concentration. These errors may potentially influence clinical decision making and thus affect patient outcomes. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring COHb levels on blood samples collected prior to B12a administration.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25089720","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.552959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cyanide","weight":0.226227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.204851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Carboxyhemoglobin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxyhemoglobin"},{"name":"Empiric therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiric_therapy"},{"name":"Hydroxocobalamin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxocobalamin"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Cyanide poisoning","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Magnitude (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Radiometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometer"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"British Board of Film Classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"}]}
