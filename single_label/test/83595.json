{"id":83595,"title":"Robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse.","abstract":"The demand for surgical correction of pelvic organ prolapse is expected to grow as the aging population remains active and focused on quality of life. Definitive correction of pelvic organ prolapse can be accomplished through both vaginal and abdominal approaches. This article provides a contemporary reference source that specifically addresses the historical framework, diagnostic algorithm, and therapeutic options for the treatment of female pelvic organ prolapse. Particular emphasis is placed on the role and technique of abdominal-based reconstruction using robotic technology and the evolving controversy regarding the use of synthetic vaginal mesh.
