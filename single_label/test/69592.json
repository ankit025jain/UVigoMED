{"id":69592,"title":"Recurrent renal allograft dysfunction due to ureteric stenosis in a patient with the BK virus infection.","abstract":"Diseases of the genitourinary tract in association with the BK virus (BKV) infection are increasing among renal allograft recipients. We herewith report a young, female renal transplant recipient who presented with allograft dysfunction secondary to proximal ureteric stenosis. The allograft function improved dramatically after correction and stenting of the stenosis. Our case suggests that screening for BKV infection should be an integral part of evaluation of allograft dysfunction.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434390","annotations":[{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.719996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.441381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"BK virus","weight":0.187395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK_virus"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"BKV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BKV"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
