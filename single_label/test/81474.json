{"id":81474,"title":"Repair of a multiple implant-supported fixed superstructure with a metal-ceramic resin-bonded fixed partial denture: a clinical report.","abstract":"Even in the case of implant loss, replacement of the implant and refabrication of the superstructure are often sufficient, as long as the bone and soft tissue are in good condition. However, if implant loss accompanied by serious bone resorption occurs with a fixed implant superstructure supported by multiple implants, it is very difficult to treat. This clinical report describes the process by which multiple implant-supported fixed metal ceramic restorations were repaired with a metal ceramic resin-bonded fixed partial denture without complete refabrication after removal of one of the implants due to severe bone resorption. The 3-year follow-up indicated excellent serviceability and a well-satisfied patient.
