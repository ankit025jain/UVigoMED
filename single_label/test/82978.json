{"id":82978,"title":"Tooth bleaching induces changes in the vascular permeability of rat incisor pulps.","abstract":"To evaluate the inflammatory response in dental pulps of rat incisors subjected to tooth bleaching protocols with different HP concentrations and application times.42 incisors from Wistar rats were submitted to tooth bleaching using concentrations of 25% or 35% HP for treatment times of 15, 30 or 45 minutes. Four non-bleached teeth were used as controls. The animals received an intravenous injection of India ink immediately after the bleaching procedure and were sacrificed 1 hour later. Six bleached teeth from each group and three controls were made transparent, and one sample from each group was processed for histological analysis. The data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal Wallis and Dunn's tests (P < 0.05).The amount of dental pulp ink content was significantly higher in the samples that were bleached with 35% HP for 30 minutes and with both HP concentrations (25 and 35%) for 45 minutes than in the controls. For the samples bleached with the same HP concentration, the ink content was higher in samples that were bleached for 45 minutes. These results indicate that HP tooth bleaching can induce an increase in vascular permeability in rat incisors. Importantly, this increase is more dependent on the length of the bleaching procedure than on the concentration of the bleaching agent.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479284","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"India","weight":0.768143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.686205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.538457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.527953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.347706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.209971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Tooth bleaching","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_bleaching"},{"name":"India ink","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_ink"},{"name":"Vascular permeability","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_permeability"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleach","weight":0.0598746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.0450952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"}]}
