{"id":91158,"title":"Double-lung point sign in traumatic pneumothorax.","abstract":"Lung ultrasound has emerged as a rapid and accurate screening tool for pneumothorax. The lung point sign, a sonographic representation of the point on the chest wall where the pleural layers re-adhere, is 100% specific to confirm the diagnosis. Double lung point sign for a single pneumothorax is extremely unusual and has only been reported twice in the literature. A 49-year-old woman was transported to the emergency department (ED) intubated and sedated with severe head injury. She remained hemodynamically stable without respiratory compromise throughout her ED course. Chest computed tomography was notable for an anterior left pneumothorax with underlying pulmonary contusion. Bedside ultrasound of this region revealed a double lung point sign. Our case report is the first to confirm association of the double lung point sign with a single pneumothorax on corresponding computed tomographic imaging.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534193","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary contusion","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_contusion"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.849338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.583813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.4405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.212894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.110315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Tomographic reconstruction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomographic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
