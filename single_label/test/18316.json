{"id":18316,"title":"Incidence and risk factors for and the effect of a program to reduce the incidence of surgical site infection after cardiac surgery.","abstract":"Surgical site infection (SSI) after cardiac surgery (CS) is a serious complication that increases hospital length of stay (LOS), has a substantial financial impact, and increases mortality. The study described here was done to evaluate the effect of a program to reduce SSI after CS.In January 2007, a multi-disciplinary CS infection-prevention team developed guidelines and implemented bundled tactics for reducing SSI. Data for all patients who underwent CS from 2006-2008 were used to determine whether there was: 1) A difference in the incidence of SSI in white patients and those belonging to minority groups; 2) a reduction in SSI after intervention; and 3) a statistically significant difference in the incidence of SSI in the third quarter of each year as compared with the other quarters of the year.Of 3,418 patients who underwent CS; 1,125 (32.9%) were members of minority groups and 2,293 (67.1%) were white. Eighty (2.3%) patients developed SSI. There was no significant difference in the incidence of SSI in non-Hispanic white patients and all others (2.1% vs. 2.8%, p=0. 42). The incidence of SSI decreased significantly from 2006 (3.0%) to 2007 (2.5%) and 2008 (1.4%), (p=0.03). Surgical site infection occurred more often in the third quarter of each of the years of the study than in other quarters of each year (3.3 vs. 2.0%, p=0.038).Implementation of a program to reduce SSI after CS was associated with a lower incidence of SSI across all racial and ethnic groups and over time, but was not associated with a lower incidence of SSI in the third quarter of each year than in the other quarters.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800982","annotations":[{"name":"Death","weight":0.771817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.576261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.399516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.120805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"American football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Simulations,_Inc."},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Product bundling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
