{"id":55521,"title":"[Modern endothelial keratoplasty-based options for visual rehabilitation of patients with bullous keratopathy and concomitant glaucoma].","abstract":"To develop endothelial keratoplasty-based surgical treatment and management policy for patients with bullous keratopathy complicated by glaucoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS; A total of 41 patients (41 eyes) with bullous keratopathy and concomitant II-III stage glaucoma were enrolled. All patients underwent endothelial keratoplasty of different modification--DSAEK, utDSAEK, DMAEK. Two types of glaucoma drainage surgery were applied--intrascleral amniotic drainage and implantation of a domestically manufactured silicone tubular drainage wrapped in amnion.Intraocular pressure (IOP) was compensated in 11 of 12 patients, on whom a glaucoma procedure was performed. In 29 post-keratoplasty patients, whose IOP was compensated both before and after the surgery, the mean IOP at the 2-year follow-up visit was 2 mm Hg higher than the preoperative values. Medication regimen was adjusted in 7 cases in order to enhance the hypotensive effect. No evident correlation between graft thickness and IOP change was found.Based on a study of 41 patients (41 eyes) with bullous keratopathy and concomitant glaucoma who underwent endothelial keratoplasty, surgical treatment and therapeutic management policy is developed, which takes into account whether or not the IOP is compensated and whether or not its further decrease is required and implies the use of own original drainage techniques.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864496","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.767009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.514707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.438274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.423006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.41598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.308315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.266487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Amnion","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnion"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Glaucoma surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma_surgery"},{"name":"Bullous keratopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullous_keratopathy"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
