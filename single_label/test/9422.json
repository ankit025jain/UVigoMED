{"id":9422,"title":"Relative vitamin A values of 9-cis- and 13-cis-?-carotene do not differ when fed at physiological levels during vitamin A depletion in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus).","abstract":"Provitamin A biofortification of staple crops may decrease the prevalence of vitamin A (VA) deficiency if widely adopted in target countries. To assess the impact of processing methods on the VA value of plant foods, the unique bioefficacies of cis-?C isomers (formed during cooking) compared with all-trans (at) ?-carotene (?C) must be determined. The bioefficacies of 9-cis (9c)- and 13-cis (13c)-?C isomers were compared with those of the at-?C isomer and VA positive (VA+) and negative (VA - ) controls in VA-depleted Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) in two experimental studies (study 1, n 56; study 2, n 57). A 3- or 4-week depletion period was followed by a 3- or 4-week treatment period in which the groups received oral doses of the 9c-, 13c- or at-?C isomers in cottonseed oil (study 1, 15 nmol/d; study 2, 30 nmol/d). In study 1, the ?C isomers did not maintain baseline liver VA stores in all groups (0.69 (SD 0.20) ?mol/liver) except in the VA+group (0.56 (SD 0.10) ?mol/liver) (P= 0.0026). The ?C groups were similar to the VA+group, but the 9c- and 13c-?C groups did not differ from the VA - group (0.39 (SD 0.09) ?mol/liver). In study 2, the ?C isomers maintained baseline liver VA stores in all the ?C groups (0.35 (SD 0.13) ?mol/liver), and in the VA+group, the VA supplement (0.54 (SD 0.19) ?mol/liver) exceeded the baseline VA status (0.38 (SD 0.15) ?mol/liver) (P< 0.0001); however, the 9c-?C group did not differ from the VA - group (0.20 (SD 0.07) ?mol/liver). In vivo isomerisation of ?C was confirmed in both experimental studies. Lower VA bioconversion factor values were obtained for the cis-?C isomers in study 2 when compared with study 1, but higher values were obtained for the at-?C isomer. Dose and VA status clearly affect bioconversion factors. In conclusion, the cis-?C isomers yielded similar liver VA stores to the at-?C isomer in Mongolian gerbils, and liver VA stores of the 9c- and 13c-?C groups did not differ when the doses were provided at physiological levels over time in two studies.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709067","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.865861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.707053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Isomer","weight":0.512904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomer"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Cotton","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton"},{"name":"Carotene","weight":0.453394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotene"},{"name":"Cottonseed oil","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonseed_oil"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.326489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Cooking","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Staple food","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food"},{"name":"Crop","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.224431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.214399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cis-trans isomerism","weight":0.104051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis-trans_isomerism"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0544569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Isomerisation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomerisation"},{"name":"Mongolian gerbil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_gerbil"},{"name":"Bioconversion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioconversion"},{"name":"Meriones (genus)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriones_(genus)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Gerbil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbil"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mongolia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"},{"name":"Vegetarian nutrition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_nutrition"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_3"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
