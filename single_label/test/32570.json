{"id":32570,"title":"The impact of psycho-educational training on the psychosocial adjustment of caregivers of osteogenesis imperfecta patients.","abstract":"To investigate the impact of a psycho-educational program developed for the caregivers of patients diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).The participants consisted of 16 caregivers. The study was designed as a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test type study consisting of 10 semi-structured three-hour training sessions. The data were collected using the \"Introductory Information Form\" and appropriate scales (Burden Interview, Coping Strategies Scale, Problem-Solving Inventory and Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale). The results were evaluated by descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, one-way variance analysis and Bonferroni analysis.Psychosocial adjustment levels of the caregivers of OI patients before their participation in the educational program were found to be associated with styles of coping with stress, problem-solving skills and care burden. After the psycho-educational training, the majority of the participants reported favorable changes in their lives. Following the offered psycho-education resulted in positive changes in the mean scores of the caregivers (p<0.05).Before the education program, the participants were not able to deal efficiently with many aspects of their caregiver responsibilities and suffered from an emotional burden due to lack of knowledge. The program appears to have provided them both with support to achieve significant psychosocial transformation and with an opportunity to reconsider their lives in multiple dimensions.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24932601","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.578432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.14466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Psychoeducation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoeducation"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Data type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type"},{"name":"Canonical correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation"},{"name":"Integral transform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform"},{"name":"Carlo Emilio Bonferroni","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Bonferroni"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Oi (telecommunications)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oi_(telecommunications)"},{"name":"N-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Music genre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre"},{"name":"Variance (accounting)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_(accounting)"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Burden, Kansas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden,_Kansas"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Psychoeducational","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoeducational"}]}
