{"id":66289,"title":"Practice patterns of urologists in managing Korean men aged 40 years or younger with high serum prostate-specific antigen levels.","abstract":"To investigate the practice patterns of urologists in managing Korean men aged 40 years or younger with high serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).Data were collected from general health screenings conducted at 4 university hospitals between 2004 and 2012. Eligibility criteria were Korean men aged?40 years who were seen by urologists for high PSA (>2.5 ng/mL). After excluding individuals with chronic prostatitis and any infectious symptoms and/or signs, the practice patterns of urologists managing 237 eligible men were analyzed.The most common practice was observation after antibiotics (40.5%), followed by reassurance (38.4%), prostate biopsy (PBx) after antibiotics (11.8%), PBx after PSA follow-up (7.6%), and immediate PBx (1.7%). Antibiotics were prescribed empirically to 124 patients (52.3%). Of the entire patients, 145 of 237 (61.2%) had at least 1 follow-up PSA, and the follow-up PSA with median interval of 43 days (interquartile range, 26-149) was higher than initial PSA in 66 of 145 (45.5%). Of the 98 patients undergoing follow-up PSA after initial antibiotic treatment, 53 (54.1%) experienced a decline in PSA, whereas 45 (45.9%) experienced a rise in PSA. PBx was performed in 50 of 237 (21.1%), and only a single case (2%) of prostate cancer was diagnosed.In managing men?40 years with high PSA, the most common practice pattern was observation after antibiotic treatment despite lack of evidences. Furthermore, 1 in 5 urologists performed PBx to rule out cancer. Given the very low prevalence of cancer in this age group, clear guidelines are needed for appropriate management and consistency of care.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726151","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.688474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.657355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.498102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"University","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.110579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Koreans","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans"},{"name":"Common practice period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_practice_period"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Chronic bacterial prostatitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bacterial_prostatitis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
