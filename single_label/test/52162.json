{"id":52162,"title":"Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers using Mepilex Lite Dressings: a pilot study.","abstract":"5-10% diabetes patients will develop diabetic foot ulceration at some time during the life. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Mepilex Lite dressings and vaseline gauze care in the healing of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.This was a randomized controlled trial, and a sample of 50 diabetic patients who had developed foot ulcers was assessed. Comparisons were made regarding parameters related to wound healing, including healing time and wound pain, and also regarding the adverse events.The results showed that foot ulcers in the study group (Mepilex Lite, 24 patients) healed in a median of 49.9 days, which was significantly different from the healing time in the control group (median, 65.5 days, 26 patients; P=0.038). No statistically significant differences were detected between the 2 groups with pain. However, Mepilex Lite dressings significantly reduced wound area (P<0.05).The researchers conclude that Mepilex Lite dressing provides a promising alternative to diabetic foot ulcers and is worthy of further research.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623502","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.443292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.388258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.376921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.237159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.214423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Petroleum jelly","weight":0.0382772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_jelly"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0369874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Salad dressing","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_dressing"},{"name":"Gauze","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauze"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Diet food","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_food"}]}
