{"id":37916,"title":"[Clinical importance of preoperative measurement of plasma amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in infants with congenital heart disease].","abstract":"To define cut-off values of plasma amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) for the diagnosis of congenital heart failure (CHF) and evaluate the importance of plasma NT-ProBNP measurement in the assessment of cardiac function prior to heart surgery in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD).Plasma levels of NT-proBNP were measured in 120 infants with CHD before heart surgery and in 100 age-matched healthy infants between June 2010 and June 2013. The data were stratified based on the presence or absence of CHF in the whole group of CHD infants and on age (i.e., <1 year and ?1 year) and time (i.e., before surgery) within the subgroup of CHF infants.Of the 120 infants with CHD, 41 met the criteria for CHF defined in the Ross Classification for Heart Failure in Infants.The cut-off values of plasma NT-ProBNP were ?498?ng/L for infants of all ages, 557?ng/L for <1 year age group and 452?ng/L for ?1 year age group, respectively, in the 41 CHF patients. In CHF infants, plasma NT-proBNP was significantly decreased after protecting of cardiac function (P<0.001).The cut-off values of plasma NT-ProBNP for CHF differ between infants <1 year and infants ?1 year. Moreover, plasma NT-ProBNP can be used as an additional parameter in the preoperative assessment of cardiac function in CHD infants.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461176","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.810495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.737012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.679652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
