{"id":46692,"title":"Decorin prevents the development of CCl?-induced liver fibrosis in mice.","abstract":"Liver fibrosis normally progresses to cirrhosis and destroys the normal architecture of the liver, resulting in liver dysfunction and irreversible cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-fibrosis effect and the possible underlying mechanisms of decorin.The mice model of liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 50% (v/v) of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) diluted in olive oil (1 ml/kg body weight) once every 2 days for 5 weeks. Three weeks after injecting CCl4 intraperitoneally, mice were randomly divided into normal control with vehicles only (olive oil), mouse model given CCl4 only, and CCl4 plus decorin (DCN, 250 Âµg/kg). Two weeks later, all the mice were sacrificed and their liver tissues were analyzed for the expressions of genes related to liver fibrosis and under hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemical staining of all groups. Aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and total bilirubin of the serum were determined for evaluation of the liver function.Exogenous protein decorin could reduce liver fibrosis induced by CCl4 in mice. The degree of fibrosis in the experimental group was alleviated, and the contents of collagen fibers were lower in the experimental group than those of the control group. In addition, expressions of transforming growth factor ?1 and ?-smooth muscle actin decreased in the experimental group.Taking liver fibrosis model of mouse as the experimental target and by injecting exogenous protein decorin into the model, we confirmed that decorin could inhibit the expression of proteins related to fibrosis and reduce the formation of liver fibrosis in mice.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622442","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon
