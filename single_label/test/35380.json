{"id":35380,"title":"Dystroglycanopathy with two novel POMT1 mutations in a Chinese boy with developmental delay and muscular dystrophy.","abstract":"Alpha-dystroglycanopathies are a group of diseases due to reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, which commonly result from mutations in POMT1, POMT2, and POMGnT1. Patients with alpha-dystroglycanopathies present with muscular, cerebral, and ocular involvements with differing severities. We reported a boy who presented with muscular dystrophy, developmental delay, and non-specific white matter lesions. Mutation analysis of POMT1 was performed and revealed two novel mutations, a substitution mutation (c.176T>G) and a duplication mutation (c.2059dupC) which results in premature termination of translation. In-silico prediction in five different platforms concurred that the substitution is damaging, and functional studies by immunofluorescence revealed lack of staining in the carbohydrate moiety of alpha-dystroglycan, confirming the molecular findings in a functional manner. In conclusion, we reported the first case of genetically confirmed alpha-dystroglycanopathy due to mutations in POMT1 in Chinese.
