{"id":43653,"title":"A curious case of spontaneous duodenal haematoma presenting a diagnostic challenge.","abstract":"Duodenal haematomas are uncommon. They are usually diagnosed on CT of the abdomen. The established treatment strategies are conservative management, surgical evacuation and percutaneous drainage. We present a case of spontaneous duodenal haematoma in a patient with no risk factors posing as a diagnostic challenge due to atypical CT findings. This case also illustrates the utility of ultrasound-guided needle aspiration as a practical treatment option for such haematomas.
