{"id":56372,"title":"Early detection of recurrent primary iris stromal cyst using ultrasound biomicroscopy.","abstract":"Primary iris stromal cyst characteristically presents as a smooth, round, translucent mass in the anterior chamber. In small children it tends to grow rapidly and may be confused with intraocular malignancy. Management is difficult, and recurrences are frequent. We report 2 cases of primary iris stromal cyst in which recurrence was detected relatively early using ultrasound biomicroscopy and successfully managed with iridectomy.
