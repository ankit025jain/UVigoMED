{"id":65373,"title":"Nanoways to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.","abstract":"Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in American men. Docetaxel is a useful chemotherapeutic agent for prostate cancer that has been available for over a decade, but the length of the treatment and systemic side effects hamper compliance. Additionally, docetaxel resistance invariably emerges, leading to disease relapse. Docetaxel resistance is either intrinsic or acquired by adopting various mechanisms that are highly associated with genetic alterations, decreased influx and increased efflux of drugs. Several combination therapies and small P-glycoprotein inhibitors have been proposed to improve the therapeutic potential of docetaxel in prostate cancer. Novel therapeutic strategies that may allow reversal of docetaxel resistance include alterations of enzymes, improving drug uptake and enhancement of apoptosis. In this review, we provide the most current docetaxel reversal approaches utilizing nanotechnology. Nanotechnology mediated docetaxel delivery is superior to existing therapeutic strategies and a more effective method to induce P-glycoprotein inhibition, enhance cellular uptake, maintain sustained drug release, and improve bioavailability.
