{"id":89102,"title":"[Value of MRI in the diagnosis of radial head fracture with forearm interosseous membrane injury].","abstract":"To investigate the diagnostic value of MRI in radial head fracture with forearm interosseous membrane injuries.From December 2011 to December 2012,26 patients with fractures of capitulum radial in our hospital were collected. There were 15 males and 11 females, ranging in age from 21 to 53 years old,with an average of 37.6 years old. All the patients visited hospital within 72 hours after injuries. X-ray radiography of full ulnar radial length in injured side, CT in injured side (three-dimensional reconstruction if necessary) and MRI (including the elbow and wrist joints) were performed within a week after the injury. The MRI manifestations of the forearm interosseous membrane (with or without damage, the injured location and the injury degree ) and the fractures degree of radial head were observed and compared for the relativity.Radial head fracture from Mason type I to III was associated with the forearm interosseous membrane injury. Radial head fracture degree was positive correlated with forearm interosseous membrane injury degree (P < 0.05).Radial head fracture with suspicious forearm interosseous membrane injury is necessary to take MRI for checking for any interosseous membrane injury and injury degree, then choose the right treatment for radial capitulum fracture, only in this way can be helpful for the functional recovery of elbow and forearm.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754154","annotations":[{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.661557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.630946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.621298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.526482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.423591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Head of radius","weight":0.345979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_radius"},{"name":"Interosseous membrane","weight":0.34211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interosseous_membrane"},{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.338568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.240812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Capitulum of the humerus","weight":0.148746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitulum_of_the_humerus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0317028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Theory of relativity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Interosseous sacroiliac ligament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interosseous_sacroiliac_ligament"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
