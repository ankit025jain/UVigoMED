{"id":27143,"title":"[Adaptative resources of the main regulatory systems in patients with hypertension under the highland conditions].","abstract":"To study characteristics of hemodynamics, spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and their association with the total blood concentration of stable metabolites of nitric oxide (nitrites and nitrates) in patients with hypertension living in highlands.110 natives of the highlands of Elbrus region were examined. All of them were divided into 2 groups--with 2d stage of hypertension (n = 50) and conditionally healthy (n = 60. All the participants were performed routine examination under the conditions of hospitals and out-patient clinics. Moreover they were performed ECG, rhythm-cardiography, echo-CG evaluation of the blood pressure, renal and thyroid ultrasound and eye-ground examination. The assessment of HRV was made.In the group of patients with hypertension there was decrease in the total power of HRV - TP, low frequency range--VLF, LF and high frequency range HF. The main characteristics of the central and intracardiac hemodynamics were significantly higher in patients with hypertension in decreasing of nitric oxide production.Reverse reliable correlations were established between low frequency values of HRV, morpho-functional characteristics of the left ventricle and blood concentration of nitric oxide in patients with hypertension.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055557","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric
