{"id":19222,"title":"Total internal reflection (TIRF)-based quantification of procalcitonin for sepsis diagnosis--a point-of-care testing application.","abstract":"A new, highly sensitive fluorescence immunoassay for a TIRF (total internal reflection)-based point-of-care testing (POCT) device was developed for the detection of procalcitonin (PCT), a specific and early marker for sepsis and microbial infections. The immunoassay was performed on a bench-top system that fulfilled all the necessary characteristics of a POCT application, including a short measurement time (<9 min), no sample pre-treatment requirements and application directly near patients. New rat monoclonal antibodies targeting PCT were screened and characterized. The best combinations of antibodies were then integrated into single-use cartridges, and the reduction of nonspecific binding was achieved by supplying suitable additives. Moreover, human recombinant PCT (hrPCT) for use as a standard was developed in the native form of hPCT in plasma (PCT1-116, PCT3-116). The assay achieves the required sensitivity range in human plasma to allow reliable differentiation between healthy persons and varying stages of infection severity (LOD=0.04 ng/mL; LOQ=0.12 ng/mL). Furthermore, the developed PCT assay can be applied in whole human blood with an adequate sensitivity (LOD=0.02 ng/mL; LOQ=0.09 ng/mL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diagnostic test for sepsis to use whole blood, which is a crucial requirement for POCT. We were able to detect native PCT in patient samples and showed a good correlation (R(2)=0.988) with the results of the Kryptor(Â®) device from BRAHMS, a state of the art device for the detection of PCT.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732603","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.694493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.625063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.552484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.414288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.215191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.0380956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Point-of-care testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-care_testing"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"State of the art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Integrase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"}]}
