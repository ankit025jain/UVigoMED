{"id":53321,"title":"Quantitative imaging of serotonergic biosynthesis and degradation in the endocrine pancreas.","abstract":"Serotonergic biosynthesis in the endocrine pancreas, of which the islets of Langerhans is the major constituent, has been implicated in insulin release and ? cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of quantitative noninvasive imaging of the serotonergic metabolism in the pancreas using the PET tracer (11)C-5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan ((11)C-5-HTP).Uptake of (11)C-5-HTP, and its specificity for key enzymes in the serotonergic metabolic pathway, was assessed in vitro (INS-1 and PANC1 cells and human islet and exocrine preparations) and in vivo (nonhuman primates and healthy and diabetic rats).In vitro tracer uptake in endocrine cells (INS-1 and human islets), but not PANC1 and exocrine cells, was mediated specifically by intracellular conversion into serotonin. Pancreatic uptake of (11)C-5-HTP in nonhuman primates was markedly decreased by inhibition of the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, which converts (11)C-5-HTP to (11)C-serotonin and increased after inhibition of monoamine oxidase-A, the main enzyme responsible for serotonin degradation. Uptake in the rat pancreas was similarly modulated by inhibition of monoamine oxidase-A and was reduced in animals with induced diabetes.The PET tracer (11)C-5-HTP can be used for quantitative imaging of the serotonergic system in the endocrine pancreas.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525204","annotations":[{"name":"5-Hydroxytryptophan","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase","weight":0.829665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Serotonergic","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonergic"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Monoamine neurotransmitter","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.58699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.460642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Exocrine gland","weight":0.408194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.322361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Langerhans cell","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
