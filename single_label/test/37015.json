{"id":37015,"title":"Differential diagnosis of abdominal wall defects - omphalocele versus gastroschisis.","abstract":"A newborn with abdominal wall defect is one of the most dramatic cases in neonatology, but also a challenge for pediatric surgeons. This article describes the fundamental concepts of two major abdominal wall defects - gastroschisis and omphalocele - including options and principles of prenatal and postnatal care. Although these birth defects of the abdominal wall are always grouped together, they are two separate and distinct entities, with many differences in terms of pathology and associated anomalies; this explains the different therapeutic approach and results. For a correct management of the newborn with this anomaly, it is essential to understand the similarities and differences between gastroschisis and omphalocele. This article emphasises the similarities between these two parietal defects, highlighting the differences as well.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524464","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.810658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.751207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.730257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.366993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Gastroschisis","weight":0.32165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroschisis"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.250141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.211358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Abdominal wall defect","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall_defect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Omphalocele","weight":0.0722222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalocele"},{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"}]}
