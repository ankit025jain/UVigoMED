{"id":88066,"title":"Patient perceptions on physician reimbursement in plastic surgery.","abstract":"Public perception on physician reimbursement may be that considerable payments are received for procedures: a direct contrast to the actual decline. We aim to investigate patient perceptions toward plastic surgeon reimbursements from insurance companies.A survey of 4 common, single-staged procedures was administered to 140 patients. Patients were asked for their opinion on current insurance company reimbursement fees and what they believed the reimbursement fee should be.Eighty-four patients completed the survey. Patients estimated physician's reimbursements at 472% to 1061% more for breast reduction, 347% to 770% for abdominal hernia reconstruction, 372% to 787% for panniculectomy, and 290% to 628% for mandibular fracture repair. Despite these perceived higher-than-actual-fee payments, 87% of patients thought reimbursements should still be higher.Patients surveyed overestimated plastic surgery procedure fees by 290% to 1061%. Patients should be informed and educated regarding current fee schedules to plastic surgeons to correct current misconceptions.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918737","annotations":[{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Breast reduction","weight":0.735401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reduction"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.678393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.387482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.344038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0598746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"628","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/628"},{"name":"1061","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1061"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Company (military unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Fee","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Reimbursement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reimbursement"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
