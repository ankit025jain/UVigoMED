{"id":65775,"title":"Conservative management of renal artery pseudoaneurysm following partial nephrectomy.","abstract":"A bleeding renal artery pseudoaneurysm is a recognised complication occurring after partial nephrectomy. The bleeding is usually suspected when a patient presents with haematuria following the procedure and the reported management is with radiologically guided embolisation. We report a case of renal artery pseudoaneurysm successfully managed conservatively, giving another potential management option in non-torrential haemorrhage.
