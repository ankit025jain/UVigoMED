{"id":77016,"title":"Changes in serum copper and zinc levels in peripartum healthy and subclinically hypocalcemic dairy cows.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the levels of serum copper and zinc in subclinically hypocalcemic peripartum dairy cows in comparison to healthy animals. Blood samples were taken from 219 multiparous Holstein cows near parturition (from 4 weeks prepartum to 4 weeks postpartum) and 51 cows with subclinical hypocalcemia. The results showed that the serum copper concentration increased gradually at 1 week prepartum and remained high for the first 4 weeks postpartum in the healthy periparturient dairy cows. The serum zinc concentration reached a nadir at 1 week postpartum and subsequently increased gradually to baseline. The serum zinc concentration was significantly decreased (P<0.01) in dairy cows with subclinical hypocalcemia compared with healthy cows. There was no significant difference in the serum copper concentration between cows with subclinical hypocalcemia and healthy cows. These data demonstrate that the concentrations of copper and zinc in serum change dramatically during the peripartum period in dairy cows, which is a tremendous challenge for the body and for the maintenance of dairy cow health. The present study further suggests that a decreased serum zinc concentration could be a cause of decreased productive performance and increased susceptibility to other diseases due to immunosuppression in dairy cows with subclinical hypocalcemia. Additionally, this decreased zinc concentration may be involved in the pathogenesis of subclinical hypocalcemia.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859816","annotations":[{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.858353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.705566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.469821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.431093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.337453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.300013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Hypocalcaemia","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcaemia"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.168492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dairy cattle","weight":0.152691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0861791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/219"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Holstein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Holstein cattle","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein_cattle"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
