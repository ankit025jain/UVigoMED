{"id":19289,"title":"Identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria in patients with suspected sepsis by multiplex PCR.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanii have been found to be the most prevalent bacteremia-causing bacteria in patients with septicemia. Early detection of bloodstream infection (BSI) is crucial in the clinical setting. A multiplex PCR method for identification of these agents in clinical samples has been developed in parallel by conventional microbiological methods.The target genes selected for each of the organisms were very specific for designing primers. Design of primers was done using Mega4, Allel ID6, Oligo6, and Oligo analyzer software. The test comprises a universal PCR from the 16S rDNA gene and multiplex PCR from the rpoB, gyrA, sss, and chromosome X (as an internal control).The sensitivity and specificity for universal PCR and multiplex PCR in comparison with BC were 83.87% and 91.58%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) for these two PCRs were 76.47% and 94.57%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. PCR failed to identify bacteria which were found conventionally in only 3.96% and 6.34% of the cases by universal and multiplex PCR (mostly bacteria not included in the PCR cassette). In 6.34% of the cases, multiplex PCR afforded identification of bacteria, but BC showed no bacteria in the sample.The multiplex PCR approach facilitates the detection of bacteremia in blood samples within a few hours. Rapid detection of bacteria by multiplex PCR appears to be a valuable tool, allowing earlier pathogen-adopted antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
