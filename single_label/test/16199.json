{"id":16199,"title":"[Oflomelid ointment: activity against hospital microbial strains].","abstract":"Ofloxacin susceptibility was tested with the use of 100 hospital isolates by the disk diffusion method vs. the activity of Oflomelid ointment tested by the cavity method. It was shown that the hospital isolates of all the species were susceptible to the Oflomelid ointment, while susceptibility to ofloxacin was preserved in S. epidermidis, the susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp., E. coli, Proteus spp. being intermediate. Such a difference in the susceptibility of the isolates was evidently due to the properties of polyethylene glycols in the ointment composition.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051711","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.59745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Staphylococcus epidermidis","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_epidermidis"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.119397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Proteus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Ofloxacin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofloxacin"},{"name":"Cavity method","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavity_method"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"}]}
