{"id":62849,"title":"Post-varicella-zoster virus granulomatous dermatitis: a report of 2 cases.","abstract":"Granulomatous dermatitis (GD) is known to occur following varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. Lesions may appear at varying times after the acute eruption in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent hosts. The etiology of GD is unclear, and findings of VZV in the lesions often are inconsistent. We describe 2 immunocompromised patients who presented with GD following VZV infection; their lesions were examined for the presence of VZV. We also review the literature on postzoster GD.
