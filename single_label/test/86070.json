{"id":86070,"title":"Cardiac valve calcifications on low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography: inter-observer and inter-examination reliability, agreement and variability.","abstract":"To determine inter-observer and inter-examination variability for aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral valve and annulus calcification (MC) in low-dose unenhanced ungated lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT).We included 578 lung cancer screening trial participants who were examined by CT twice within 3 months to follow indeterminate pulmonary nodules. On these CTs, AVC and MC were measured in cubic millimetres. One hundred CTs were examined by five observers to determine the inter-observer variability. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics (?) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Variability was expressed as the mean difference ± standard deviation (SD).Inter-examination reliability was excellent for AVC (??=?0.94, ICC?=?0.96) and MC (??=?0.95, ICC?=?0.90). Inter-examination variability was 12.7?±?118.2 mm(3) for AVC and 31.5?±?219.2 mm(3) for MC. Inter-observer reliability ranged from ??=?0.68 to ??=?0.92 for AVC and from ??=?0.20 to ??=?0.66 for MC. Inter-observer ICC was 0.94 for AVC and ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 for MC. Inter-observer variability ranged from -30.5?±?252.0 mm(3) to 84.0?±?240.5 mm(3) for AVC and from -95.2?±?210.0 mm(3) to 303.7?±?501.6 mm(3) for MC.AVC can be quantified with excellent reliability on ungated unenhanced low-dose chest CT, but manual detection of MC can be subject to substantial inter-observer variability. Lung cancer screening CT may be used for detection and quantification of cardiac valve calcifications.• Low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography can detect cardiac valve calcifications. • However, calcified cardiac valves are not reported by most radiologists. • Inter-observer and inter-examination variability of aortic valve calcifications is sufficient for longitudinal studies. • Volumetric measurement variability of mitral valve and annulus calcifications is substantial.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816936","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.842163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.732141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.716692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.562149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.553583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.454088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.365993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.331007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.32759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.316945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.277528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.197283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0800639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_fibrosus_disci_intervertebralis"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Metastatic calcification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_calcification"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Cubic crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system"}]}
