{"id":12643,"title":"Humanized NOD-SCID IL2rg–/– mice as a preclinical model for cancer research and its potential use for individualized cancer therapies.","abstract":"Humanized mouse models have been developed and utilized in cancer research for decades. Newly developed combined immunodeficient NOD-SCID-IL2rg–/– mice are more permissive for human cells and tissue engraftment. In this review, we discuss the use of NOD-SCID-IL2rg(–/–) mice as a preclinical tool in cancer research and its potential use for individualized cancer therapies.","date":"2014-03-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513265","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.611415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.534708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.222846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.0215179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"}]}
