{"id":69269,"title":"Traumatic neuroma of the penis.","abstract":"Traumatic neuromas are tumors produced by a reactive process to regenerate injured nerves that result in a disordered proliferation of nerve bundles. These tumors are usually related to previous surgery or trauma. We describe a case of traumatic neuroma on the penis of a 24-year-old man; the tumor was initially suspected to be a condyloma. A shave biopsy was both diagnostic and curative.
