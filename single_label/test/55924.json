{"id":55924,"title":"Evaluating the safety of air travel for patients with scleral buckles and small volumes of intraocular gas.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of scleral buckling on intraocular pressure (IOP) change during atmospheric decompression for eyes with small volumes of intravitreal gas.12 eyes of 12 patients, including 6 with and 6 without scleral buckles, were evaluated in a hypobaric chamber simulating air travel approximately 1?month post pars plana vitrectomy with 15% C3F8 gas fluid exchange. The chamber was decompressed with an ascent rate of 300?feet/min to a peak altitude of 8000?feet. After 15?min of cruising, descent was undertaken at 300?feet/min. IOP was measured at baseline and then every 5?min using slit-lamp mounted Goldmann applanation tonometry. The data were entered onto a spreadsheet and comparative statistics were done.During ascent, IOP steadily rose from an average of 13±3?mm?Hg to a peak of 26±9?mm?Hg at 8000?feet. Patients with scleral buckles had significantly lower peak IOPs compared with those without buckles (20±5?mm?Hg vs 32±8?mm?Hg, p=0.013, t test) representing lower absolute increases in IOP (7±1?mm?Hg vs 19±7?mm?Hg, p=0.001, t test) and lower percentage increases in IOP from baseline (62±25% vs 140±40%, respectively).Eyes with small volumes of intravitreal gas demonstrate significant IOP changes during atmospheric decompression in simulated flight. The presence of a scleral buckle significantly limits the magnitude of IOP change, suggesting that such patients can likely tolerate typical air travel without undue risk of dangerous IOP elevation.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Eye
