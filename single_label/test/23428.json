{"id":23428,"title":"[Factors linked to foveoschisis in high myopia].","abstract":"To investigate the factors linked to foveoschisis in high myopia.Retrospective study of 113 patients (200 eyes) with high myopia was conducted between January 2010 and June 2012. Subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT TOPCON 2000) and ocular echography.Of the 200 eyes, 22 (11%) had foveoschisis on OCT examination. On the basis of univariate analysis, five variables were associated with the pathologic changes, including spherical equivalent over 10 diopters (P=0.044), axial length over 30 mm (P=0.0028), macular chorioretinal atrophy (P=0.0009), posterior staphyloma (P=0.0007) and vitreoretinal interface factors (P=0.0002). In the multivariate analysis, three factors were independently associated with foveoschisis in high myopia: axial length (adjusted OR, 16.7; IC 95% 1.4-219.7, P=0.036), macular chorioretinal atrophy (adjusted OR, 13.2; IC 95%, 1.3-133.1, P=0.044), and vitreoretinal interface factors (adjusted OR, 36.1; IC 95%, 3.5-376.9, P=0.002).In our study, axial length, macular chorioretinal atrophy, and vitreoretinal interface factors were independently associated foveoschisis in highly myopic eyes.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486073","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.840206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.536507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.456059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.199762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.185593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.172373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Optical axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_axis"},{"name":"30 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Interface (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(chemistry)"}]}
