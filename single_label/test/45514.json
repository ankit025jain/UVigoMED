{"id":45514,"title":"Abdominosacral resection: long-term outcome in 86 patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent rectal cancer.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of abdominosacral resections (ASR) in patients with locally advanced or recurrent rectal cancer.From 1994 until 2012 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) underwent a curative ASR and were enrolled in a database. The postoperative complication rates, predictive factors on oncological outcome and survival rates were registered.Seventy-two patients with LRRC (mean age 63; 44 male, 28 female) and 14 patients with LARC (mean age 65; 6 male, 8 female) underwent ASR. R0 resection was achieved in 37 patients with LRRC and 11 patients with LARC. Twenty-seven patients underwent an R1 resection (3 in the LARC group). Eight patients had an R2 resection, compared to no patients in the LARC group. In respectively 26 and 1 patients of the LRRC and LARC groups a grade 3 or 4 complication occurred and the 30-days mortality rate was respectively 3% and 7%. The 5-years overall survival was 28% and 24% respectively.En bloc radical resection remains the primary goal in the treatment of dorsally located (recurrent) rectal cancer. After thorough patient selection, ASR is a safe procedure to perform, shows acceptable morbidity rates and leads to a good oncological outcome.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679359","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.796716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.723162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.625983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.516807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.303229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.27036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"LRRC (Luddite Rural Recording Cooperative)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRRC_(Luddite_Rural_Recording_Cooperative)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Speech recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Eastern Bloc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"1994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"UNIVAC LARC","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_LARC"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
