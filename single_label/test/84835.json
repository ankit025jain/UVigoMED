{"id":84835,"title":"[Canalplasty for stenosis or atresia of the external auditory canal].","abstract":"To report the experience of canalplasty in treatment of stenosis or atresia of the external auditory canal.A retrospective review was performed on 10 patients (10 ears) that underwent canalplasty. The lesions located in bony segment in 1 case, cartilaginous segment in 3 cases, both in cartilaginous and bony segments in 6 cases, in which 4 cases accompanied with the middle ear diseases. All patients received the canalplasty surgery, and tympanoplasty was applied simultaneously if the patient had otitis media.Follow-up was conducted for 8-50 months respectively, 8 of the external auditory canal was wide and tympanic membrane gained a good shape, 2 case had stenosis or atresia reoccurrence after the operation.Appropriate approach and elimination of the lesions thoroughly are key points for the canalplasty.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026828","annotations":[{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Ear canal","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.534626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.443838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.441581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.0498441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"850","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/850"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Tensor tympani muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
