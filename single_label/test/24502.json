{"id":24502,"title":"[Use of darunavir in HIV-infected women during pregnancy].","abstract":"The use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) in a mother and a child can reduce the risk of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to less than 1%; therefore, highly active antiretroviral therapy is used in all pregnant women regardless of indications for HIV-infection treatment. The major requirements for choosing an ARVD to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission are its high safety for a pregnant woman, a fetus, and a baby and its high therapeutic efficacy. Clinical trials of darunavir (DRV) in adults and children have shown a high virologic response, good tolerance, and safety. Trials and observations have demonstrated the high efficacy and safety of a DRV when used in pregnant women. Pharmacokinetic studies in pregnant women have indicated the effective and well-tolerated concentration of a DRV when it is co-administered with low-dose ritonavir, which permits the use of a DRV for both the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission and the treatment of pregnant women who require antiretroviral therapy. The Russian clinical protocol \"Use of ARVDs in the package of measures for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission\" approved by the National Scientific Society of Infectiologists in 2013 recommends DRV as an alternative drug in antiretroviral therapy regimens for pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission and to treat maternal HIV infection.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432610","annotations":[{"name":"Ritonavir","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Vertical transmission","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_transmission"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.712861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.518382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.475452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.399276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.330451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Darunavir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darunavir"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
