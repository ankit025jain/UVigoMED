{"id":51136,"title":"Long-term outcomes of extracorporeal shockwave therapy for chronic foot ulcers.","abstract":"Recent studies showed that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is effective in the treatment of chronic foot ulcers in short term. However, the long-term effects of ESWT in chronic foot ulcers are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of ESWT in chronic foot ulcers with 5-y follow-up.The study cohort consisted of 67 patients with 72 ulcers including 38 patients with 40 ulcers in the diabetes mellitus (DM) group and 29 patients with 32 ulcers in the non-diabetes mellitus (non-DM) group. Each patient received ESWT to the affected foot twice per week for 3 wk for a total of six treatments. The evaluations included clinical assessment for the ulcer status, local blood flow perfusion, and analysis of mortality and morbidity.The results showed completely healed ulcers in 55.6% and 57.4% of total series, 48% and 43% of DM group, and 66% and 71% of non-DM group at 1 and 5 y (P = 0.022 and P = 0.027), respectively. The mortality rate was 15% in total series, 24% in DM group, and 3% in non-DM group (P = 0.035). The rate of amputation was 11% in total series, 17% in DM group, and 3.6% in non-DM group (P = 0.194). The blood flow perfusion rate significantly increased after ESWT for up to 1 yr but decreased from 1-5 y in both groups. However, the non-DM group showed significantly better blood flow perfusion than the DM group at 5 y (P = 0.04).ESWT appears effective in chronic diabetic and nondiabetic foot ulcers. However, the effects decreased from 1-5 y after treatment.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721603","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.581834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.514693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.163883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"}]}
