{"id":44250,"title":"Treatment of large colorectal neoplasms by endoscopic submucosal dissection: a European single-center study.","abstract":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has a high curative resection rate for gastrointestinal mucosal lesions, but is not used widely in Europe because of a high complication rate and a long learning curve. This study analyzed the ESD learning curve at a single European treatment center.ESD and hybrid-ESD (hESD) procedures were used to treat large colonic lesions that could not be resected in one piece by other endoscopic methods. Procedure duration and speed, and en-bloc, complete (R0) resection, and complication rates were analyzed.Fifty-three patients underwent ESD (37 pure ESD, 16 hESD), most with rectal lesions (n=34, 64.2%). The mean lesion diameter was 3.7 Â± 1.1 cm2 (range 2.0-7.0 cm), the median procedure duration was 70.0 min [interquartile range (IQR) 31.0-113.0 min], and the median treatment speed was 0.086 cm2/min (IQR 0.055-0.152). En-bloc and R0 resection rates were 86.5% (32/37) and 81.1% (30/37), respectively. Procedure speed increased significantly after about 25 cases (P=0.0313). The median hESD procedure treatment speed was 0.159 cm/min (n=16, IQR 0.094-0.193), which was better than with classical ESD (P=0.04). The hESD en-bloc and R0 resection rates were comparable to those of classical ESD (P>0.05). The only complication was bleeding, 5.7% (3/53); no perforation occurred. Recurrence was detected during follow-up (median 30.0 months, IQR 12-48) in one patient (1.7%).ESD is useful and safe for resection of large colorectal polyps, and procedure speed increased considerably after 25 procedures. hESD was faster than ESD, with a high therapeutic resection rate.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743502","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.535622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.456815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.364585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"}]}
