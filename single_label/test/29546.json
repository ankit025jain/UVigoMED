{"id":29546,"title":"[Peculiarities of hypnotic effect and pharmacokinetics of hemisuccinate 3-hydroxyphenazepam (levana)].","abstract":"The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of hemisuccinate 3-hydroxyphenazepam (HS-3-HPh, levana)--a new hypnotic 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative--have been studied. It is established that HS-3-HPh in doses of 0.05, 0.1 and 2 mg/kg produces reliable hypnotic action (shortens the period of falling asleep, reduces the number of awakenings at night-time, and increases sleep duration) in the hexenal sleep potentiation test on mice. After a 7-day drug administration, no withdrawal syndrome has been observed. The concentration of 3-oxyphenazepam (3-OP, the main metabolite of HS-3-HPh) in brain after drug administration is significantly higher than the content of 3-OP upon its introduction. The content of 3-OP upon its introduction rapidly decreases, while that upon the administration of HS-3-HPh is retained on a stationary level for a rather long time (about 6 h). It can be suggested that a specific character of HS-3-HPh hypnotic action is determined by peculiarities of its pharmacokinetics, namely, easier entering the brain and subsequent hydrolysis with release of the active metabolite (3-OP).","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649593","annotations":[{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.808784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.746831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Hypnotic","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.722632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.650522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Active metabolite","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_metabolite"},{"name":"Horsepower-hour","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower-hour"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Dominican Order","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
