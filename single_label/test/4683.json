{"id":4683,"title":"Interexaminer and intraexaminer reliabilities of 3-dimensional orthodontic digital setups.","abstract":"The use of digital orthodontic setups has grown quickly. The purpose of this study was to test the interexaminer and intraexaminer reliabilities of 3-dimensional orthodontic digital setups in OrthoCAD (Align Technology, San Jose, Calif).Six clinicians made digital orthodontic setups on 6 digital models twice, with a minimum interval of 2 weeks and a maximum interval of 4 weeks. OrthoCAD software was used, and treatment goals were all set the same according to the American Board of Orthodontics Objective Grading System (ABO-OGS). Differences between the 72 setups were measured with the ABO-OGS scores.In comparing setups 1 and 2, the intraexaminer mean absolute differences in total ABO-OGS scores varied statistically significantly between 2.17 and 6.00 points. Interexaminer mean absolute differences varied statistically significantly between 4.77 and 5.56 points. All but 1 intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value showed significant excellent agreement (ICC, >0.8) for intraexaminer reliability. One ICC value was insignificant and showed moderate (ICC, 0.4-0.6) agreement. Interexaminer reliability showed significant good (ICC, 0.6-0.8) agreement.There is a significant difference in ABO-OGS score when using OrthoCAD. Although this difference was low, it could be clinically significant. Interexaminer and intraexaminer reliabilities are not redundant for general use of the 3-dimensional orthodontic digital setup in OrthoCAD.","date":"2014-11-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25432262","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.449497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.30341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.164585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0659939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Absolute value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Board_of_Commissioners_for_Foreign_Missions"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Redundancy (engineering)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"San Jose, California","weight":0.0113784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California"}]}
