{"id":51265,"title":"Decreased dendritic cell numbers but increased TLR9-mediated interferon-alpha production in first degree relatives of type 1 diabetes patients.","abstract":"Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in pathogenesis of autoimmunity, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this study, we investigated DC subpopulations and their responses to TLR stimulation in T1D patients and their relatives.We analyzed the frequency of myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in 97 T1D patients (69 onset, 28 long-term), 67 first-degree relatives, and 64 controls. We additionally tested the IFN-alpha production by pDCs upon stimulation with TLR 7, 8 and 9 agonists.A lower number of mDCs and pDCs were found in T1D patients and their relatives. Of all the tested TLR ligands, only stimulation with CpG 2216 induced IFN-alpha production that was the highest in T1D relatives, except of autoantibody-negative relatives bearing the protective haplotypes.Our data demonstrate disturbances in DC number and function expressed most significantly in T1D relatives and point to a potential role of TLR9-induced IFN-alpha production in T1D development.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709112","annotations":[{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.715967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.639777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.583205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.266983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.227396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"TLR 7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_7"},{"name":"TLR9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR9"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"DC Comics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Dendrite (crystal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite_(crystal)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
