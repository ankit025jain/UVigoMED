{"id":81977,"title":"Direct composite restorations in anterior teeth. Managing symmetry in central incisors.","abstract":"In direct restorations of anterior teeth, particularly central incisors, symmetry plays an important role. The clinician can take advantage of silicone indexes based on a wax-up to build palatal and incisal walls; however, when he has to reproduce free-hand chair-side symmetrical items like interproximal emergence profiles, macro- and microsurface textures, and chromatic characteristics, the result can often be unpredictable. A step-by-step class IV restoration treatment will be described, as well as a simple procedure to help reproduce, check and correct symmetrically interproximal wall contours and chromatic characteristics.
