{"id":4675,"title":"Effect of occlusal vertical dimension changes on postsurgical skeletal changes in a surgery-first approach for skeletal Class III deformities.","abstract":"The purposes of this study were to investigate the relationship between occlusal vertical dimension (VD) changes and postsurgical skeletal changes in the surgery-first approach and to derive regression models for the final mandibular setback at B-point.This retrospective study included 40 patients (16 men, 24 women; ages, 22.6 ± 4.0 years) who had undergone a bimaxillary surgery-first approach. Using cephalograms generated from cone-beam computed tomography representing the presurgical, postsurgical, and posttreatment stages, skeletal landmarks in the maxilla and mandible were investigated to derive multivariate linear regression-based prediction models. Additionally, a patient classification based on the VD was established and verified to generate regression models for the classified groups.For the nonincreased VD group, the surgical setback of B-point was its predictor for the final mandibular setback (R(2) at 92%). Meanwhile, the final mandibular setback of the increased VD group was predicted according to the surgical upward movement of pogonion, the postsurgical horizontal position of A-point, and the postsurgical vertical position of the coronoid process (R(2) at 94%).The results of this study support the clinical observation that the more increased the vertical occlusal dimension after surgery, the less predictable the position of B-point at the posttreatment stage.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439212","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.645528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.356851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.252847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.227397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.184057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Coronoid process of the mandible","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronoid_process_of_the_mandible"},{"name":"Vertical dimension of occlusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_dimension_of_occlusion"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Stage (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Setback (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setback_(architecture)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Student loan","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan"},{"name":"Landmark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark"}]}
