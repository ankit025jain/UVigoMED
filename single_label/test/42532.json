{"id":42532,"title":"Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy treatment of colorectal peritoneal metastases: cohort analysis of high volume disease and cure rate.","abstract":"Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) treatment of colorectal peritoneal metastases (PM) is an established treatment alternative. The study aim was, first, to investigate the outcome of high-volume disease defined by the peritoneal cancer index (PCI) 20; second, to report the long-term disease-free survival of patients with >5 years observation.Consecutive patients with colorectal PM from a prospective HIPEC database between 2004 and 2010 were included, 67 patients. Clinicopathological and outcome parameters were compared between low PCI (n?=?40) and high PCI (n?=?27). A subgroup analysis on patients with >5 years observation was performed (n?=?32). Disease-free survival after 5 years defined cure.Median overall survival (OS) was 28 months, low PCI-group 33 months versus high PCI-group 17 months (P?=?0.03). Median OS of patients with complete CRS (n?=?56) was 30 months, low PCI-group 37 months versus high PCI-group 27 months (P?=?0.2), with 5-year survival of 31% and 21%, respectively. No difference in morbidity/mortality. The cure rate was 22% in the subgroup (7/32) and 28% in those with complete CRS (7/25). Two patients in the cured group had PCI 29 and 34.Treatment of high-volume disease may result in long-term survival and even cure. The key is to reach a complete CRS. The overall cure rate is 22%.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846340","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.74952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.744486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.703806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Primary peritoneal carcinoma","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_peritoneal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.639547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.536874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.358118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Conventional PCI","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Prime minister","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"732","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/732"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
