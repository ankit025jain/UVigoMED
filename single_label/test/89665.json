{"id":89665,"title":"[Treatment strategy of osteochondral defects of knee joint].","abstract":"To review the current treatment status of osteochondral defects (OCD) of the knee joint.Recent literature concerning treatment of OCD of the knee joint was extensively reviewed and summarized.OCD affect both the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone, whereas OCD caused by different etiologies require various treatments. OCD repair is available by conventional clinical methods or the advanced tissue engineering strategies. Current clinical treatment outcomes remain uncertain; tissue engineering has emerged as a potential option as it can be efficiently applied to regenerate bone, cartilage, and the bone-cartilage interface, as well as effectively restore normal function and mechanical properties of the cartilage and subchondral bone.OCD management and repair remain a great challenge in orthopedic surgery, thus cartilage and subchondral bone should be promoted as an interdependent functional unit considering treatment strategies to provide the best solution for the treatment of osteochondral defects.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693792","annotations":[{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.795537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.594783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.319198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.313905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.30151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.281574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Osteochondritis dissecans","weight":0.149621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondritis_dissecans"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Normal function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_function"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Execution unit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_unit"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Interdependence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependence"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Osteochondrosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrosis"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
