{"id":40936,"title":"Discrepancy rates in liver biopsy reporting.","abstract":"Medical liver biopsy reporting is challenging, and maintaining competency with small case numbers is potentially difficult. This study evaluates the discrepancies identified in cases referred to a specialist centre between the specialist reports and those of the referring general departments. Fifty consecutive recently referred cases were selected, and original and final reports were compared. Discrepancies were classified as per the Royal College of Pathologists guidelines and scored for potential clinical impact. The overall rate of discrepancy was 38% with most of these due to differences in interpretation of morphology. Seventy per cent of these discrepancies were judged to have major clinical impact (26% of all referred cases). This study highlights the need for robust systems of quality control of liver biopsies in a general setting.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970902","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.330364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Royal College of Pathologists","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Pathologists"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Academic department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_department"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Royal College of Surgeons","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
