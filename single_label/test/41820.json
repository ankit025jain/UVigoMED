{"id":41820,"title":"Consumer use of over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.","abstract":"Optimal administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) requires consideration of meal timing. Since becoming available over the counter (OTC), no studies have assessed treatment patterns and symptom control in OTC consumers. The objective of this study was to survey dosing patterns and symptom control in OTC and prescription PPI users.Patients at five clinics were surveyed regarding diagnosis of GERD, use of OTC or prescription PPIs, information on time of day dosing, demographics, and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS; 2001, Johnson & Johnson).Of the 1,959 patients surveyed, 610 (31%) used PPIs for GERD. Of these, 190 (31%) and 223 (37%) received prescriptions from gastroenterologists (GIs) and primary care physicians (PCPs), respectively; 197 (32%) purchased OTC PPIs. Of the patients prescribed PPIs by GIs, 71% were optimal users, whereas 47% of patients receiving prescriptions from PCPs and 39% of consumers used PPIs optimally (P<0.001 compared with GIs). GSAS symptom, frequency, and severity scores were significantly better in patients prescribed PPIs by GIs (all P<0.001, GI compared with PCP and consumer). GSAS symptom, frequency, and severity scores were also significantly better in patients using PPIs optimally (P<0.001 for all parameters) compared with those taking PPIs suboptimally or excessively.Patients receiving prescription PPI from a GI are more likely to be optimal users with better symptom control. Conversely, consumers are more likely to be suboptimal users with inadequate symptom control.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896751","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.836512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.833959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.833031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.750305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Over-the-counter drug","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.465351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.319884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.219491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Phencyclidine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"Lyndon B.
