{"id":8669,"title":"Roles of PAR1 and PAR2 in viral myocarditis.","abstract":"Viral myocarditis is estimated to cause ~20% of sudden death in people under the age of 40. A variety of viruses have been found to cause myocarditis including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Many studies have been performed with CVB3 because there is a mouse model of CVB3-induced myocarditis. Studies have shown that the TLR3-IFN? pathway plays a central role in the innate immune response to CVB3 infection. Our laboratory studies the role of protease activated receptors (PAR) in different biological responses including viral infection. We examined the effect of a deficiency in either PAR1 or PAR2 on CVB3-induced myocarditis. Interestingly, we found that PAR1 knockout mice had increased cardiac injury whereas PAR2 knockout mice had decreased cardiac injury. Our studies support the notion that PARs modulate the innate immune response and can have both positive and negative effects on TLR-dependent responses.
