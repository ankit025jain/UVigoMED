{"id":62143,"title":"Primary bone lymphoma in a 10-year-old boy.","abstract":"Primary bone lymphoma has been defined as a solitary lesion in bone, without concomitant involvement of the extra osseous hematopoietic system, with no evidence of extra osseous disease within 6 months of the onset of symptoms. The vast majority of cases are of the large B-cell non-Hodgkin type. They are rare bone tumor. Distinguishing primary bone lymphoma from other bone tumors is important because the former has a better response to therapy and a better prognosis.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617185","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Bone tumor","weight":0.65261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_tumor"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.18632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"}]}
