{"id":87910,"title":"[Diagnostic and therapeutic problems of bilateral carotid-cavernous sinus fistula].","abstract":"Carotid-cavernous sinus fistula is an abnormal connection between the internal carotid artery, external one or their meningeal branches and the sinus cavernous. It can be the spontaneous or post-traumatic pathology. The main clinical syndrome is Dandy's triad: pulsating exophthalmia, chemosis, bruit in the region of orbit. These syndromes appear in the case of the most frequent direct carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (type-A in Barrow classification). Indirect carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are significantly more uncommon and the symptoms can be atypical and less intensive. It makes difficulties in establishing the right diagnosis. The case report concerns the occurrence of bilateral carotid-cavernous sinus fistula, supplying by numerous arteries, with atypical clinical picture.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964514","annotations":[{"name":"Internal carotid artery","weight":0.791235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.768143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.764377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Meninges","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges"},{"name":"External carotid artery","weight":0.620849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.59495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.551401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.324131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Bruit","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruit"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Chemosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosis"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Posterior meningeal artery","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_meningeal_artery"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
