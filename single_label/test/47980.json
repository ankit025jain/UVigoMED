{"id":47980,"title":"Modulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced autophagy by C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1? (IRE1?) in human colon cancer cells.","abstract":"To explore the relationship between UPR and autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells, we investigated whether autophagy was induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in colon cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that autophagy was induced by ER stress in HT29, SW480, and Caco-2 cells. In these cells, inositol-requiring enzyme1? (IRE1?) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were involved in the ER stress-autophagy pathway, and CHOP was a regulator of IRE1? protein expression. Our findings suggest that CHOP promotes IRE1? and autophagy especially in ER stress conditions. This study will provide important insights into the disclosure of the ER stress-autophagy pathway.
