{"id":86106,"title":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in cardiopulmonary disease in adults.","abstract":"The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for both respiratory and cardiac failure in adults is evolving rapidly. Advances in technology and accumulating data are spurring greater interest and explosive growth in ECMO worldwide. Expanding indications and novel strategies are being used. Yet the use of ECMO outpaces the data. The promise of a major paradigm shift for the treatment of respiratory and cardiac failure is tempered by a need for evidence to support many current and potential future uses. The authors review cannulation strategies, indications, and evidence for ECMO in respiratory and cardiac failure in adults as well as potential applications and the impact they may have on current treatment paradigms.
