{"id":65396,"title":"[Expression and clinical significance of transcription factors in prostate cancer].","abstract":"To explore the roles of various transcription factors in the occurrence and development of prostate cancer.A total of 139 specimens with prostate cancer (PCa) and 83 specimens with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from hospitalized patients at our hospital from 2008 to 2011 were enrolled. The mRNA expressions of c-Myc, Klf4, Nanog, Oct4A and Sox2 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the expressions of Klf4 isoforms by conventional PCR. Immunohistochemical method was used for the detection of Klf4 protein via tissue microarray in 404 prostate samples.No significant difference existed in the expressions of Nanog, Oct4A and Sox2 genes between BPH and PCa samples. And the expressions of c-Myc and Klf4 genes were significantly higher in PCa than those in BPH specimens. Immunohistochemical results showed that Klf4 protein could be detected in a large majority of epithelial prostatic cells irrespective of malignant transformation. However, it was predominantly located cytoplasmically in PCa tissues and remained consistent with the expression of a differentially spliced Klf4? isoform.Klf4 is highly expressed in both BPH and PCa tissues. But in malignant cells, a specific gene product Klf4? is predominantly detectable in cytoplasm. The positioning of Klf4 protein may have an important relationship with its role in the tumorigenic process.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844959","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.850105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.709729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Homeobox protein NANOG","weight":0.68837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox_protein_NANOG"},{"name":"SOX2","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX2"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.66167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Gene product","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_product"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.534078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.430984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.420769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Oct-4","weight":0.401318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-4"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.393227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.38029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.316071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.198175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Kruppel-like factors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruppel-like_factors"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
