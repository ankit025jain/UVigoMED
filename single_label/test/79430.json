{"id":79430,"title":"[Cerebral circulation in the patients presenting with the early disorders of the sound perception function].","abstract":"The present paper is focused on the study of the auditory function and cerebral circulation estimated based on the results of rheoencephalographc examination of 75 patients presenting with disordered sound perception and divided into two groups. Group 1 was comprised of the patients complaining of impaired hearing of the tones only within the extended frequency range (9-16 kHz), group 2 consisted of the patients suffering impaired hearing in the conventional frequency range (0.125-8 kHz). It was shown that the brainstem structures of the auditory analyzer in the patients of both groups remained unaffected whereas the cortical structures thereof in the patients of group 2 exhibited the signs of dysfunction. Cerebral circulation was disturbed in both groups, but its changes were especially well pronounced in the patients of group 2. These findings are of interest in the context of diagnostics and treatment of the patients presenting with early disorders of the sound perception function.
