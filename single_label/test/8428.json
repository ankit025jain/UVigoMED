{"id":8428,"title":"Complete sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of porcine kobuvirus in domestic pigs in Northwest China.","abstract":"Porcine kobuvirus, a member of the genus Kobuvirus that is associated with diarrhea, has been reported in many countries. We determined the complete genome sequence and investigated the genetic evolution of the kobuvirus strain swKoV CH441, which was detected in the highland of Gansu province in Northwest China. The viral genome is 8149 nucleotides (nt) long, including a 29-nt poly(A) tail of the 3' end, and is 90 nt shorter in the 2B coding region than those of other kobuvirus strains whose sequences are available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis showed that swKoV CH441 was most closely related to porcine kobuvirus CH/HNXX-4 but more distantly related to other strains, including the strains GS-1/2012/CH and GS-2/2012/CH, which were detected in Gansu province, indicating that porcine kobuvirus may have geographic and host differences in evolution.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777826","annotations":[{"name":"Genus","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.78965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Polyadenylation","weight":0.755162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.651808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.637842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.604701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.584737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Gansu","weight":0.543158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.531971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.38229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Full genome sequencing","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_genome_sequencing"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Suidae","weight":0.192037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suidae"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.118306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Northwest China","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_China"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Moon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest"}]}
