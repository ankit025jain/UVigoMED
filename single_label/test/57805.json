{"id":57805,"title":"Performance of multidetector CT in the evaluation of the endometrium: Measurement of endometrial thickness and detection of disease.","abstract":"To evaluate the performance of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in the measurement of endometrial thickness and assessment for endometrial disease.Seventy-nine MDCT examinations, including sagittal reformats from isotropic data, were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of endometrial abnormality, endometrial thickness, and recommendation for transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) after CT. The endometrial thickness was measured on sagittal images using two different methods, between the inner-to-inner hypoattenuating stripe, and when visible, between the outer-to-outer hyperattenuating stripe. TVUS performed within 48 h of CT in premenopausal and 1 month in postmenopausal patients served as reference standard. Interobserver agreement for endometrial thickness and abnormalities was assessed using concordance correlation (CC) and kappa statistics.Interobserver agreement for endometrial thickness on sagittal CT images was excellent (CC 0.98), and highly accurate using the inner-to-inner measurement. For determination of abnormal thickening, the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 67-100% and 99.5-100%. For detection of any endometrial abnormality, the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 79-90% and 84-95%, respectively. False-negative missed abnormalities included small volume hydrometra, a polyp, and endometrial distortion by a fibroid.At MDCT, sagittal reformatted images provide reliable endometrial measurement using the inner-to-inner hypoattenuating stripe and are accurately categorized as normal or abnormal thickness using the same numerical criteria as at sonography.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060929","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray
