{"id":37182,"title":"Identification of skull base sutures and craniofacial anomalies in children with craniosynostosis: utility of multidetector CT.","abstract":"Craniosynostosis is a condition characterised by the premature fusion of one or more of the cranial sutures. The aim of the study was to identify, by multidetector computed tomography (CT), the involvement of vault sutures as well as of the skull base sutures (named \"minor\" sutures). The latter ones are involved in development of craniofacial and skull base deformities.We retrospectively reviewed 27 children with complex synostosis (n = 21) and anterior synostotic plagiocephaly (n = 6). High-resolution CT images with bone definition algorithm and tridimensional volume rendering reconstructions were assessed.In 27 children we found different sutures involved in the synostotic process, including both major and minor skull suture synostosis, and synostosis of synchondroses. Superior orbital rim deformity, nasal root deviation, anterior endocranial axis deviation (ethmoidal axis) are found in children with coronal arch synostosis, while reduced size of the posterior fossa and Chiari 1 malformation are noted in children with lambdoid arch synostosis.High-resolution CT allows an accurate identification of both \"major\" and \"minor\" skull base suture synostosis and it represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of craniostenosis and for planning the proper surgical approach.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
