{"id":82368,"title":"Digital plaque imaging evaluation of a stabilized stannous fluoride dentifrice compared with a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice.","abstract":"To compare the relative plaque control efficacy of a marketed 0.454% stabilized stannous fluoride (SnF2) dentifrice relative to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice using digital plaque imaging analysis (DPIA).This was a randomized, two-treatment, double-blind, parallel group design study that compared SnF2 and triclosan/copolymer dentifrices over a period of 3 weeks. DPIA was used to capture a digital image of the maxillary and mandibular anterior facial surfaces of 12 teeth and to calculate plaque area coverage. Overnight DPIA images were taken at a baseline visit after which subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups and were required to brush with their assigned dentifrice according to each manufacturer's instructions. Subjects had DPIA assessments on two separate days at the end of Week 3.96 subjects were randomized to treatment. Plaque area data for 47 subjects per treatment group were compared at Week 3 using ANCOVA. The SnF2 group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in overnight plaque at Week 3 compared to baseline (P= 0.002). The reduction for the triclosan group at Week 3 compared to baseline was not statistically significant (P= 0.24). At Week 3, the SnF2 group demonstrated a 17% lower adjusted mean for overnight plaque relative to the triclosan group with a mean difference that was statistically significant (P< 0.05). The Week 3 adjusted mean change from baseline in overnight plaque for the SnF2 group was 3 times greater versus that of the triclosan group (P< 0.05).","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640432","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.122269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.108378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Triclosan","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"Dentifrice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentifrice"},{"name":"Tin(II) fluoride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_fluoride"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Brush","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush"},{"name":"Tin(II) chloride","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_chloride"},{"name":"The Week","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Week"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Digital photography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography"},{"name":"Overnight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Digital image","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image"}]}
