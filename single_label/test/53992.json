{"id":53992,"title":"The effect of PDRN, an adenosine receptor A2A agonist, on the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers: results of a clinical trial.","abstract":"Foot ulcer is the principal cause of hospitalization for patients with diabetes. Polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), an adenosine A2A receptor agonist, improves wound healing in diabetic mice.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PDRN on chronic ulcer healing in patients with diabetes.This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, involved two medical centers in Italy.Patients with diabetes showing hard-to-heal ulcers (Wagner grade 1 or 2) were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 106) or PDRN (n = 110). The treatments (PDRN and placebo) were performed 3 days a week for 8 weeks by intramuscular and perilesional route.The primary outcome was complete ulcer healing. Secondary outcomes were the days needed to complete wound closure and the reepithelialization of wound surface (as percentage of the original area).After 8 weeks, 91 placebo and 101 PDRN subjects completed the study. Complete healing was achieved in 18.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.4-26.3] of placebo and in 37.3% (95% CI 28.2-46.3) of PDRN-treated patients (P = .0027). After 8 weeks, PDRN increased the closure of foot ulcers in diabetic subjects (hazard ratio 2.20; 95% CI 1.29-3.75; P = .004). The median time to complete wound healing was 49 days for placebo (range 28-56 d) and 30 days for PDRN-treated subjects (range 14-56 d; P = .0027). The median epithelialized area of the ulcers (expressed as percentage) was 49.3% in the placebo and 82.2% in the PDRN group (P < .001).PDRN facilitates the healing of Wagner 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcers.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483158","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.609814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.587777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.581834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.496351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.439001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Adenosine receptor","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_receptor"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.368238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.252368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.144841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Richard Wagner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"1456","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1456"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"First grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_grade"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"A2A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2A"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 426","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_426"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
