{"id":82001,"title":"Acupuncture in the management of acute dental pain.","abstract":"Acute dental pain is the main reason for seeking dental services to provide urgent dental care; there is consensus about the use of alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, to control dental pain in pre-dental care. This study aimed to evaluate the use of acupuncture in reducing the intensity of acute dental pain in pre-dental care in patients waiting for emergency dental care, and was conducted at the After-Hours Emergency Dental Clinic of Piracicaba Dental School, and at the Emergency Center Dental Specialties I in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. The sample consisted of 120 patients. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity. All patients underwent one session of acupuncture; the points LI4, ST44 and CV23 were selected and were used alone or in combinations. Reduction in pain was observed in 120 patients (mean initial VAS=6.558±1.886, p<0; mean final VAS=0.962±2.163, p<0.00001). The results of this study indicate that acupuncture analgesia could be a technical adjunct to pain control in patients with acute dental pain, contributing to the restoration of health with social benefit.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745864","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Toothache","weight":0.342722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothache"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.341081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Piracicaba","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracicaba"},{"name":"M62 locomotive","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M62_locomotive"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"John Peel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"886","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/886"},{"name":"Liberal International","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_International"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Analog Science Fiction and Fact","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"}]}
