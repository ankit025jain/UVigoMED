{"id":54984,"title":"Alcohol-assisted debridement in PRK with intraoperative mitomycin C.","abstract":"To compare corneal stromal and endothelial cells after photorefractive keratectomy with intraoperative mitomycin C in alcohol-assisted versus mechanical epithelial debridement using confocal microscopy.This prospective randomized comparative study was performed on 88 eyes (44 patients) with myopia up to -6.00 diopters. The right eye of each patient was randomly assigned to either mechanical or alcohol-assisted groups, and the left eye was assigned to the alternate group. Confocal microscopy was performed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively. The main outcome measures were epithelial thickness; number of keratocytes in the anterior, mid-, and posterior stroma; and characteristics of the central corneal endothelial cells in terms of density, mean cell area, and polymegathism and hexagonality.Three months after surgery, no statistically significant difference was noted between the study groups in terms of epithelial thickness. We also found no statistically significant difference in central corneal endothelial cells regarding cell density, mean cell area, hexagonality, or polymegathism. Compared with baseline values, the density of mid- and posterior stromal keratocytes showed no significant change in either group, whereas it decreased significantly in the anterior stroma in both groups 3 months after surgery.We found that the adverse effects of photorefractive keratectomy with mitomycin C on central corneal endothelial cells were comparable between the mechanical and alcohol-assisted epithelial debridement groups and the significant decrease in postoperative keratocyte density in anterior stroma was comparable between the two groups. The choice of their application could be left to the discretion of the ophthalmologist.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25062131","annotations":[{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.923416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.787712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.755272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Corneal keratocyte","weight":0.576877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_keratocyte"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.487823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.346193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.263702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.226009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
