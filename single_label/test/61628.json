{"id":61628,"title":"Rapid separation of mononuclear hodgkin from multinuclear reed-sternberg cells.","abstract":"We describe a method to isolate small mononucleated Hodgkin (H) cells from multinucleated Reed Sternberg (RS) cells of Hodgkin lymphoma using the ScreenCell filter device. This filtration-based approach lends itself to future clinical applications in that it enables the separation of H and RS cells from lymph node biopsies, bone marrow aspirates, pleural effusions, and blood, including the isolation of monoclonal Hodgkin precursor cells from the blood.
