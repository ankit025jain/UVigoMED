{"id":44385,"title":"Genetic immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma by endothelial progenitor cells armed with cytosine deaminase.","abstract":"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) serve as cellular vehicles for targeting cancer cells and are a powerful tool for delivery of therapeutic genes. Cytosine deaminase (CD), a kind of frequent suicide gene which can kill carcinoma cells by converting a non-poisonous pro-drug 5-flucytosine (5-FC) into a poisonous cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We combined super-paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles labeled EPCs with CD gene to treat grafted liver carcinomas and tracked them with 7.0 T Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results showed that the therapeutic EPCs loaded with CD plus 5-Fc provided stronger carcinoma growth suppression compared with treatment using CD alone. The CD/5-Fc significantly inhibited the growth of endothelial cells and induced carcinoma cells apoptosis. These results indicate that EPCs transfected with anti-carcinoma genes can be used in carcinoma therapy as a novel therapeutic modality.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738335","annotations":[{"name":"Prodrug","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.884636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cytosine","weight":0.882464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.824853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Flucytosine","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flucytosine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.623636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.381513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Suicide gene","weight":0.127428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_gene"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.118953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Superparamagnetism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superparamagnetism"},{"name":"Iron oxide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Deamination","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deamination"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"MRI contrast agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_contrast_agent"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"}]}
