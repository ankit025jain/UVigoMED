{"id":31295,"title":"[Relapse prevention in drug addicts].","abstract":"The literature review deals with methods of relapse prevention. Relapse prevention is the key in the treatment of clients with drug addictions according to the transtheoretical model of change. If relapse prevention is more effective then not only the relapse would be prevented, but the client would leave the circulus vitiosus of relapses. Among psychotherapies cognitive behavioural methods are proven effective. Shorter forms of cognitive therapies are also available: for example, cognitive bias modification. Pharmacotherapy partly decreases craving of the clients or ceases the effects of psychoactive substances. Specific pharmacotherapeutic methods prevent relapses in a non-abstinent treatment design. Here the goal is not the abstinence in a short time, but the reduction of harms associated with drug use. In this way, a new target group of drug users can be involved in treatment.","date":"2014-01-01","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24380964","annotations":[{"name":"Cognitive bias","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.705716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.676511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.523563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.405584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.303648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Transtheoretical model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transtheoretical_model"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Craving (withdrawal)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craving_(withdrawal)"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
