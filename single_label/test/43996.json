{"id":43996,"title":"Efficacy and safety of long term entecavir in chronic hepatitis B treatment naïve patients in clinical practice.","abstract":"Entecavir (ETV) is effective and safe in patients with chronic hepatitis B in the short term, but its long term efficacy and safety has not been established.We evaluated HBV DNA clearance, HBeAg/antiHBe and HBsAg/antiHBs seroconversion rates in HBeAg-positive and negative NUC naïve HBV patients treated with ETV for more than 6 months, and predictors of response.A hundred and sixty nine consecutive patients were treated with ETV for a median of 181 weeks. 61% were HBeAg positive, 23% were cirrhotics, and mean HBV-DNA levels were 6,88 ± 1,74 log10 IU/mL. Overall, 156 (92%) patients became HBV DNA undetectable, 92 (88%) HBeAg positive and 64 (98%) HBeAg negative patients. Seventy four (71%) patients cleared HBeAg after a median of 48 weeks of treatment, 23 (14%) patients cleared HBsAg (19 HBeAg positive and 4 HBeAg negative, p 0.025) after a median of 96 weeks of treatment, and 22 (13%) patients developed protective titers of anti-HBs. At the end of the study, 35 (20%) patients had discontinued therapy: 33 HBeAg positive and 2 HBeAg negative; 9 of them (26%) developed virological relapse after a median of 48 weeks of stopping treatment. None of the patients had primary non response and one patient developed breakthrough. Two patients developed HCC, three underwent liver transplantation and 3 deaths were attributable to liver-related events. No serious adverse events were reported.Long term ETV treatment showed high virological response rates, and a favorable safety profile for NUC-naive HBeAg-positive and negative patients treated in clinical practice.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756007","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.726178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.707385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.35769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.355906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"National Union Catalog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_Catalog"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Eesti Televisioon","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Televisioon"},{"name":"Common logarithm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
