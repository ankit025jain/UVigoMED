{"id":18368,"title":"The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) activation is required for phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus by RAW 264.7 cells.","abstract":"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) is a ubiquitous transcription factor which controls the expression of various genes involved in immune responses. However, it is not clear whether NF-?B activation is critical for phagocytosis when Staphylococcus aureus is the pathogen. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we investigated whether NF-?B cascade genes are altered in a mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) when the cells were stimulated to activate a host innate immune response against live S. aureus or heat-inactivated S. aureus (HISA). NF-?B cascade genes such as Nf?b1, Nf?biz, Nf?bie, Rel, Traf1 and Tnfaip3 were up-regulated by all treatments at one hour after incubation. NF-?B play an important role in activating phagocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells infected with S. aureus. Inhibition of NF-?B significantly blocked phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled S. aureus and decreased the expression of NF?B1, IL1?, IL1? and TLR2 in this cell line. Our results demonstrate that S. aureus may activate the NF-?B pathway and that NF-?B activation is required for phagocytosis of S. aureus by macrophages.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798100","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.842918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.722734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.66664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"TLR 2","weight":0.622519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_2"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.600407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.584919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.350172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.306358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Fluorescent labelling","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_labelling"},{"name":"Omnipresence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipresence"}]}
