{"id":25733,"title":"[Value of Fatty acids in formation of thrombotic status in patients with ischemic heart disease].","abstract":"Interrelation between fatty acids and platelet aggregation has been a subject of interest for cardiologists in the terms of thrombogenic status. In order to study this problem we observed 42 patients with ischemic heart disease and 30 healthy persons. In patients we found elevation of arachidonic acid and lowering of docosahexaenic acid levels. Hypoxemic assay revealed in these patients lowering of prostacyclin and antithrombin III levels. In the pathogenesis of disturbances of platelet aggregation in patients with ischemic heart disease alteration of structure of platelets with increased quantity of phosphatidyl ethanolamine and corresponding change of thrombocyte asymmetry resulted in conformational reorganization of proteins and lipids.
