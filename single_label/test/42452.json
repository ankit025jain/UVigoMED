{"id":42452,"title":"Profile of patients with incidentally detected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (IDNAFLD) in coastal eastern India.","abstract":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the commonest hepatic problem in both developed and developing countries. This study was conducted to delineate the clinical profile of incidentally detected NAFLD patients.A retrospective analysis of clinical, biochemical and histological parameters was performed for 632 patients in whom fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography during 2006-2010. Every patient's clinical presentation, history, liver function tests, blood sugar, lipid profile, ultrasonogram, histology and other relevant investigations were analyzed. Patients referred for transaminitis or overt chronic liver disease were excluded.Out of 632 consecutive NAFLD patients, 484 (76.6%) were males and 148 (23.4%) were females. Mean age of our patients was 42.44 +/- 10.18 years. Their mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.14 +/- 3.38 kg/m2. Obesity (BMI > 25), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance were present in 61.7%, 15.2%, 19.8%, 62.0%, 40.0%, and 54.4% patients, respectively. SGOT and SGPT were elevated in 38.29% and 55.1% patients, respectively. The common primary diseases for which these patients sought consultation were non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) (54.5%) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (29.4%). Of the 64 patients who underwent liver biopsy, one-fourth had definite NASH while one-third patients had fibrosis.In India, incidentally detected NAFLD (IDNAFLD) patients are predominantly middle aged males, most of whom are not lean. Most of these patients seek consultation for functional bowel disease.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851523","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.866133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.863895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.720704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"India","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"}]}
