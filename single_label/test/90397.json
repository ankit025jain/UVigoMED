{"id":90397,"title":"Improving care of patients with metastatic spinal cord compression.","abstract":"Metastatic spinal cord compression is a feature of advanced cancer and the incidence is likely to increase alongside improved survival rates. Patients with spinal cord compression have complex physical, psychological and social care needs. This article describes a multidisciplinary project aimed at improving the care provided to newly diagnosed patients who were admitted to a regional cancer centre for radiotherapy. The project used a range of approaches to measure care, develop and implement interventions, and evaluate outcomes. Aspects of care reviewed in the project included mobilisation, medications including steroids and thrombo-prophylaxis, bowel management, patient priorities and concerns, discharge planning and early detection.
