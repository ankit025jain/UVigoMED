{"id":88896,"title":"Dynamic versus static reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament for recurrent lateral patellar dislocation.","abstract":"To compare clinical and radiological outcomes of static and dynamic medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction techniques.In a retrospective, matched-paired, cohort analysis, 30 patients surgically treated for recurrent lateral patellar dislocation were divided into two groups of 15 patients matched for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The static technique group underwent rigid fixation of the gracilis tendon at the anatomic femoral MPFL insertion and the superomedial border of the patella; the dynamic technique group underwent detachment of the gracilis tendon at the pes anserinus with fixation to the proximal medial patellar margin via tunnel transfer obliquely through the patella. Kujala, Lysholm, and Tegner scores; pain level; and pre- and postoperative radiographic changes of patellar height, patellar tilt, and bisect offset were compared.No significant between-group differences were found in mean Kujala, Tegner, Lysholm, or visual analogue scale scores or radiographic parameters. One case of resubluxation was observed in the dynamic group. All but one patient in each group would have been willing to undergo the procedure again.Both techniques provided satisfactory short-term outcomes.III.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781275","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.625395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.543703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.219296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Gracilis muscle","weight":0.210525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracilis_muscle"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.149696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Pes anserinus (leg)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pes_anserinus_(leg)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Pes (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pes_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
