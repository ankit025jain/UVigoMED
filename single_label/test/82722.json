{"id":82722,"title":"Effect of reducing acid etching time on bond strength to noncarious and caries-affected primary and permanent dentin.","abstract":"The purpose was to evaluate the effect of acid etching time on the bond strength of a simplified etch-and-rinse adhesive system to noncarious and caries-affected dentin of primary and permanent teeth.Twenty-four extracted primary and permanent teeth were divided into three groups, according to the acid etching time. Four teeth from each group were exposed to a microbiological caries-inducing protocol. After caries removal, noncarious and caries-affected dentin surfaces were etched with 37 percent phosphoric acid for five, 10, or 15 seconds prior to the application of Prime & Bond NT adhesive. Crowns were restored with resin composite and prepared for microtensile testing. Data were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (?=0.05).Higher bond strengths were obtained for noncarious dentin vs. caries-affected dentin for both primary and permanent teeth. Reducing the acid etching time from 15 to five seconds did not affect the bond strength to caries-affected or noncarious dentin in primary teeth. For permanent teeth, lower bond strength values were observed when the noncarious dentin was etched for five seconds, while no difference was seen between 10 and 15 seconds.For Prime & Bond NT, the etching of dentin for five seconds could be recommended for primary teeth, while 10 seconds would be the minimum time for permanent teeth.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553267","annotations":[{"name":"Phosphoric acid","weight":0.894315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.482929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.477849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.326876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Etching","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etching"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.154061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0628681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"New Testament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Glass etching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_etching"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bond strength","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_strength"}]}
