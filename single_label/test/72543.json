{"id":72543,"title":"Epigenetic modulators from \"The Big Blue\": a treasure to fight against cancer.","abstract":"Cancer remains a major public health problem in our society. The development of potent novel anti-cancer drugs selective for tumor cells is therefore still required. Deregulation of the epigenetic machinery including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs is a hallmark of cancer, which provides potential new therapeutic targets. Natural products or their derivatives represent a major class of anti-cancer drugs in the arsenal available to the clinician. However, regarding epigenetically active anti-cancer agents for clinics, the oceans represent a largely untapped resource. This review focuses on marine natural compounds with epigenetic activities and their synthetic derivatives displaying anti-cancer properties including largazole, psammaplins, trichostatins and azumamides.
