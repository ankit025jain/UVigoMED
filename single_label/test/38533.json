{"id":38533,"title":"The effects of dexmedetomidine on early stage renal functions in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac angiography using non-ionic contrast media: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on early stage renal function in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac angiography.60 pediatric patients between 6 and 72 months of age undergoing cardiac angiography were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups. The patients in both groups were administered 1 mg · kg(-1) ketamine, 1 mg · kg(-1) propofol as bolus and followed by 1 mg · kg(-1) · h(-1) ketamine and 50 ?g · kg(-1) · min(-1) propofol infusion. Additionally, a loading dose of 1 ?g · kg(-1) dexmedetomidine given over 10 min followed by 0.5 ?g · kg(-1) · h(-1) dexmedetomidine infusion to patients in group D. The patients were evaluated for NGAL, creatinine, renin, endothelin-1, TAS and TOS blood levels before the procedure and 6th and 24th h after the procedure. pRIFLE criteria were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study.According to pRIFLE criteria contrast-induced acute kidney injury developed in 3 (10%) of the patients in group D and 11 (36.7%) of the patients in group C (P = 0.029, risk ratio = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.084-0.88). In patients who developed CIN, Endothelin-1 levels in groups C and D were significantly higher than baseline levels at 6th, 24th and 6th h, respectively. Renin levels were significantly increased at 6th and 24 th( ) h in patients with CIN in both groups.Dexmedetomidine may be beneficial in protecting against contrast-induced nephropathy during pediatric angiography by preventing the elevation of vasoconstrictor agents such as plasma endothelin-1 and renin.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
