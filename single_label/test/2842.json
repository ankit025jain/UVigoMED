{"id":2842,"title":"Anterior segment optical coherence tomography parameters in phacomorphic angle closure and mature cataracts.","abstract":"To describe anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) parameters in phacomorphic angle closure eyes, mature cataract eyes, and their fellow eyes, and identify those parameters that could be used to differentiate phacomorphic angle closure eyes from those with mature cataract and no phacomorphic angle closure.In this cross-sectional study, a total of 33 phacomorphic angle closure subjects and 34 control patients with unilateral mature cataracts were enrolled. All patients underwent AS-OCT imaging and A-scan biometry of both eyes. Anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber area (ACA), iris thickness, iris curvature, lens vault (LV), and angle parameters, including angle opening distance (AOD750) and trabecular-iris space area (TISA750), were measured in qualified images using customized software and compared among eyes with phacomorphic angle closure, mature cataract eyes, and their fellow eyes.There was no significant difference in axial length among the four groups. Phacomorphic angle closure had the smallest angle (AOD750, TISA750) and anterior chamber parameters (ACD, ACA, anterior chamber width) and the greatest LV among the groups. This pattern was similar when comparing fellow eyes of mature cataract patients and fellow eyes of phacomorphic angle closure. Anterior chamber area less than 18.62 mm(2), ACD less than 2.60 mm, LV greater than 532.0 ?m, and AOD750 less than 0.218 mm had the highest odds ratios (ORs) for distinguishing fellow eyes of phacomorphic angle closure versus fellow eyes of mature cataracts, with OR values of 9.90, 8.31, 7.91, and 7.91, respectively. Logistic regression showed that ACA less than 18.62 was the major parameter associated with fellow eyes of phacomorphic angle closure (OR = 10.96, P < 0.001).Anterior chamber depth, ACA, AOD750, and LV are powerful indicators in differentiating phacomorphic angle closure eyes from those with mature cataract and their fellow eyes.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335976","annotations":[{"name":"Optics","weight":0.574841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.388493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.373388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.10245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Biostatistics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Automatic call distributor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_call_distributor"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Custom software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_software"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Ford AOD transmission","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_AOD_transmission"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
