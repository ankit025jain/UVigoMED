{"id":62475,"title":"The role of body mass index in survival outcome for lymphoma patients: US intergroup experience.","abstract":"The role of body mass index (BMI) in survival outcomes is controversial among lymphoma patients. We evaluated the association between BMI at study entry and failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) in three phase III clinical trials, among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).A total of 537, 730 and 282 patients with DLBCL, HL and FL were included in the analysis. Baseline patient and clinical characteristics, treatment received and clinical outcomes were compared across BMI categories.Among patients with DLBCL, HL and FL, the median age was 70, 33 and 56; 29%, 29% and 37% were obese and 38%, 27% and 37% were overweight, respectively. Age was significantly different among BMI groups in all three studies. Higher BMI groups tended to have more favorable prognosis factors at study entry among DLBCL and HL patients. BMI was not associated with clinical outcome with P-values of 0.89, 0.30 and 0.40 for FFS, and 0.64, 0.67 and 0.09 for OS, for patients with DLBCL, HL and FL, respectively. The association remains non-significant after adjusting for other clinical factors in the Cox model. A subset analysis of males with DLBCL treated on R-CHOP revealed no differences in FFS (P = 0.48) or OS (P = 0.58).BMI was not significantly associated with clinical outcomes among patients with DLBCL, HD or FL, in three prospective phase III clinical trials. The findings contradict some previous reports of similar investigations. Further work is required to understand the observed discrepancies.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567515","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.629491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.121041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"537","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/537"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"730","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/730"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Ordnance Survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey"},{"name":"Intergroups in the European Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergroups_in_the_European_Parliament"},{"name":"Three-phase","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Hodgkins, Illinois","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkins,_Illinois"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
