{"id":70817,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for integrating MRI into breast cancer screening for women at high risk.","abstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for women at high risk for breast cancer. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies involving MRI.Using a microsimulation model, we generated life histories under different risk profiles, and assessed the impact of screening on quality-adjusted life-years, and lifetime costs, both discounted at 3%. We compared 12 screening strategies combining annual or biennial MRI with mammography and clinical breast examination (CBE) in intervals of 0.5, 1, or 2 years vs without, and reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).Based on an ICER threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy for women at 25% lifetime risk was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every year from age 30 to 74, yielding ICER $58,400 (compared to biennial MRI alone). At 50% lifetime risk and with 70% reduction in MRI cost, the recommended strategy was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$84,400). At 75% lifetime risk, the recommended strategy is biennial MRI combined with mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$62,800).The high costs of MRI and its lower specificity are limiting factors for annual screening schedule of MRI, except for women at sufficiently high risk.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137022","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.679671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.604608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.585106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Breast self-examination","weight":0.47031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_self-examination"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.395843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.388165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.312081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"ICER","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICER"},{"name":"Microsimulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsimulation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Order of the British Empire","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Stagger (aviation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagger_(aviation)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Biennial plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biennial_plant"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Discounting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounting"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Quality-adjusted life year","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"}]}
