{"id":87738,"title":"Rotational performance and corneal astigmatism correction during cataract surgery: aspheric toric intraocular lens versus aspheric nontoric intraocular lens with opposite clear corneal incision.","abstract":"To compare the astigmatism-reducing effect of an aspheric toric intraocular lens (IOL) and an aspheric nontoric IOL with an opposite clear corneal incision (OCCI) in cataract surgery.Vienna Institute for Research in Ocular Surgery, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria.Prospective randomized clinical study.Patients with low to moderate corneal astigmatism scheduled for cataract surgery received an aspheric toric IOL (Lentis L-312T) or an aspheric nontoric IOL (Lentis L-312) combined with an OCCI. Keratometry and corneal tomography were performed 1 hour, 1 week, 3 months and 9 months postoperatively. Postoperative residual astigmatism was measured using an autorefractor. Rotational toric IOL stability was analyzed using retroillumination photography.Fifty-five patients were included. Three months postoperatively, the mean reduction in corneal astigmatism was 0.67 diopter (D) ± 0.58 (SD) in the toric group and 0.18 ± 0.52 D in the nontoric-OCCI group. The mean uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.29 ± 0.30 logMAR and 0.09 ± 0.18 logMAR, respectively (P=.02). The mean refractive astigmatism was 1.02 ± 0.54 D and 0.68 ± 0.52 D, respectively (P=.05). One hour, 3 months, and 9 months postoperatively, the mean absolute IOL misalignment of toric IOLs was 4.99 ± 4.66 degrees, 13.59 ± 11.29 degrees, and 19.90 ± 14.48 degrees, respectively.The toric IOL tended to rotate significantly postoperatively. Visual acuity was good in both groups. Residual refractive cylinder was significantly lower in the toric IOL group.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996893","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.873017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Autorefractor","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorefractor"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.727484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.513335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.509956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.449282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.360723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Aspheric lens","weight":0.132628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspheric_lens"},{"name":"Vienna","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Toric lens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_lens"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0113497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"}]}
