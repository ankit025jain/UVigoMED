{"id":85963,"title":"Axl-altered microRNAs regulate tumorigenicity and gefitinib resistance in lung cancer.","abstract":"The involvement of Axl kinase in non-small cell lung cancer's (NSCLC) acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib or erlotinib has been identified recently, but the mechanism by which Axl contributes to TKI resistance is largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress gene expression and their critical role in tumorigenesis has been implicated. To investigate the role of miRNAs in the Axl-mediated acquired gefitinib resistance, we examined the Axl-mediated miRNA changes in gefitinib-resistant lung cancers. A panel of Axl kinase-altered miRNAs was identified. In this study, we validate and report that miR-374a and miR-548b modulated by Axl have essential roles in cell cycle arrest, gefitinib-induced apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration and tumorigenesis of gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting Wnt5a and CCNB1 genes, respectively. Of clinical significance, high expression of Axl and miR-374a and low expression of miR-548b are associated with poor disease-free survival postoperatively. These findings indicate that the modulation of specific miRNAs may provide a therapeutic target to treat or reverse gefitinib resistance in NSCLC with high expression of Axl in the future.
