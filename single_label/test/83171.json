{"id":83171,"title":"Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia associated with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.","abstract":"Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is a well-characterized oral complication of systemic therapy with bisphosphonates. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia was observed in some of the lesions. Because podoplanin expression has been linked to malignant lesions of the oral mucosa, we aimed to investigate podoplanin expression in the pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. We analyzed archival paraffin- and plastic-embedded specimens from BRONJ using both conventional and immunohistochemical (AE1/AE3, D2-40) staining methods. Eleven out of seventeen BRONJ cases showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. All these cases were positive for AE1/AE3 and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia displayed a strong basal and parabasal reaction against podoplanin. The podoplanin expression in pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia in BRONJ specimens should not be considered a sign of malignancy. We discuss the current and possible future roles of surgical pathologists in diagnosing morphological changes associated with the development and therapy of BRONJ lesions.
