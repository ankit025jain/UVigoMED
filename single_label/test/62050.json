{"id":62050,"title":"Quality of life of women with lower limb swelling or lymphedema 3-5 years following endometrial cancer.","abstract":"To quantitatively assess and compare the quality of life (QoL) of women with a self-reported diagnosis of lower limb lymphedema (LLL), to women with lower limb swelling (LLS), and to women without LLL or LLS following treatment for endometrial cancer.1399 participants in the Australian National Endometrial Cancer Study were sent a follow-up questionnaire 3-5 years after diagnosis. Women were asked if they had experienced swelling in the lower limbs and, if so, whether they had received a diagnosis of lymphedema by a health professional. The 639 women who responded were categorized as: Women with LLL (n=68), women with LLS (n=177) and women without LLL or LLS (n=394). Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear models were used to compare women's physical and mental QoL by LLL status.On average, women were 65 years of age and 4 years after diagnosis. Women with LLL had clinically lower physical QoL (M=41.8, SE=1.4) than women without LLL or LLS (M=45.1, SE=0.8, p=.07), however, their mental QoL was within the normative range (M=49.6; SE=1.1 p=1.0). Women with LLS had significantly lower physical (M=41.0, SE=1.0, p=.003) and mental QoL (M=46.8; SE=0.8, p<.0001) than women without LLL or LLS (Mental QoL: M=50.6, SE=0.8).Although LLL was associated with reductions in physical QoL, LLS was related to reductions in both physical and mental QoL 3-5 years after cancer treatment. Early referral to evidence-based lymphedema programs may prevent long-term impairments to women's QoL.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631452","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.64796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.477511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.442696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.263867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.165778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.0739124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"M50 motorway (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M50_motorway_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Generalized linear model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Linear model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model"},{"name":"639","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/639"},{"name":"394","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/394"},{"name":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory"},{"name":"1399","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1399"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"FAA airport categories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA_airport_categories"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Australian National Railways Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Railways_Commission"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"SE postcode area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SE_postcode_area"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"M49 motorway","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M49_motorway"},{"name":"M46 Patton","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M46_Patton"}]}
