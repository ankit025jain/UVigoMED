{"id":53631,"title":"[The effect of vitamin D on pregnancy].","abstract":"Vitamin D is a steroid hormone which plays an essential role in regulation of calcium metabolism. Many recent studies suggest that vitamin D is taking part in regulation of numerous physiological processes-glucose and neural metabolism, cardiovascular and sexual systems. Normal plasma levels of Vitamin D3 are needed for physiological development of pregnancy, normal skeletal mineralization of the fetal skeleton and lactation. Deficiency of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of serious complications like gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505636","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.889788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Steroid hormone","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone"},{"name":"Lactation","weight":0.831245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.695259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.567157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Calcium metabolism","weight":0.497304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_metabolism"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Mineralization (biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralization_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
