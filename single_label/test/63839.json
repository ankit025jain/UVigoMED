{"id":63839,"title":"[A case of jejunum cancer diagnosed by anemia].","abstract":"The patient was an 85-year-old woman who was referred to a nearby clinic complaining of shortness of breath. Blood test showed anemia, and she was referred to our hospital for identification of the source of bleeding. Upper and lower endoscopy were performed and revealed no abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) was performed and showed a >7- cm thickening in the wall of her small intestine. The presence of small bowel cancer was suspected. Oral double-balloon endoscopy was performed and showed a near-circumferential ulcerative lesion in the jejunum that was causing small bowel stenosis. A biopsy yielded a diagnosis of signet-ring cell carcinoma. We performed a partial resection of the patient's jejunum. The histopathological diagnosis of the resected specimen (according to the Union for International Cancer Control [UICC]TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, seventh edition) was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, T2 (MP), N0, H0, P0, stage I. 7 months after surgery, the patient is alive without recurrence. The incidence of small intestinal cancer is generally reported to be 1% to 2% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. We report a rare case in which cancer of the small intestine was identified during investigation of anemia.
