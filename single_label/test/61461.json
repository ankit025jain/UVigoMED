{"id":61461,"title":"Musculoskeletal applications of PET/MR.","abstract":"To overcome each limitation of morphological and functional imaging procedures, hybrid imaging systems have been developed and introduced into clinical routine. It has been increasingly discussed whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be an appropriate alternative for computed tomography (CT). The major advantage of positron emission tomography (PET)/MR consists of combined metabolic and anatomical information in a single imaging session that provides superior soft tissue characterization of MRI over CT. Until now, fusion image has been effectively utilized in oncologic indications. Because biopsy cannot be replaced by images for definite diagnosis, fusion imaging may be more efficient for staging based on nodal spread or metastases rather than the diagnosis of primary tumor, and it can be proficient for treatment response or postoperative assessment. This review describes mainly oncologic and nontumorous conditions among the musculoskeletal applications of PET/MR.
