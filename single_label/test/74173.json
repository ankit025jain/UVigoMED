{"id":74173,"title":"Aggressive angiomyxoma: swirled configuration on ultrasound and MR imaging.","abstract":"Aggressive angiomyxoma is a rare, myofibroblastic tumour, of pelvi-perineum of young women. It is a slow growing, low grade neoplasm with a high risk of recurrence following initial resection. Aggressive angiomyxoma is often clinically misdiagnosed because of its variable presentation as a soft tissue mass of the vulva, perianal region, buttock or pelvis. It displays translevator extension with growth around the perineal structures. Fewer than 150 cases have been reported in the literature since 1983. Imaging is important to determine the extent of the lesion. We present layered configuration of the mass on ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a 40 years old woman with a left pelvi- perineal mass since 5 years. Histapathology after excision gave a diagnosis of Aggressive Angiomyxoma.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864615","annotations":[{"name":"Vulva","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.794664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.787412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.648461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.391362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.262983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.108928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"}]}
