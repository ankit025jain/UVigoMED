{"id":52252,"title":"A quantitative relaxometric version of the ELISA test for the measurement of cell surface biomarkers.","abstract":"Quantitative measurement of marker expression in diseased cells is still a topic of considerable interest and different methodologies are currently under intense scrutiny. This work aims at developing an in?vitro diagnostic method based on the release of paramagnetic species from relaxometrically \"silent\" liposomes operated by the action of a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) previously targeted to the epitope of interest. The released paramagnetic species causes an increase of the longitudinal water proton relaxation rate proportional to the number of PLA2 bound to the cell outer surface. The sensitivity of the herein proposed method, named R-ELISA, was attempted in the detection of folate receptor expression on human ovarian cancer cells by functionalizing PLA2 with folic acid. Receptor/cell number of 8.3Ã—10(5) has been measured on IGROV-1 cells. The R-ELISA assay can detect nanomolar cell suspension receptor concentrations and has been validated by well-established spectrofluorimetric procedures.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615977","annotations":[{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.624192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.579542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.551982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Phospholipase A2","weight":0.479937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_A2"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.430481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Crust (geology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0864874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Paramagnetism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Relaxation technique","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_technique"}]}
