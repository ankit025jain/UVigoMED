{"id":88112,"title":"Menin regulates spinal glutamate-GABA balance through GAD65 contributing to neuropathic pain.","abstract":"Our previous work found that tumor suppressor menin potentiates spinal synaptic plasticity in the context of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic hypersensitivity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. We hereby assessed the role of menin in regulating the spinal balance between glutamate and GABA and its contribution to the pathological condition of nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity.In spared nerve injury induced C57BL/6 mice, mechanical withdrawal threshold was measured with von Frey filaments after intrathecal administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA) of MEN1 or/and subcutaneous histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to control the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65). Immunoblotting and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to detect the level of protein expression and spinal glutamate and GABA, respectively.Genetic knockdown of spinal menin alleviated nerve injury evoked mechanical hypersensitivity, which was strongly associated with the alteration of the spinal level of GAD65 that resulted in an imbalance of glutamate/GABA ratio from the baseline ratio of 5.8 ± 0.9 (×10(-4)) to the peak value of 58.6 ± 11.8 (×10(-4)) at the day 14 after SNI (p < 0.001), which was reversed by MEN1 siRNA to 14.7 ± 2.1 (×10(-4)) at the day 14 after nerve injury (p < 0.01). In further, selective inhibitors of HDACs considerably reversed the ratio of spinal glutamate and GABA, and also alleviated the mechanical withdrawal threshold markedly.Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the contribution of the upregulated spinal menin to peripheral nerve injury induced neuropathic hypersensitivity by regulating glutamate-GABA balance through deactivating GAD65.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905306","annotations":[{"name":"Synaptic
