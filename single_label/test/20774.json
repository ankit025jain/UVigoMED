{"id":20774,"title":"Multi-drug resistant non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection in a non-HIV infected child.","abstract":"Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are widely dispersed in our environment. Pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections and disseminated infections are common clinical syndromes in immuno-compromised patients. NTM infections are frequently overlooked in developing countries like India withendemic TB due to non-specific clinical manifestations, unfamiliarity of clinicians with mycobacteria, and inadequacy of laboratory services. Here we report a case of multidrug resistant (MDR) pulmonary NTM infection in a non-HIV infected child and her response to therapy.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640348","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.79293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"India","weight":0.703857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.571318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.560168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.523267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.316327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.243262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontuberculous_mycobacteria"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Biological dispersal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_dispersal"}]}
