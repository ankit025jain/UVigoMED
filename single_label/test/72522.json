{"id":72522,"title":"Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and Bcl-2 in breast cancer and their relationship with triple-negative disease.","abstract":"Carcinogenesis is a multistep process with many factors being involved. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Bcl-2 expression in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and, also whether any differences exist between TNBC and non-TNBC patients in relation with these two parameters.This study included 50 patients with pathologically diagnosed TNBC and followed up at the Medical Oncology Clinic of Antalya Education and Research Hospital between 2008 and 2010. Thirty non-TNBC patients composed the control group. COX-2 and Bcl-2 expression was immunohistochemically investigated in both patient groups.COX-2 expression was positive in 26 (86.7%) of non-TNBC and 18 (90%) of TNBC patients (p=0.722). Compared with non-TNBC, TNBC correlated with higher Bcl-2 expression (p=0.005). Of the non-TBNC patients 86.7% and 50% of TNBC patients showed Bcl-2 expression. When Bcl-2 and COX-2 expression were considered together, a significant difference was found between the two groups (p=0.021).This study showed that increased COX-2 expression correlated with Bcl-2 expression both in TNBC and non-TNBC patients. Analysis of coexpression of Bcl- 2 and COX-2 may be meaningful for deciding treatment strategies for TNBC. Treatment strategies targeting Bcl-2 and COX-2 seem to be promising for this aggressive disease with no specific treatment.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965402","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.849646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.741366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.702871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.388198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Antalya","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antalya"},{"name":"TNBC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNBC"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"}]}
