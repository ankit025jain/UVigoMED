{"id":43176,"title":"Statins and hepatitis C virus infection: an old therapy with new scope.","abstract":"Although their safety and efficacy have been extensively demonstrated, significant underutilization of statins is frequently seen in clinical practice for fears of hepatotoxicity. Research has not only shown statins' safety in patients with various forms of liver disease but also revealed the great benefits conferred by such therapy among liver disease patients. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not an exception. In fact, evidence has pointed to a dysmetabolic syndrome in HCV-infected patients, which places them at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and makes statins a life-saving therapy with excellent efficacy. Furthermore, statins have shown anti-HCV proliferative effects and other beneficial roles in different aspects of liver health, making them excellent drugs with minimal risks. In this review, we have discussed the newly described dysmetabolic syndrome associated with HCV infection, statins safety and efficacy in patients with chronic liver disease with special emphasis on HCV patients, the anti-HCV-proliferative effects of statins and finally, the benefits of statin therapy in other aspects of chronic liver disease.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24805786","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.845879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.229684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
