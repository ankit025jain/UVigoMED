{"id":68741,"title":"Association of mode of delivery with urinary incontinence and changes in urinary incontinence over the first year postpartum.","abstract":"To examine the association between vaginal or cesarean delivery and urinary incontinence (UI) and identify the trend in the change in UI within the first 12 months postpartum.This was a prospective longitudinal study of 330 of 749 women who completed a UI questionnaire and a personal characteristics questionnaire over five visits in a medical center.The vaginal delivery group had a significant higher prevalence of any UI at 4-6 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 months (29.1-40.2% vaginal compared with 14.2-25.5% cesarean); stress urinary incontinence (SUI) at 4-6 weeks and 3 and 12 months (15.9-25.4% vaginal compared with 6.4-15.6% cesarean); and moderate or severe UI at 3-5 days, 4-6 weeks, and 6 months (7.9-18.5% vaginal compared with 4.3-11.3% cesarean); and a significant higher score for interference in daily life at 3-5 days and 4-6 weeks (1.0, 0.7 vaginal compared with 0.7, 0.4 cesarean) compared with those in the cesarean delivery group. Prevalence increased for any UI, SUI, and slight UI (all P<.02) and daily life interference score decreased (P=.02) for women who had a vaginal delivery through 1 year postpartum.Vaginal delivery was associated with higher UI prevalence that persisted for 1 year postpartum, but there was no association with interference in daily life after 6 weeks postpartum. Variation was observed in UI changes within the first year in the vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery groups.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499754","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.737445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.722715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.477849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.462611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.434985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.411332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.359644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.177717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"749","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/749"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"925","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/925"},{"name":"918","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/918"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"311 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/311_(band)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
