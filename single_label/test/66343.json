{"id":66343,"title":"Current status of robotic and laparoscopic techniques in radical cystectomy and diversion procedures for bladder cancer: review.","abstract":"Across the world there has been an increased interest in minimally invasive approaches in extirpative and reconstructive surgery for bladder cancer. Minimally invasive approaches i.e. robotic and pure laparoscopic radical cystectomy have the greatest advantage of reduced blood loss, postoperative pain, quicker recovery of bowel function and earlier convalescence. Compared to established open techniques, there have been increasing reports of equivalent oncologic out comes and reduced complication rates in short and intermediate follow-ups. There have been several reports on urinary diversions achieved through minimal invasion and there is increasing interest to perform with robotic assistance. This review aims to review the currently published literature, technical aspects of the procedure, perioperative, oncologic and functional outcomes.
