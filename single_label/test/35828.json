{"id":35828,"title":"[Determination of the critical time point for efficacy of L-arginine infusion therapy in a case of MELAS with frequent stroke-like episodes].","abstract":"MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is the most representative subtype of mitochondrial diseases. Administration of L-arginine (L-Arg) or a precursor of nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed as a promising medication for MELAS because one of the pathophysiological mechanisms is supposedly a decreased capacity for NO-dependent vasodilation. We experienced a girl with MELAS and frequent stroke-like episodes who was treated with L-Arg infusion. We evaluated the efficacy of L-Arg infusion therapy based on whether her headache and nausea were disappeared and neurological symptoms were improved within 24 hours of L-Arg administration. L-Arg infusions were effective in all four episodes when the treatment was started within 4 hours of the onset of stroke-like episodes. On the other hand, the infusion was effective in only one out of five episodes when the medication was delayed by more than 4 hours after the onset. Furthermore, the early administration of L-Arg resulted in better outcomes regarding new lesions determined by brain MRI. Our data suggest that L-Arg infusion may be most effective when it is started within 4 hours of the onset of neurological symptoms in the acute phase of MELAS. The study of a large number of episodes in many patients will be needed to determine the critical time point of L-Arg administration after the onset of the acute phase of MELAS.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620430","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Lactic acidosis","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.793414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.757844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Acidosis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.443088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"MELAS syndrome","weight":0.0602563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MELAS_syndrome"},{"name":"Mitochondrial disease","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_disease"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Mitochondrial myopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_myopathy"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
