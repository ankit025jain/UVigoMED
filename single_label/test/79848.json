{"id":79848,"title":"[Investigation of vectors and reservoirs in an acute Chagas outbreak due to possible oral transmission in Aguachica, Cesar, Colombia].","abstract":"Colombia recorded 11 cases of acute Chagas disease and 80 cases of oral contamination with Trypanosoma cruzi. The current study analyzes the entomological and parasitological characteristics of the outbreak in Aguachica, Cesar Department, in 2010. An interdisciplinary group of health professionals and regional university personnel conducted the laboratory tests in the patients and the investigation of the transmission focus. Eleven cases of acute Chagas diseases were detected in a single family in a dwelling with domiciliated triatomines and Rhodnius pallescens, Pantrongylus geniculatus, Eratyrus cuspidatus, and two Didelphis marsupialis opossums infected with T. cruzi in Attalea butyracea and Elaeis oleifera palm trees in the urban area of Aguachica. The study analyzes the role of R. pallescens and palm trees in the wild cycle of T. cruzi and in oral transmission of Chagas disease. Sporadic incursions by wild R. pallescens, P. geniculatus, and E. cuspidatus from the nearby palm trees into human dwellings may cause increasingly frequent outbreaks of oral Chagas disease.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896050","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.763571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.566026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.553594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.459177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Arecaceae","weight":0.320279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae"},{"name":"Entomology","weight":0.297132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"House","weight":0.215637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Oil palm","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_palm"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.191351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Oral tradition","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"University","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Opossum","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opossum"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Trypanosoma cruzi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Common opossum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_opossum"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Dwelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwelling"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Rhodnius","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodnius"}]}
