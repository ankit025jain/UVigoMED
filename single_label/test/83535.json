{"id":83535,"title":"[Experimental study of skin wound healing with epidermal stem cells from human hypertrophic scar in nude mice].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of epidermal stem cells from human hypertrophic scar (HS-ESCs) on the skin wound healing in nude mice.40 mice were randomly divided into two groups as experimental group (n = 20) and control group (n = 20). Wounds, 1 cm in diameters, were made on every mouse back. The wounds were treated with HS-ESCs and erythromycin ointment in experimental group, or only with erythromycin ointment in control group. The wound healing was observed during the following 14 days. The expression of collagen-I, collagen-III, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) , transforming growth factor (TGFbeta1, and TGFbeta2) were studied.The wound healing time in the experimental group was (20.8 +/- 0.84) d, which was (25.6 +/- 0.89) d in the control group. HE staining revealed that the extent of vascularization in the experimental group was 11.60 +/- 0.55, while it was 8.04 +/- 0.33 in the control group. Immunochemistry analysis showed the expression of collagen-I, collagen-III, EGF, FGF2, TGFbeta1, and TGFbeta2 in the experimental group were significantly higher, compared with those in control group (P < 0.05).HS-ESCs may promote wound healing through enhancement of the vascularization of the wound tissue and the expression of growth factors.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322578","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Basic fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.750883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.577993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.454502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Erythromycin","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythromycin"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
