{"id":26673,"title":"Overexpression of junctophilin-2 does not enhance baseline function but attenuates heart failure development after cardiac stress.","abstract":"Heart failure is accompanied by a loss of the orderly disposition of transverse (T)-tubules and a decrease of their associations with the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR). Junctophilin-2 (JP2) is a structural protein responsible for jSR/T-tubule docking. Animal models of cardiac stresses demonstrate that down-regulation of JP2 contributes to T-tubule disorganization, loss of excitation-contraction coupling, and heart failure development. Our objective was to determine whether JP2 overexpression attenuates stress-induced T-tubule disorganization and protects against heart failure progression. We therefore generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific JP2 overexpression (JP2-OE). Baseline cardiac function and Ca(2+) handling properties were similar between JP2-OE and control mice. However, JP2-OE mice displayed a significant increase in the junctional coupling area between T-tubules and the SR and an elevated expression of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, although other excitation-contraction coupling protein levels were not significantly changed. Despite similar cardiac function at baseline, overexpression of JP2 provided significantly protective benefits after pressure overload. This was accompanied by a decreased percentage of surviving mice that developed heart failure, as well as preservation of T-tubule network integrity in both the left and right ventricles. Taken together, these data suggest that strategies to maintain JP2 levels can prevent the progression from hypertrophy to heart failure.
