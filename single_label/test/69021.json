{"id":69021,"title":"[Follow-up care - consequences of urinary diversion after bladder cancer].","abstract":"Radical cystectomy is the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Continent urinary diversions utilizing both small and large bowel are becoming more prominent: therefore, the postoperative follow-up has to focus on different aspects. In the first instance after radical cystectomy functional issues with respect to potential stenosis, post-void residual urine and micturition disorders are important. In the early phase the oncological follow-up aims to detect local, urethral and systemic recurrences and new data show the importance of the first 3 years after surgery. Long-term follow-up focuses on metabolic aspects, such as cobalamin or bile acid deficits, acidosis and disorders of calcium and bone metabolism. Follow-up care should consider specific complications of different types of urinary diversions; however to date standardized follow-up guidelines are lacking.
