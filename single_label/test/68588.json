{"id":68588,"title":"Improving CKD therapies and care: a National Dialogue.","abstract":"The Kidney Research National Dialogue, supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, asked the research and clinical communities to formulate and prioritize research objectives that would improve our understanding of kidney function and diseases. This commentary outlines the high-priority research objectives for CKD. The goal of these research objectives is to enhance knowledge to improve outcomes in people with CKD. Basic and translational research, longitudinal observations, and epidemiologic studies can each point to targets for intervention. Future interventions must be informed by data from well designed, large representative observational studies that include collection of genetic and phenotypic data as well as biospecimens. Interaction of genetic and environmental factors must be part of the analysis, including the influence of diet, comorbid conditions, and medication. The focus should be not only on slowing or preventing progression of CKD, but also on regression of disease to the greatest extent possible.
