{"id":55565,"title":"Anti-VEGF treatment patterns for neovascular age-related macular degeneration among medicare beneficiaries.","abstract":"To examine the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in clinical practice among patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Retrospective cohort study.Among 459 237 Medicare beneficiaries, we identified anti-VEGF treatment using claims for intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF medications with a supporting diagnosis of neovascular AMD. We used the cumulative incidence function to calculate the frequency of anti-VEGF treatments and treatment visits for neovascular AMD per treated eye in the first and second year after the initial anti-VEGF injection. We calculated the mean number of treatments and treatment visits per eye using the mean frequency function. Rates of discontinuation were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.The mean number of injections was 4.3 in the first year, with 58% of patients receiving 1-4 injections, 20% receiving 5-6 injections, and 22% receiving 7 or more injections. Among patients who received 7 or more injections during the first year, 31% received a comparable number during the second year, and 12% received no injections. Of patients who received 1-4 injections during the first year, 70% received no injections and 24% received 1-4 injections during the second year. Rates of anti-VEGF discontinuation were 57% within 12 months and 71% within 24 months.The frequency of anti-VEGF injections for neovascular AMD was lower than that recommended by large-scale clinical trials, and rates of discontinuation were high. National practice patterns in anti-VEGF therapy for patients with neovascular AMD do not reflect optimal treatment strategies suggested by recent clinical trial evidence.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857687","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.919684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.825112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.640401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.58549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.529115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.457677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.193233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.181242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Frequency response","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Beneficiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary"},{"name":"Optimal design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_design"}]}
