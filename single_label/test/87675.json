{"id":87675,"title":"An application of embryonic skin cells to repair diabetic skin wound: a wound reparation trail.","abstract":"Cell therapy has shown its power to promote diabetic chronic wound healing. However, problems of scar formation and loss of appendages have not yet been solved. Our study aims to explore the potential of using embryonic skin cells (ESkCs) to repair diabetic wounds. Circular wound was created on the back of the diabetic mice, and ESkCs stained with CM-DIL were transplanted into the wound. Wound area was recorded at the day 4, 7, 11, and 14 after transplantation. The tissue samples were obtained at week 1, 2, and 3, and the tissue sections were stained by transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1), TGF-?3, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and CD31. The new skin formed on the wound of the diabetic mice with ESkC treatment at week 1 but not on the wounds of the non-treatment group. The histological scores of diabetic group with ESkC treatment were significantly better than the non-treatment group (P?<?0.05). The fluorescence examination of CM-DIL and CD31 staining indicated that the ESkCs participated in the tissue regeneration, hair follicles formation, and angiogenesis. The expression of TGF-?1 and VEGF in ESkC-treated groups was noticeable in week 1 but disappeared in week 2. TGF-?3 was not expressed at week 1 but expressed markedly around hair follicles in week 2 in ESkC-treated groups. Our study demonstrated that ESkCs are capable of developing new skin with appendage restoration to repair the diabetic wounds.
