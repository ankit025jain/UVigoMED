{"id":65993,"title":"NADPH oxidase NOX4 supports renal tumorigenesis by promoting the expression and nuclear accumulation of HIF2?.","abstract":"Most sporadically occurring renal tumors include a functional loss of the tumor suppressor von Hippel Lindau (VHL). Development of VHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) relies upon activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-2? (HIF2?), a master transcriptional regulator of genes that drive diverse processes, including angiogenesis, proliferation, and anaerobic metabolism. In determining the critical functions for HIF2? expression in RCC cells, the NADPH oxidase NOX4 has been identified, but the pathogenic contributions of NOX4 to RCC have not been evaluated directly. Here, we report that NOX4 silencing in VHL-deficient RCC cells abrogates cell branching, invasion, colony formation, and growth in a murine xenograft model RCC. These alterations were phenocopied by treatment of the superoxide scavenger, TEMPOL, or by overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase or catalase. Notably, NOX4 silencing or superoxide scavenging was sufficient to block nuclear accumulation of HIF2? in RCC cells. Our results offer direct evidence that NOX4 is critical for renal tumorigenesis and they show how NOX4 suppression and VHL re-expression in VHL-deficient RCC cells are genetically synonymous, supporting development of therapeutic regimens aimed at NOX4 blockade.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755467","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","weight":0.916687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Manganese","weight":0.787966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.75542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.738829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.70374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"NADPH oxidase","weight":0.681095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.680616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.423266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.399136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.364764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.24212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Synonym (taxonomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)"},{"name":"VHL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHL"},{"name":"Scavenger (chemistry)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
