{"id":51882,"title":"HbA1c is associated with increased all-cause mortality in the first year after acute ischemic stroke.","abstract":"To assess the association between baseline HbA1c and the poor outcomes within 1 year after acute ischemic stroke.Acute ischemic stroke patients with HbA1c values at baseline (n ?=? 2186) were selected from the abnormal glucose regulation in patients with acute stroke across China study (ACROSS). Logistic regressions were performed to assess the association between HbA1c quartiles (<5.5% [37 mmol/mol], 5.5 to <6.1% [37 to <43 mmol/mol], 6.1 to <7.2% [43 to <55 mmol/mol], and ? 7.2% [? 55 mmol/mol]) and the poor outcomes within 1 year. Poor outcomes were defined as all-cause mortality (modified Rankin scale [mRS] ?=? 6) and poor functional outcome (mRS [2-6]).The risk for all-cause mortality was significantly increased in HbA1c level >5.5% [>37 mmol/mol] when compared to HbA1c quartile <5.5% [<37 mmol/mol] and dramatically increased to two to three times higher in the highest HbA1c quartile ? 7.2% [>55 mmol/mol] (1-year all-cause mortality model, odds ratios [ORs] were 1.07, 1.01, and 2.45, P for trend 0.009). After the further analysis with previous diabetes mellitus (DM) and post-stroke insulin use stratified, the risk of mortality was increased across the HbA1c levels (P for trend 0.020) and dramatically augmented in HbA1c ? 7.2% [>55 mmol/mol] in patients without a history of DM and without post-stroke insulin use.Elevated HbA1c (from 5.5% [37 mmol/mol]) presenting pre-stroke glycemia status has a significant trend in increasing the risk of 1-year all-cause mortality. HbA1c ? 7.2% (>55 mmol/mol) is an independent risk predictor for 1-year all-cause mortality after acute first-ever ischemic stroke. Such an association might be altered by glycometabolism status.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649851","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.517294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.346986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.252918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.250192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.177318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Modified Rankin Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Rankin_Scale"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Excel Saga","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excel_Saga"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Standard scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_scale"},{"name":"2180s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2180s"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Human enhancement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
