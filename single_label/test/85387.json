{"id":85387,"title":"Chest CT findings in EBUS-TBNA-proven anthracosis in enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.","abstract":"We demonstrate the multislice computed tomography (MSCT) findings of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)-proven hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement with signs of anthracosis.53 enlarged lymph nodes in 39 patients (28 male, 11 female) with EBUS-TBNA-confirmed anthracosis were analyzed retrospectively.The mean short axis diameter of the enlarged lymph nodes with signs of anthracosis was 13.7 ?mm. Lymph nodes most often showed an oval shape (84 ?%) and were well defined in 66 ?% of cases. Lymph node confluence was observed in 32 ?% of cases. Calcifications were documented in 24.5 ?% of cases. Contrast enhancement and fatty involution were seen seldom (3.8 ?%). Lymph node necrosis was not seen.Lymph node anthracosis may be found most often in enlarged, well defined lymph nodes with an oval shape, frequently associated with confluence and calcifications.","date":"2014-11-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955645","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Adenitis","weight":0.53413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenitis"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.470048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Hilum of lung","weight":0.46492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_of_lung"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.338059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Involution (mathematics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Coalworker's pneumoconiosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalworker's_pneumoconiosis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radiocontrast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocontrast"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Dystrophic calcification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophic_calcification"},{"name":"Oval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Confluence","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
