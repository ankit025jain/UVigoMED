{"id":45280,"title":"Vulvodynia and proctodynia treated with topical baclofen 5 % and palmitoylethanolamide.","abstract":"The prevalence of idiopathic vulvodynia and proctodynia is high. Pain management with anti-depressants and anti-epileptics may induce undesirable side effects. Therefore, topical baclofen cream and palmitoylethanolamide might be new therapeutic options.A 33-year-old woman with intractable chronic vulvar and anal pain had to abstain from sexual intercourse and could neither cycle nor sit for more than 5 min. The patient did not respond to standard treatments. We prescribed a combination of topical baclofen 5 % and palmitoylethanolamide 400 mg, three times daily. After 3 months her symptoms decreased more than 50 % and sexual intercourse was possible again without pain.Topical baclofen and palmitoylethanolamide can be a viable treatment option in chronic vulvodynia and proctodynia.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691823","annotations":[{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.763541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.651405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Vulvodynia","weight":0.584258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulvodynia"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.57953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.5758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.401999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.275612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Baclofen","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclofen"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0539708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Vulvar cancer","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulvar_cancer"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
