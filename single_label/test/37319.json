{"id":37319,"title":"Comparison between oscillometric and intra-arterial blood pressure measurements in ill preterm and full-term neonates.","abstract":"Conflicting data exist regarding the accuracy of the oscillometric method of blood pressure (BP) measurement in neonates. There is limited data regarding intra-arterial BP trends in neonates. We aimed to determine the accuracy of oscillometric BP measurements and to evaluate the BP distributions in ill neonates. A total of 1492 simultaneously obtained oscillometric and intra-arterial (umbilical arterial [UAC] or radial arterial) BP measurements were used for comparisons and 125,580 intra-arterial BP readings were used to the evaluate BP distribution. There was a statistically significant difference (P < .0001) between the oscillometric and radial mean arterial BP (MAP) 4.8 ± 9.8 mm Hg, systolic BP 8.3 ± 11.6 mm Hg, diastolic BP 4.3 ± 9.3 mm Hg and between the oscillometric and UAC systolic BP 5.2 ± 11.9 mm Hg and diastolic BP -0.8 ± 10.4 mm Hg. The MAP increased with increases in weight (35.3 ± 4.92 mm Hg/kg), post-menstrual age (-0.29 ± 1.41 mm Hg/week) and advanced gestational age at birth (13.12 ± 0.90 mm Hg/week). Oscillometric BP measurements are not equivalent to the intra-arterial (UAC or radial arterial) BP in ill neonates. The BP increases with increase in weight, gestational age at birth, and post-menstrual age in ill neonates.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503236","annotations":[{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.590611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.338922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.323762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.302835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.266487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.261876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"1492","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1492"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"580","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/580"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"User Account Control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control"}]}
