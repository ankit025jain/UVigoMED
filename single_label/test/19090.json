{"id":19090,"title":"Role of TNF in the altered interaction of dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis with host macrophages.","abstract":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persists within lung granulomas, despite being subjected to diverse stress conditions, including hypoxia. We hypothesized that the response of host phagocytes to Mtb experiencing hypoxia is radically altered and designed in vitro experiment to study this phenomenon. Hypoxia-stressed (Mtb-H) and aerobically grown Mtb (Mtb-A) were used to infect Rhesus Macaque Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (Rh-BMDMs) and the comparative host response to Mtb infection studied. Mechanistic insights were gained by employing RNAi. Mtb-H accumulated significantly lower bacterial burden during growth in Rh-BMDMs, concomitantly generating a drastically different host transcriptional profile (with only <2% of all genes perturbed by either infection being shared between the two groups). A key component of this signature was significantly higher TNF and apopotosis in Mtb-H- compared to Mtb-A-infected Rh-BMDMs. Silencing of TNF by RNAi reversed the significant control of Mtb replication. These results indicate a potential mechanism for the rapid clearance of hypoxia-conditioned bacilli by phagocytes. In conclusion, hypoxia-conditioned Mtb undergo significantly different interactions with host macrophages compared to Mtb grown in normoxia. These interactions result in the induction of the TNF signaling pathway, activation of apoptosis, and DNA-damage stress response. Our results show that Mtb-H bacilli are particularly susceptible to killing governed by TNF.
