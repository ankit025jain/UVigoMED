{"id":68787,"title":"Cardiorenal syndrome type 4: management.","abstract":"Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) type 4, or chronic renocardiac syndrome, has been defined as 'chronic abnormalities in renal function leading to cardiac disease' and recognizes the extreme burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is common and increasingly recognized as a risk factor for CVD. Although during the past 10 years CV morbidity and mortality have decreased markedly in the general population, their rates still remain high among CKD patients. For this reason, CKD patients should be evaluated thoroughly for CV risk factors which require an aggressive management, given the significant implications of CRS type 4 at both individual and societal level. We will review the management of the most important conventional and nonconventional CVD risk factors related to CKD.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496191","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.83149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.571845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.205318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
