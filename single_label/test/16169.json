{"id":16169,"title":"Mycobacterium mucogenicum infection following dacryocystorhinostomy and Crawford tube placement.","abstract":"Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections of the skin can be seen in cases of immunosuppression and/or traumatic implantation of contaminated objects. Surgical settings with appropriate sterilization techniques have been immune to these types of infections. We report a case of nosocomially derived infection from a sterile procedure.A woman in her 70s presented with a facial lesion after an ophthalmologic procedure that was discovered to be a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. It was successfully treated with oral antibiotics.Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new lesions arising after invasive procedures, even in immunocompetent patients in seemingly sterile settings.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054441","annotations":[{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.755009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.748303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.533261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Fomite","weight":0.510143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.460485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.24532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Dacryocystorhinostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacryocystorhinostomy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}]}
