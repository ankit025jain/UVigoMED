{"id":88263,"title":"Arthroscopic assisted percutaneous screw fixation of Bennett's fracture.","abstract":"Several techniques are used for fixation of Bennett's fractures. The aim of this study was to assess a technique of arthroscopic-assisted reduction and percutaneous cannulated screw fixation of Bennett's fractures. Seven patients (mean age 29 years) with three fractures Type I and four fractures Type II according to Gedda were operated under arthroscopic lavage, fluoroscopic screw fixation, and arthroscopic control of the joint reduction. Arthroscopy, showed satisfactory joint reduction in all cases. At 4.5 months, the mean pain score was 1 (0-4), QuickDASH 15 (0-61), and Kapandji score 9 (5-10). Compared to the contralateral side, first web opening was 86% (58-100), key pinch 73% (45-89), grip strength, and 85% (40-100). Four secondary displacements were noted, two of which had a step of more than 1 mm. Our results showed that the use of arthroscopy for percutaneous screw fixation of Bennett's fractures facilitates joint reduction but does not guarantee stability of fixation.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875520","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.482581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.321729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.242048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.223599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.211185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.178824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Arthroscopic lavage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopic_lavage"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Mechanical equilibrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Grip strength","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength"},{"name":"Bennetts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennetts"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
