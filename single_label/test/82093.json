{"id":82093,"title":"Bioinformatics analysis reveals significant genes and pathways to target for oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"The purpose of our study was to explore the molecular mechanisms in the process of oral squamous cells carcinoma (OSCC) development.We downloaded the affymetrix microarray data GSE31853 and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OSCC and normal tissues. Then Gene Ontology (GO) and Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) networks analysis was conducted to investigate the DEGs at the function level.A total 372 DEGs with logFC| >1 and P value < 0.05 were obtained , including NNMT, BAX, MMP9 and VEGF. The enriched GO terms mainly were associated with the nucleoplasm, response to DNA damage stimuli and DNA repair. PPI network analysis indicated that GMNN and TSPO were significant hub proteins and steroid biosynthesis and synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies were significantly dysregulated pathways.It is concluded that the genes and pathways identified in our work may play critical roles in OSCC development. Our data provides a comprehensive perspective to understand mechanisms underlying OSCC and the significant genes (proteins) and pathways may be targets for therapy in the future.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716969","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.911937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Ketone","weight":0.911436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.698891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.657002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.649698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.484376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Ketone bodies","weight":0.445754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone_bodies"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene Ontology","weight":0.174844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ontology"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.157137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Nucleoplasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoplasm"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Uploading and downloading","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uploading_and_downloading"},{"name":"Network theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Ontology","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"}]}
