{"id":65792,"title":"MALDI imaging on tissue microarrays identifies molecular features associated with renal cell cancer phenotype.","abstract":"To identify molecular features associated with clinico-pathological parameters in renal cell cancer.Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging was employed for a kidney cancer tissue microarray containing tissue samples from 789 patients for which clinical follow-up data were available.A comparison of mass spectrometric signals with clinico-pathological features revealed significant differences between papillary and clear cell renal cell cancer. Within the subgroup of clear cell RCC, statistical associations with tumor stage (seven signals, p<0.01 each), Fuhrman grade (seven signals, p<0.0001 each), and presence of lymph node metastases (10 signals, p<0.01 each) were found. In addition, the presence of one signal was significantly linked to shortened patient survival (p=0.0198).Our data pinpoint towards various molecules with potential relevance in renal cell cancer. They also demonstrate that the combination of the MALDI mass spectrometry imaging and large-scale tissue microarray platforms represents a powerful approach to identify clinically-relevant molecular cancer features.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778028","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.769445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.679848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.600454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization","weight":0.486183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.299525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.275612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.214558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"MALDI imaging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALDI_imaging"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
