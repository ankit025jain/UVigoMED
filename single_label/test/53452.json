{"id":53452,"title":"[Treatment of premature ovarian failure patients of Shen Yang deficiency syndrome by warming Shen, enhancing Yang, invigorating qi, and nourishing blood method combined artificial cycle therapy: a clinical observation].","abstract":"To observe the clinical efficacy of warming Shen, enhancing Yang, invigorating qi, and nourishing blood method (WSEYIQNBM) combined artificial cycle therapy in treatment of premature ovarian failure (POF) patients of Shen yang deficiency syndrome (SYDS).Totally 96 POF patients of SYDS were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group, 48 in each group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with WSEYIQNBM combined artificial cycle therapy, while those in the control group were treated with Western medicine artificial cycle therapy. One month constituted 1 course, a total of 3 courses. The menstruation and main symptoms were observed before and after treatment. Serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E2) were detected before and after treatment.The total effective rate was 85.43% in the treatment group, higher than that of the control group (79.17%, P < 0.05). Besides, better effect in improving Chinese medical symptoms was obtained in the treatment group (P < 0.05).POF patients' serum hormone levels and clinical symptoms could be improved by WSEYIQNBM combined artificial cycle therapy.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517061","annotations":[{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.923983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Menstruation","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.750099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.725549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.630688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.458524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.350429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.281163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.278967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.211204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Premature ovarian failure","weight":0.199893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ovarian_failure"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.164585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"}]}
