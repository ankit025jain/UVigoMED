{"id":23141,"title":"Meningococcal septic shock after IUD insertion, a case presentation.","abstract":"Neisseria meningitidis is a normal commensal of human mucous membranes that is no longer considered to be restricted to the nasopharynx. Due to the practice of oral sex, the mucous membranes of the cervix, urethra or anus have become a potential infection site for this bacterium. Inserting an intrauterine device (IUD), can alter the protective barrier of the endocervical mucosa, allowing for bacterial infection and systemic spread. We present a case report of a 40-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, spotting and fever after inserting an IUD and developed a fulminant septic shock. Blood cultures and cultures from ascites showed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis group Y. From our knowledge, there are a few cases presented in the literature of toxic shock syndrome after IUD insertion, caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus group A, but this is the first case of meningococcal sepsis after IUD insertion described. So, even though IUDs rarely cause significant infection, physicians should consider this device as a possible source in reproductive-age women with the clinical features of sepsis.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
