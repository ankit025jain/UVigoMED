{"id":33328,"title":"The prevalence and characteristics of intra-atrial right coronary artery anomaly in 9,284 patients referred for coronary computed tomography angiography.","abstract":"To determine the prevalence, radiologic patterns and clinical characteristics of intra-atrial right coronary artery (IARCA) among adult coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) population.We included 9,284 consecutive subjects who underwent CCTA at a single high-volume center. The presence of IARCA including the number, length and diameter of IARCA segments with accompanying atherosclerosis and coronary anomalies were evaluated. Additionally, clinical characteristics and midterm follow-up of IARCA patients were recorded.The IARCA prevalence was 0.15% (14/9,284) with 15 intra-atrial segments. The intra-atrial segment length ranged from 14 to 53 mm, and the mean diameter proximal to the entry site was 3.3 ± 0.7 mm. IARCA was more often associated with intramuscular course of the left anterior descending coronary artery (29% vs. 4%, p=0.001) and anomalous origin of the left circumflex artery from the right aortic sinus (14% vs. 0.3%, p=0.001) compared with non-IARCA cases. The majority of IARCA patients were women (86%) presenting with supraventricular arrhythmia (71%). Compared with computed tomographic population without IARCA, IARCA subjects were younger (60 ± 12 vs. 54 ± 14 years, p=0.037) and more often women (51% vs. 86%, p=0.013). At a mean of 20 months follow-up of IARCA patients there were no adverse cardiac events except for supraventricular tachycardia episodes occurring in 36% of subjects.IARCA occurs rarely and is often associated with additional coronary anomalies. The clinical profile of IARCA patients is most often represented by middle-aged women with supraventricular arrhythmia showing favorable midterm prognosis.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840476","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Circumflex branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.809608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.686122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Aortic sinus","weight":0.622055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_sinus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Right coronary artery","weight":0.52321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.477993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.399406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.381946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.277742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.205945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Supraventricular tachycardia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
