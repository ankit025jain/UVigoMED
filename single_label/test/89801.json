{"id":89801,"title":"Fracture dislocation of the finger joints.","abstract":"Fracture dislocations of the hand are difficult and often unforgiving injuries. Keys to treatment include early recognition, stable concentric reduction, and protected early active range of motion maintaining joint stability. The balance between stability and mobility is difficult to manage; therefore, surgeons need a wide array of treatments to tailor management to the specific fracture pattern. With appropriate treatment, residual stiffness and pain can be minimized. This Current Concepts review aims to provide up-to-date management for proximal interphalangeal, distal interphalangeal, and metacarpophalangeal joint fracture dislocations.
