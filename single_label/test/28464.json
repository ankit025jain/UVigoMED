{"id":28464,"title":"Drug resistant neuroleptic malignant syndrome and the role of electroconvulsive therapy.","abstract":"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is considered as a rare but potentially fatal complication of neuroleptic medications e.g.,antipsychotics, sedatives and anti emetics. It is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, an elevated creatine kinase level and autonomic instability. The syndrome often develops after the start of antipsychotic or a sudden increase in dosage of the neuroleptic medication or in states of dehydration. Treatment is mainly supportive and includes withdrawal of the neuroleptic medication and, possibly, administration of drugs such as dantrolene and bromocriptine. In rare cases where drugs treatment remains ineffective a trial of electroconvulsive therapy is being given. The case presented is a drug resistant case of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome where finally electroconvulsive therapy was effective.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864649","annotations":[{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Bromocriptine","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromocriptine"},{"name":"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Dantrolene","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dantrolene"},{"name":"Creatine","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine"},{"name":"Electroconvulsive therapy","weight":0.794137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Dehydration","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sedative","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Hypertonia","weight":0.678183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertonia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.523427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Dysautonomia","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"}]}
