{"id":90937,"title":"Intramedullary allograft fibula as a reduction and fixation tool for treatment of complex proximal humerus fractures with diaphyseal extension.","abstract":"In this study, we present a novel technique for reduction and fixation of complex, unstable proximal humerus fractures with diaphyseal extension with the assistance of fibula allograft. We treated 14 patients using this technique since 2009 and found that it improves the reduction and enhances fixation while making the surgical procedure technically more manageable, and allows for early postoperative motion. In the first part of this study, we describe in detail the indications and surgical technique applied to these fractures. In the second part, we review the clinical and radiographic outcomes of these patients. Using this new technique, we have achieved an excellent union rate with minimal incidence of complications when treating these challenging fractures.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561540","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.682684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.354541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.287874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.142607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"}]}
