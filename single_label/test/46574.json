{"id":46574,"title":"The combined use of serum neurotensin and IL-8 as screening markers for colorectal cancer.","abstract":"This pilot study aimed to determine the feasibility of serum neurotensin/IL-8 values being used as a screening tool for colorectal cancer. Fifty-six patients and 15 healthy controls were assigned to seven groups according to their disease entity based on theater records and histology report. Blood samples for neurotensin and IL-8 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There were no differences in the clinical and biochemical parameters of patients and controls. Group (p=0.003) and age (p=0.059, marginally significant) were independent predictors of neurotensin plasma values. Neurotensin (p=0.004) and IL-8 (p=0.029) differed between healthy and colorectal cancer patients. Neurotensin values differentiate the control group from all remaining groups. The value of plasma neurotensin ? 54.47 pg/ml at enrollment selected by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated a sensitivity of 77 %, specificity of 90 %, and an estimate of area under ROC curve (accuracy) of 85 % in predicting colorectal cancer. At enrollment, the value of plasma IL-8 ? 8.83 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 85 %, specificity 80 %, and an estimate of area under ROC curve (accuracy) of 81 % in predicting colorectal cancer. IL-8 should be used complementary to neurotensin due to its lower specificity. None of the colorectal cancer patients displayed a combination of high neurotensin and low IL-8 values (beyond cutoffs). It seems that a blood neurotensin/IL-8 system may be used as a screening tool for colorectal cancer, but much has to be done before it is validated in larger-scale prospective studies.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627130","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.786959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.641585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.623701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.543535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.499596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.306088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.211393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Neurotensin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotensin"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
