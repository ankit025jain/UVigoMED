{"id":65591,"title":"Serum fucosylated haptoglobin as a novel prognostic biomarker predicting high-Gleason prostate cancer.","abstract":"Fucosylation is an oligosaccharide modification associated with cancer and inflammation, which is catalyzed by fucosyltransferases. Fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt) has been identified as a novel biomarker for pancreatic cancer. In this study, we evaluated serum Fuc-Hpt as a biomarker for prostate cancer, and investigated the expression of fucosyltransferases and haptoglobin in prostate cancer cell lines.We measured the preoperative serum Fuc-Hpt levels in 98 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) using an established lectin-antibody ELISA. Fucosyltransferase and haptoglobin mRNA and protein expressions in prostate cancer cell lines were determined using quantitative PCR and Western blotting.Serum Fuc-Hpt levels were significantly associated with Gleason score (GS), but not prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC) for the prediction of GS ?7 in prostatectomy specimens by Fuc-Hpt was 0.753, in contrast to the PSA AUC of 0.561 and the PSAD AUC of 0.558. The Fuc-Hpt AUC for the prediction of GS upgrade from GS 6 at biopsy to GS ?7 after RP was 0.689, in contrast to the PSA AUC of 0.588 and PSAD AUC of 0.557. Multivariable analysis revealed that Fuc-Hpt levels were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy. A high expression of alpha-(1-6) fucosyltransferase (FUT8) and haptoglobin was observed in prostate cancer cell line, suggesting that certain kinds of prostate cancer cells produce Fuc-Hpt.Elevated serum Fuc-Hpt level could be a novel cancer biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer, particularly those with high GSs.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802742","annotations":[{"name":"Oligosaccharide","weight":0.937787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.791396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.760895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.7135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fucose","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucose"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.110315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0838977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Haptoglobin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptoglobin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Retinitis pigmentosa","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
