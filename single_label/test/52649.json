{"id":52649,"title":"Role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of advanced ovarian yolk sac tumor.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to identify the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the treatment of the patients with advanced stage ovarian yolk sac tumor (OYST).The comparative study was based on 53 cases with advanced stage OYST registered at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1995 to 2010. Twenty one cases were treated with NACT followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). Thirty two cases were treated with primary debulking surgery (PDS). Data on patient characteristics, treatment and survival were analyzed and compared between two groups to assess the outcome of NACT.After NACT, the overall status of the patients was improved significantly. Patients in NACT had better optimal cytoreduction rate and less peri-operative morbidities. Seven patients (13.2%) suffered from relapse. There was a significantly better PFS for patients with ovarian tumor size >20cm in the NACT than those underwent PDS. Residual disease >2cm was the independent risk factor of relapse.NACT is the better treatment option for some patients with advanced stage OYST, especially for those with unresectable tumors and poor general condition.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582864","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.822666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Peking Union Medical College","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Union_Medical_College"},{"name":"Yolk sac","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolk_sac"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Endodermal sinus tumor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodermal_sinus_tumor"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Egg yolk","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_yolk"}]}
