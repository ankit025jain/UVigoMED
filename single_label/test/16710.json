{"id":16710,"title":"Selected infectious disease disasters for nursing staff training at Egyptian Eastern Border.","abstract":"Infectious disease disasters are events that involve a biological agent, disease and that result in mass casualties, such as a bioterrorism attack, an emerging outbreak of infectious disease; all disasters pose a risk of infection transmission. But, infectious disease disasters pose the great-risk to illness or death from an infectious disease. This study raised the awareness and improved knowledge by educational program for Military Nursing Staff on selected infectious disease disasters acquired at Egyptian Eastern Border. The selected arthropod-borne diseases were Anthrax, Tick borne relapsing, Louse borne replasing fever and liver fluke; Clonorchis sinensis. An interventional study was used, for 125 staff nurse who accepted to participate. The tools dealt with four questionnaires: (1) Some sociodemographic characteristics data (2) Educational needs assessment a structured questionnaire. (3) Knowledge test (pre/post-test) and (4) Participants' reactions questionnaire. The results showed that educational intervention significantly improvements the nursing staff knowledge, which were achieved at the immediate post intervention phase, and retained via three months post-test phase. In the service training programs about infectious disease disasters at Egyptian Eastern Border must be established and continued on regular basis. This would improve their knowledge about the epidemiology of these infectious disease disasters.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961011","annotations":[{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.846119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Bioterrorism","weight":0.714545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.587247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.431579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Liver fluke","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_fluke"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Clonorchis sinensis","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonorchis_sinensis"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.179812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Louse","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse"},{"name":"Anthrax","weight":0.109501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0293009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Trematoda","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"}]}
