{"id":53476,"title":"A dual-targeting, p53-independent, apoptosis-inducing platinum(II) anticancer complex, [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl.","abstract":"The therapeutic index and cellular mechanism of action of [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl, a monocationic, square-planar platinum(II) complex, are reported. [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl was used to treat several cell lines, including wild type and cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells (A2780 and A2780CP70) and non-proliferating lung carcinoma cells (A549). [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl selectively kills cancer cells over healthy cells and exhibits no cross-resistance with cisplatin. The mechanism of cell killing was established through detailed cell-based assays. [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl exhibits dual-threat capabilities, targeting nuclear DNA and mitochondria simultaneously. [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl induces DNA damage, leading to p53 enrichment, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarisation, and caspase-mediated apoptosis. [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl also accumulates in the mitochondria, resulting in direct mitochondrial damage. Flow cytometric studies demonstrated that [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl has no significant effect on cell cycle progression. Remarkably, p53-status is a not a determinant of [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl activity. In p53-null cells, [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl induces cell death through mitochondrial dysfunction. Cancers with p53-null status could therefore be targeted using [Pt(BDI(QQ))]Cl.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24514456","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.757147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.669068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Nuclear DNA","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_DNA"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.636922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.413124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.396948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Depolarization","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Null allele","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_allele"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
