{"id":42541,"title":"[Role of cyclooxygenase 2 and its inhibitor valdecoxib in liver fibrosis].","abstract":"To explore the effects of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its inhibitor valdecoxib in liver fibrosis.Hepatic fibrosis was induced by carbon tetrachloride for 8 weeks in wild-type and COX-2 knockout mice. And the levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen IV(IV-C), procollagen III(PCIII) and ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA ) were determined. Cyclin D and cyclin E were measured in hepatic satellite cell (HSC) after a treatment of valdecoxib for 24 h or not.HA, IV-C, PCIII and ?-SMA all had significant difference in 3 groups (control group:(180 ± 13) µg/L, (56 ± 9) µg/L, (39 ± 13) µg/L, 2.49% ± 0.24% in control, F = 78.52, 61.30, 41.96, 28.15, all P < 0.05) . HA, IV-C and ?-SMA in wild-type liver fibrosis mice were higher than those in knockout counterparts ((413 ± 60) vs (308 ± 42) µg/L, (96 ± 13) vs (74 ± 10 ) µg/L, 8.99% ± 0.81% vs 4.72% ± 0.50%, all P < 0.01). But PCIII were similar between two groups ((82 ± 12) vs (72 ± 15) µg/L, P = 0.06). Wild-type mice expressed higher levels of cyclin D and cyclin E than those of knockout mice (0.96 ± 0.15 vs 0.76 ± 0.10, 0.94 ± 0.13 vs 0.82 ± 0.09, P = 0.02, 0.04). The rates of cyclin D and cyclin E were 0.40 ± 0.06 and 0.38 ± 0.05, 0.35 ± 0.04 and 0.37 ± 0.06 respectively after a treatment of valdecoxib. And both deceased in hepatic satellite cell of wild-type and knockout mice (both P < 0.01) versus those without valdecoxib.COX-2 increases the activation and proliferation of HSC leading to liver fibrosis. And its inhibitor may depress liver fibrosis by decreasing the expressions of cyclin D and cyclin E in COX-2 dependent and(or) independent way.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844967","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.900939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.838246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.837718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.814926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.620188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.543349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.47816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Carbon tetrachloride","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.223343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.201002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Valdecoxib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdecoxib"},{"name":"Myosatellite cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosatellite_cell"},{"name":"Cyclin E","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_E"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"}]}
