{"id":78702,"title":"Aural rehabilitation in children with cochlear implants: a study of cognition, social communication, and motor skill development.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the benefits of aural rehabilitation on the development of cognition, social communication, and motor skills in children with cochlear implants.The study examined the development of cognition, social communication, and motor skills in 15 deaf children (7 males, 8 females; mean age 45 months 27 days) using the Newsha Developmental Scale before they received the cochlear implants, and then again 2, 4, 6, and 8 months after the implantation. The developmental age, Pretest Developmental Rate, Intervention Efficiency Index, and Proportional Change Index were calculated for each skill.There were significant differences between the preintervention and four follow-up Developmental Rate assessments for cognition, social communication, and motor skills (P < 0.0001). Significant differences were also observed between the four follow-up Proportional Change Index assessments for cognition, social communication, and motor skills (P ? 0.005).Cochlear implantation and aural rehabilitation may result in accelerated rates of cognition, social communication, and motor skill development in deaf children.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597636","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.81795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Motor skill","weight":0.729003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.594788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Cognitive science","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.531045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.374442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Cognitive development","weight":0.248569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_development"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Social communication","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_communication"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cochlear nuclei","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nuclei"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"}]}
