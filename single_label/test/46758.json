{"id":46758,"title":"Psycho-oncology: a brief history and case study.","abstract":"Ms. W. is a 55-year-old retired Caucasian woman who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in October 2011. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent esophagectomy. She sought psychiatric help after receiving her cancer diagnosis. The field of psycho-oncology was developed to assist cancer patients and caregivers through their \"cancer journey\" from the time of diagnosis, throughout treatment and beyond. Criteria-defined psychiatric disorder, with adjustment disorder being the most common, is reported in approximately 33% to 50% of cancer patients. These realities have given psychiatry a role in the multi-disciplinary care approach in major cancer centers around the country. In this article, we describe the challenges faced by Ms. W. during her cancer diagnosis and provide a review of the literature in the emerging field of psycho-oncology and its role in the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620412","annotations":[{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.823181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.751453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.611415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.486686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.424758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.2769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.162356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Adjustment disorder","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustment_disorder"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.0127255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"}]}
