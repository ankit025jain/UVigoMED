{"id":88513,"title":"Thorn-induced pseudotumour of the fibula.","abstract":"Foreign body granulomas are common in the hand and foot. Diagnosis of the same is often delayed or missed, especially in unusual locations and in the paediatric age group. Radiographs usually reveal an osteolytic lesion with absence of periosteal reaction and non-metallic foreign bodies are not visualised in plain radiographs. An ultrasound and MRI can delineate the foreign body. Clinical and radiological presentation mimics that of a tumour and hence is rightly called pseudotumour. We present a case of thorn-induced pseudotumour of the fibula in a 5-year-old boy.
