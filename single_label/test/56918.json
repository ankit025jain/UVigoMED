{"id":56918,"title":"[The activity of enzymes of energy supply of cells in prognosis of effectiveness of auxiliary reproductive technologies].","abstract":"The comparative analysis was applied to activity of such enzymes of energy supply of cells as succinate dehydrogenase and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in women with fertility disorders and effectiveness of results of application of auxiliary reproductive technologies. The examination was passed by two groups of female patients. The main group included women with barrenness (50 patients) referred to carrying out auxiliary reproductive technologies. The auxiliary reproductive technologies resulted in pregnancy in 21 female patients (group 1a) and no pregnancy occurred in 29 female patients (group 1b). The control group consisted of non pregnant women of comparative age and having children (20 female patients). The cytochemical detection of activity of enzymes was implemented according the R.P. Nartsissov technique. The count of granules of diformazan was made by microscopical technique. Then, the mean cytochemical coefficient was calculated. The study established a reliable decrease of activity of succinate dehydrogenase and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in lymphocytes of peripheral blood in women with barrenness as compared with normal conditions. In female patients from group 1b activity of alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase was reliably lower than in group 1a (with effective attempt of auxiliary reproductive technologies).","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346982","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.732712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.711989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.315796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0603544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Standard conditions for temperature and pressure","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure"},{"name":"Succinate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Energy supply","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_supply"},{"name":"Count Dracula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
