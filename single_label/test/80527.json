{"id":80527,"title":"First finding of Echinococcus multilocularis DNA in soil: preliminary survey in Varmia-Masuria Province, northeast Poland.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to estimate the presence of Echinococcus multilocularis DNA in the soil in rural areas of Varmia-Masuria Province, Poland, which is the region with the highest recorded number of human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) cases in this country. In total, 62 soil samples were analyzed. Samples were collected in forests near the lairs of foxes, as well as from arable fields, kitchen gardens and farmyards. The parasite DNA was detected in 11.3% of the samples. This study is the first environmental survey of the presence of E. multilocularis DNA in soil. The results demonstrate that the soil can be a direct source of human infections. These results should motivate the appropriate institutions to introduce informative and educational campaigns about the risk of infection, as well as developing methods for protecting the population, especially those living in at-risk areas.
