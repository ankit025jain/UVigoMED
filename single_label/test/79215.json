{"id":79215,"title":"Reconstruction of a nasal tip defect using a V-Y island dorsal nasal flap with unilateral vascular supply. A case report.","abstract":"Closure of a nasal tip defect has specific characteristics with regards to the shape, colour, thickness and texture of skin. During the reconstruction it is necessary to observe aesthetic and functional characteristics to achieve an optimal result. There are several methods for closure of a defect in this area. One of the possible techniques is usage of a local flap. In the selection of an optimal procedure it is suitable to consider the aesthetic subunits in the nose. Usage of the V-Y flap is beneficial compared to a rotation flap or a transposition flap, which are associated with significant scaring and deformities, such as a dog-ear. Such conditions may require further corrections later. Erçöçen et al. described a V-Y island dorsal nasal flap, which they used to close a nasal tip defect. The blood supply of the flap was based on the terminal branches of angular artery on both sides (1). In our case report we used the aforementioned flap to close a nasal defect. The flap was based on the terminal branches of the angular artery only on one side.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467684","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.467016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.409814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.340496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"IBM Lotus Connections","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Lotus_Connections"},{"name":"Angular artery","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_artery"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Corrections","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections"},{"name":"Mouthfeel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthfeel"},{"name":"Holden VY Commodore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_VY_Commodore"},{"name":"Transposon","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon"}]}
