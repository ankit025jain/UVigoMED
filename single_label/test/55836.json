{"id":55836,"title":"Development of RNA interference-based therapeutics and application of multi-target small interfering RNAs.","abstract":"RNA interference (RNAi) has been proven in recent years to be a newly advanced and powerful tool for development of therapeutic agents toward various unmet medical needs such as cancer, in particular, a great attention has been paid to the development of antineoplastic agents. Recent success in clinical trials related to RNAi-based therapeutics on cancer and ocular disease has validated that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) constitute a new promising class of therapeutics. Currently, a great wealth of multi-target based siRNA structural modifications is available for promoting siRNA-mediated gene silencing with low side effects. Here, the latest developments in RNAi-based therapeutics and novel structural modifications described for siRNAs--in particular multi-target siRNAs--are reviewed.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796432","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.640466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.602805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.483969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.249585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Wealth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"}]}
