{"id":23247,"title":"Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumonia in pneumonia-prone age groups in Semarang, Java Island, Indonesia.","abstract":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a worldwide occurring pathogen Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae precedes pneumonia and other pneumococcal diseases in the community. Little is known about S. pneumoniae carriage in Indonesia, complicating strategies to control pneumococcal diseases. We investigated nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae in Semarang, Indonesia.A population-based survey was performed in Semarang, Indonesia. Nasopharyngeal swabs and questionnaires were taken from 496 healthy young (6-60 month-old) children and 45-70 year-old adults.Forty-three percent of children aged 6-60 months and 11% of adults aged 45-75 years carried S. pneumoniae. Determinants of carriage were being a child (OR 7.7; 95% CI = 4.5-13.0), passive smoking (OR 2.1; 95% CI = 1.3-3.4), and contact with toddler(s) at home (OR 3.0; 95% CI = 1.9-4.7). The most frequent serotypes found were 6A/B and 15B/C. The current commercially available vaccines cover <50% serotypes found in children. Twenty-four percent of S. pneumoniae strains were penicillin non-susceptible, and 45% were resistant to cotrimoxazol.The limited coverage of commercially available vaccines against the serotypes found in this population, and the high proportion of non-susceptibility to penicillin and cotrimoxazol suggest the need for region-specific information and strategies to control S. pneumoniae.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498104","annotations":[{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Indonesia","weight":0.786664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.77322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Passive smoking","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Java","weight":0.590777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.506676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.411485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Semarang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semarang"},{"name":"Oregon Route 7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_7"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Sailor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Alberta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"GWR 4575 Class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_4575_Class"}]}
