{"id":88757,"title":"[Research and application of multipoint centralization method in removal of small foreign body].","abstract":"To introduce a new method to remove the small foreign body in the hand or foot, and to discuss its feasibility and effectiveness.Between May 2007 and March 2012, 78 patients with small foreign bodies embedded in the soft tissue of the hand or foot were treated with the method. There were 51 males and 27 females, aged from 7 to 69 years with an average of 32.5 years. The hand, wrist, and foot were involved in 48, 6, and 24 cases respectively. Foreign body type included fiberglass (57 cases), thorn (11 cases), iron (5 cases), bamboo thorn (2 cases), fishbone (2 cases), and metal needles (1 case). The time between injury and operation was 30 minutes to 16 days (mean, 2.6 days). The position and range of the foreign body were defined using the multipoint centralization method before removal surgery. The skin was cut according multipoint connection for finding small foreign body under a microscope.All foreign bodies were successfully removed. The mean operation time was 6 minutes (range, 3-22 minutes). Healing of incision by first intention was obtained in all cases; no blood circulation disorders or infection occurred. All the patients were followed up 3 months-3 years (mean, 9 months). The distal limb had no feeling or movement disorders.Removal of small foreign body in soft-tissue using multipoint centralization method is safe and effective.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796202","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.671589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.660502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.651766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.552062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.459697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.409038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Bamboo","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Fishbone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbone"},{"name":"Videoconferencing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoconferencing"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Centralisation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralisation"},{"name":"Movement disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_disorder"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Thorns, spines, and prickles","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles"}]}
