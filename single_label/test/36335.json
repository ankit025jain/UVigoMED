{"id":36335,"title":"Myocardial bridging: contemporary understanding of pathophysiology with implications for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","abstract":"Patients with myocardial bridging are often asymptomatic, but this anomaly may be associated with exertional angina, acute coronary syndromes, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, or even sudden cardiac death. This review presents our understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial bridging and describes prevailing diagnostic modalities and therapeutic options for this challenging clinical entity.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583304","annotations":[{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.876424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.632853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Exercise intolerance","weight":0.1416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_intolerance"},{"name":"Acute coronary syndrome","weight":0.0672669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_coronary_syndrome"}]}
