{"id":20773,"title":"Ventral herniation due to tuberculosis at space of Retzius: a rare presentation.","abstract":"Tuberculosis may involve any organ in the body and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis is commonly seen in immuno-compromised patients mostly in developing countries. Here we report an unusual case of tuberculosis of space of retzius (pre-peritoneal space) forming a lump, this lump caused weakness of anterior abdominal wall which later developed ventral hernia, corrected by surgery in a 62-year immuno-competent person. This type of presentation of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis at space of Retzius has been rarely reported.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640349","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.808858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.716637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.550086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.506296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.264614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.212232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.118155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Retropubic space","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retropubic_space"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Welland Canal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welland_Canal"},{"name":"Zang-fu","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zang-fu"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"}]}
