{"id":81276,"title":"Intrabony defects and non-surgical treatment.","abstract":"Periodontitis can lead to vertical bone loss with the creation of 'intrabony defects', associated with higher risk of progression if left untreated. Intrabony defects are considered candidates for periodontal surgical procedures, in order to arrest disease progression and achieve bone regeneration. This paper brings forward anecdotal and scientific evidence from the literature to describe how even non-surgical periodontal treatment can result in clinical and radiographic resolution of periodontal intrabony defects.
