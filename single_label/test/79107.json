{"id":79107,"title":"Comparison of effects on voice of diode laser and cold knife microlaryngology techniques for vocal fold polyps.","abstract":"To compare the effects on voice of endolaryngeal microsurgery (EMS) with cold instruments and a new method, \"diode laser,\" for vocal fold polyps.Fifty-one patients with vocal fold polyps suffering from dysphonia who were treated in the Erciyes University Department of Otolaryngology were included in the study. Voice analysis was performed in a soundproof room, holding the microphone 15 cm away from the patients' mouth and by recording a sustained [a] vowel for at least 10 seconds. Fundamental frequency (F0), Jitter, Shimmer, and noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR) parameters were evaluated in terms of vocal analysis. All patients were asked for to fill in a questionnaire, after being informed about the voice handicap index (VHI). EMS was performed with a diode laser and cold knife on 26 and 25 patients, respectively. Patient follow-up was performed 8 weeks after surgery. Changes in F0, Jitter, Shimmer, and NHR values were measured and recorded. VHI was also completed and reassessed.There was a significant difference in each technique's VHI score between the preoperative and postoperative questionnaire (P < 0.001). Postoperatively, there was no significant difference in VHI scores between two groups (P > 0.05). There was a significant difference in voice analysis values measured preoperatively and at the postoperative controls for both groups (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, there was no significant difference in voice analysis values between two groups (P > 0.05).In the treatment of vocal polyps, EMS with both diode laser and traditional cold knife is effective.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491500","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.705575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Fundamental frequency","weight":0.628222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.513689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Microphone","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.220191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vowel","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel"},{"name":"Laser diode","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diode","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode"},{"name":"Jitter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Vhi Healthcare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vhi_Healthcare"},{"name":"Erciyes University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erciyes_University"},{"name":"Voice analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_analysis"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Knife","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Soundproofing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundproofing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mount Erciyes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Erciyes"},{"name":"Thiourea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiourea"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"15 cm SK L/45","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_cm_SK_L/45"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Handicap (golf)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_(golf)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Fundamental (Pet Shop Boys album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_(Pet_Shop_Boys_album)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
