{"id":68973,"title":"Prognostic value of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate in radical prostatectomy specimens.","abstract":"Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is an adverse prognostic factor for radical prostatectomy (RP). The endpoint in most IDC-P studies is increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether IDC-P in RP specimens is an adverse prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).We retrospectively evaluated 206 high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with RP and analyzed data on age, serum PSA level at diagnosis, biopsy Gleason score (bGS), surgical margin (SM), clinical T stage (cT), extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), lymph node metastasis (LN), and neoadjuvant therapy.An IDC-P component was found in 104 cases. Forty-four patients experienced clinical failure, and 20 patients died of the disease. Patients with IDC-P showed a higher bGS and stage (including cT, EPE, SVI, and LN) than those without IDC-P. In univariate analysis, IDC-P, PSA level, bGS, SM, cT, SVI, LN, and EPE (P?<?0.0001) were significantly associated with PFS. IDC-P (P?=?0.0004), PSA level (P?<?0.0001), SM (P?=?0.0013), cT (P?=?0.0019), SVI (P?=?0.0012), and LN (P?=?0.0002) were significantly associated with CSS. In multivariate analysis, IDC-P (P?=?0.0038), and cT (P?=?0.0001) were significantly associated with PFS. IDC-P (P?=?0.0238) and PSA level (P?=?0.0112) were significantly associated with CSS.IDC-P in RP specimens was an independent risk factor for PFS and CSS and could predict clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481730","annotations":[{"name":"Seminal vesicle","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminal_vesicle"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.872009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.762811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.722734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Surgical margin","weight":0.718787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_margin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.649198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lactiferous duct","weight":0.485304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactiferous_duct"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.426053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
