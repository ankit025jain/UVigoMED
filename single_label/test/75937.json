{"id":75937,"title":"[Emotional disorders in patients with cerebellar damage--case studies].","abstract":"Growing number of research shows the role of the cerebellum in the regulation of affect. Lesions of the cerebellum can lead to emotional disregulation, a significant part of the Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome. The aim of this article is to analyze the most recent studies concerning the cerebellar participation in emotional reactions and to present three cases: two female and one male who suffered from cerebellar damage and presented post-traumatic affective and personality change.The patients' neuropsychological examination was performed with Raven's Progressive Matrices Test--standard version, Trial Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Auditory Verbal Learning Test by Luria, Benton Visual Retention Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Stroop Interference Test, Attention and Perceptivity Test (Test Uwagi i Spostrzegawczo?ci TUS), Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI).The review of the literature suggest cerebellar participation, especially teh vermis and paravermial regions, in the detection, integration and filtration of emotional information and in regulation of autonomic emotional responses. In the described patients we observed: oversensitivity, irritability, impulsivity and self-neglect. The man and the woman with right-sided lesions presented similar symptoms: rigidity ofthought, stubbornness, lack of criticism,jocular and inappropriate behavior. The woman with left-sided cerebellar lesion was adynamic, apathic and passive, she presented emotional blunting, social isolation, lack of interests and motivation, general cognitive slowdown.Both the analyzed research and the described cases indicate the connection between the cerebellum and emotion regulation. The symptoms presented by the described patients were most probably a consequence of damaged cerebellar projections to subcortical structures (the limbic system) and frontal areas. The diversification of symptoms depending on the localization of lesions had not been described yet and seems to indicate an interesting direction for future research.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016766","annotations":[{"name":"Limbic
