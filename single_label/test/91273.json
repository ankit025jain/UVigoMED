{"id":91273,"title":"Imaging of radial wrist pain. Part II: pathology.","abstract":"Pain on the radial side of the wrist is a common clinical presentation. Such wrist pain may provide a diagnostic challenge for radiologists, in view of the small size of the anatomic structures, the occasional subtlety of the imaging findings, the diversity of potential etiologies, as well as the non-infrequent occurrence of incidental asymptomatic findings in this area. This review discusses the imaging findings in both the more common and less common causes of radial-sided wrist pain, concentrating particularly on the detection of early disease and less readily apparent abnormalities.
