{"id":91533,"title":"[Advances in the research of fluid resuscitation and its monitoring in burn patients].","abstract":"Shock is the one of the most serious complications during the early stage of burn injury. Early effective fluid resuscitation, enabling the burn patient to pass through the shock stage smoothly and uneventfully, plays a necessary and essential role in the prevention of the subsequent organ complications, reduction of mortality and morbidity, and improvement in life quality. Rapid restoration of blood volume is the fundamental measure to prevent burn shock. In this review, the history and the current status of several important issues related to burn shock resuscitation, including the fluid replacement formula, quality of fluids, and monitoring of physiological parameters, were over viewed. The authors also proposed that a new therapeutic strategy to prevent microvascular permeability should be emphasized and developed in future, which may hopefully act as the most basic approach to prevent burn shock and its related complications.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495644","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.645335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.644086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.620471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.56664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.54117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.269901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.0200714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"}]}
