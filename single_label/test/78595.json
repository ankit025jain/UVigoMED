{"id":78595,"title":"[The clinical study of eight cases of nasal solitary keratoacanthoma].","abstract":"The clinical and pathological data of eight cases of nasal solitary keratoacanthoma were analyzed and relevant literatures were reviewed. All of the cases were verified via pathological examination after local lesion excision, along with reconstruction of tissue defects in external nose. The patients were all primary healed. With a follow up from 8 months up to 7 years, only one case relapsed one year after first surgery, and given another operation, no recurrence happened thereafter. The other seven cases did not recur so far. The nasal solitary keratoacanthoma is a squamous tumor with potential malignancy, which manifests similarly with squamous cell carcinoma, and the correct diagnosis requires comprehensive judgment from both the clinical and histopathological characteristics. The disease shows favorable prognosis and low recurrence rate.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620674","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.762615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Keratoacanthoma","weight":0.127778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoacanthoma"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
