{"id":20690,"title":"[Establishment and application of multiplex PCR for non-O157 H7 STEC virulence genes detection].","abstract":"Traditional detection approaches for non-O157 STEC are both time and labour consuming in diseases surveillance. Virulence genes detection based on multiplex PCR could not only improve the detection efficiency but also increase the accuracy.Six virulence genes of non-O157:H7 (stx1, stx2, eae, hly, etpD, katP6) were detected by two groups of trebling PCRs. The multiplex PCRs were optimized by melting curve analysis in SYBR Green I real-time PCR. Testing result of multiplex PCR was consistent with serological testing.The sensitivity limits of the multiplex PCR for stx1, stx2, eaeP, etpD, katP, and hly were 10 ng/ml, 120 ng/ml, 110 ng/ml,165 ng/ml, 85 ng/ml, and 15 ng/ml, respectively, which is similar with that of single PCR. When the multiplex PCR was applied in 120 adults and 90 children diarrhea samples detection, 13 cases were detected for non-O157 positive.The method we established can be used for non-O157 STEC virulence genes detection and screening with high efficiency and accuracy.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645332","annotations":[{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.252079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.238129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Melting curve analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_curve_analysis"},{"name":"Multiplex polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"SYBR Green I","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYBR_Green_I"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"British NVC community H7","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_NVC_community_H7"},{"name":"STEC, Inc.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEC,_Inc."},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Gymnasium (Denmark)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Denmark)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Melting point","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"The Establishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment"}]}
