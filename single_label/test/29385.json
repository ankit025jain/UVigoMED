{"id":29385,"title":"Violence, victimization, criminal justice involvement, and substance use among drug-involved men.","abstract":"This research identified three subgroups of drug-involved men based on severity of self-reported violence perpetration against intimate or nonintimate partners among a sample of 148 men selected from a subsample of participants in the Kentucky National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) AIDS Cooperative Agreement. Men in the No Violence group accounted for approximately 19% of the total respondents, men in the Moderate Violence Severity and Extreme Violence Severity groups comprises 56% and 25% of the sample, respectively. Men in the Extreme Violence Severity group experienced significantly more psychological victimization as children and more frequent physical childhood abuse than did their peers. Men in the Extreme Violence Severity group reported having earlier involvement in the criminal justice system and lawbreaking behavior; they also reported higher frequency of marijuana and crack use. Implications for treatment and future research are presented.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672994","annotations":[{"name":"National Institute on Drug Abuse","weight":0.816629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Drug_Abuse"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.722519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Criminal justice","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Justice","weight":0.641392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.428434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.426857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Victimisation","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimisation"},{"name":"Kentucky","weight":0.29111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Crack cocaine","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine"},{"name":"List of country legal systems","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_legal_systems"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0529744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
