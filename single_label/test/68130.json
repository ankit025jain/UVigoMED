{"id":68130,"title":"Serum total hCG? level is an independent prognostic factor in transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract.","abstract":"Serum total human chorionic gonadotrophin ? subunit (hCG?) level might have prognostic value in urothelial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) but has not been investigated for independence from other prognostic variables.We utilised a clinical database of patients receiving chemotherapy between 2005 and 2011 for urothelial TCC and an independent cohort of radical cystectomy patients for validation purposes. Prognostic variables were tested by univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests. Statistically significant variables were then assessed by multivariate Cox regression. Total hCG? level was dichotomised at < vs ?2?IU?l(-1).A total of 235 chemotherapy patients were eligible. For neoadjuvant chemotherapy, established prognostic factors including low ECOG performance status, normal haemoglobin, lower T stage and suitability for cisplatin-based chemotherapy were associated with favourable survival in univariate analyses. In addition, low hCG? level was favourable when assessed either before (median survival not reached vs 1.86 years, P=0.001) or on completion of chemotherapy (4.27 vs 0.42 years, P=0.000002). This was confirmed in multivariate analyses and in patients receiving first- and second-line palliative chemotherapy, and in a radical cystectomy validation set.Serum total hCG? level is an independent prognostic factor in patients receiving chemotherapy for urothelial TCC in both curative and palliative settings.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556622","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.773486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.673752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.362475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.346584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.319609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.267874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.251152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.218828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"235","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/235"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cooperative_Oncology_Group"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
