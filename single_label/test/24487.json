{"id":24487,"title":"Virologic and histologic characterisation of dual hepatitis B and C co-infection in Egyptian patients.","abstract":"Data about dual hepatitis C (HCV) and B (HBV) co-infection are still scarce, especially in endemic areas such as Egypt. Therefore, we aimed to characterise the virologic and histologic pattern of dual B/C co-infection in a tertiary care centre in Egypt.After obtaining approval from the review board, a retrospective design to evaluate the data registry between January 2009 and December 2012 of patients with dual HCV and HBV seropositivity (BC-group) at the Viral Hepatitis Unit in Ministry of Health and Assiut University Hospital, Egypt was conducted. Data for hepatitis B e antigen (HBe-Ag) and anti-HB core status, anti-hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV), HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA assays and liver biopsy (METAVIR scoring) results were collected. Two other matched groups of mono-HCV (C-group) and HBV (B-group) were selected as controls. All patients were naive for antiviral therapy.A total of 3300 patients were enrolled. Dual infection was observed in 25 (0.7%) patients (all males, mean=35.2Â±10.2years). Four patients (16%) were HBe-Ag-positive. Six (24%) patients were HBV-DNA-negative and all were positive for HCV RNA. Between groups, raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was found in 76%, 41.7% and 49.2% of the BC, B and C groups, respectively (p=0.023). HBV DNA >2000IUml(-1) was more in the B-group than in the BC-group (63.9% vs. 36%; p=0.042) and HCV RNA >800,000IUml(-1) was more in the BC-group than in the C-group (28% vs. 12.3%; p=0.009). Histologically, there is no statistical significant difference between the three groups.Dual hepatitis B/C infection is not uncommon and their virologic and histologic profile is modest. Further evaluation with regard to treatment and long-term follow-up is warranted.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433642","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.840983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.660967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.599617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.474975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.454125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.446471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.413101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.274307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.259835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.189677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ghent University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent_University"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"River delta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta"}]}
