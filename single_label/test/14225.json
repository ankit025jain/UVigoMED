{"id":14225,"title":"CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells activated during feline immunodeficiency virus infection convert T helper cells into functional suppressors through a membrane-bound TGF? / GARP-mediated mechanism.","abstract":"We and others have previously reported that cell membrane-bound TGF? (mTGF?) on activated T regulatory (Treg) cells mediates suppressor function. Current findings suggest that a novel protein known as Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant (GARP) anchors mTGF? to the Treg cell surface and facilitates suppressor activity. Recently, we have described that GARP+TGF?+ Treg cells expand during the course of FIV infection. Because Treg cells are anergic and generally exhibit poor proliferative ability, we asked how Treg homeostasis is maintained during the course of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection.Here, we report that Treg cells from FIV+ cats express GARP and mTGF? and convert T helper (Th) cells into phenotypic and functional Treg cells. Th to Treg conversion was abrogated by anti-TGF? or anti-GARP treatment of Treg cells or by anti-TGF?RII treatment of Th cells, suggesting that Treg cell recruitment from the Th pool is mediated by TGF?/TGF?RII signaling and that cell-surface GARP plays a major role in this process.These findings suggest Th to Treg conversion may initiate a cascade of events that contributes to the maintenance of virus reservoirs, progressive Th cell immunosuppression, and the development of immunodeficiency, all of which are central to the pathogenesis of AIDS lentivirus infections.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438223","annotations":[{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.907832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.790693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Feline immunodeficiency virus","weight":0.447041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus"},{"name":"Clonal anergy","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_anergy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.422166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.326757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.245994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.238896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Felidae","weight":0.0365959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Suppressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
