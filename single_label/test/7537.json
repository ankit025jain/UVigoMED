{"id":7537,"title":"Effect of curcumin on lifespan, activity pattern, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the brains of transgenic Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"A time dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of intracellular aggregates of alpha synuclein have been reported in PD model flies.The progeny (PD flies) expressing human alpha synuclein was exposed to 25, 50, and 100?µM of curcumin mixed in the diet for 24 days. The effect of curcumin was studied on lifespan, activity pattern, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the brains of PD model flies. The activity of PD model flies was monitored by using Drosophila activity monitors (DAMs). For the estimation of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content were estimated in the flies brains of each treated groups. The cell death in Drosophila brain was analyzed by isolating brains in Ringer's solution placing them in 70% ethanol and stained in acridine orange to calculate the gray scale values.The exposure of flies to 25, 50, and 100?µM of curcumin showed a dose dependent significant delay in the loss of activity pattern, reduction in the oxidative stress and apoptosis, and increase in the life span of PD model flies.Curcumin is potent in reducing PD symptoms.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24860828","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.855183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.724962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Curcumin","weight":0.717521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.657002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Carbonyl","weight":0.603424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.523718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.335579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.276029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.249126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.242562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.149656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Orange (fruit)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)"},{"name":"Alpha decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay"},{"name":"Eye color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color"},{"name":"Synuclein","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synuclein"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Social rejection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
