{"id":90207,"title":"[Effectiveness of computer-assisted preoperative planning system in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction].","abstract":"To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of computer-assisted preoperative planning system-ACL Detector in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.Between March 2009 and January 2012, 80 patients with ACL rupture received arthroscopic ACL single-bundle reconstruction with autologous hamstring tendon transplantation. Before operation, the preoperative planning was done by computer-assisted preoperative planning system-ACL Detector (trial group, n=40) or by conventional method (control group, n=40). There was no significant difference in gender, age, disease duration, injury cause, preoperative Lysholm score, and preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score between 2 groups (P > 0.05). After operation, the effectiveness was evaluated by Lachman test, pivot shift test, Lysholm score, and IKDC score; the digital three-dimensinal model of knee was reconstructed, and the impingement rate of ACL graft was measured.All incisions healed by first intention, and no complication was found. The patients were followed up 18-25 months (mean, 20 months) in trial group and 18-24 months (mean, 21 months) in control group. The Lysholm score and IKDC score were significantly increased at 18 months after operation when compared with preoperative scores (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The results of Lachman test and pivot shift test at 18 months after operation were significantly better than those before operation in 2 groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference between 2 groups after operation (P > 0.05). MRI showed that impingement was observed in 1 case of trial group (2.50%) and in 8 cases of control group (20.00%), showing significant difference (chi2=4.51, P=0.03).The computer-assisted preoperative planning system-ACL Detector could be successfully applied to ACL reconstruction. It has the same improvement in knee functional score as conventional surgery, but it is better than conventional surgery in reducing the impingement incidence.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640359","annotations":[{"name":"Anterior cruciate
