{"id":61429,"title":"Enhanced accuracy of optical platelet counts in microcytic anemia.","abstract":"To determine whether microcytic erythrocytes influence the accuracy of automated platelet (PLT) counting.We divided a total of 206 K2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated blood samples into 4 groups, as follows: In group 1 (control group), normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV > 80 fL) and PLT count equal or greater than 140,000/microL (n = 45); group 2, normal MCV, reduced PLT count (< 140 x 10(3)/microL, n = 41); group 3, microcytic samples with normal PLT count (n = 68); and group 4, microcytic samples with reduced PLT count (n = 49). We also compared the platelet counting using electroimpedance (PLT-EI), platelet count using fluorescent optical (PLT-FO), and platelet-count manual (PLT-M) methods, using the Sysmex XE 2100 automatic analyzer.Despite highly significant overall correlations between PLT-EI and PLT-FO, PLT-EI and PLT-M, and PLT-FO and PLT-M (r = 0.95 [all P < .001]), use of the PLT-EI method resulted in widely overestimated PLT counts in microcytic samples (MCV < 80 fL), compared with use of PLT-FO and PLT-M. Our results identify an MCV of 70 fL as the critical threshold below which PLT-EI became unreliable.The PLT-EI mode overestimated PLT counts compared with PLT-FO and PLT-M modes in microcytic blood. Therefore, PLT-FO is the preferred method for PLT counting in patients with microcytic anemia when using an automated analyzer.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719982","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.668553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.605647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","weight":0.590867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.547915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Microcytic anemia","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcytic_anemia"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Automated analyser","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_analyser"},{"name":"Mean corpuscular volume","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_corpuscular_volume"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"K2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Normal mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode"},{"name":"Threshold potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_potential"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Racket (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Sysmex Corporation","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysmex_Corporation"},{"name":"Femtolitre","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtolitre"}]}
