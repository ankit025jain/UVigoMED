{"id":55337,"title":"A comparison of N-glycan profiles in human plasma and vitreous fluid.","abstract":"To investigate the concentration and composition of N-glycans in plasma and vitreous samples obtained from patients with non-proliferative vitreoretinal diseases.Plasma and vitreous samples were collected from 11 patients with idiopathic macular hole (MH) and 9 patients with epiretinal membrane (ERM). The samples were pretreated for enzymatic cleaving, and subsequently glycans released from proteins were captured on BlotGlyco H beads. Sialic acids were methyl-esterified. Processed glycans were tagged with aminooxy-functionalized peptide reagent (aoWR) and released from the beads, followed by detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The concentration and composition of N-glycans in the samples were assessed.Concentration of N-glycans in vitreous samples (132?±?29 pmol/100 ?g protein) was significantly lower compared with those in plasma samples (714?±?29 pmol/100 ?g protein, p?<?0.001). Predominant N-glycan in both plasma (39.7?±?1.1 %) and vitreous fluid (37.2?±?3.1 %) was identical, and the composition was presumed as [(Hex)2(HexNAc)2(NeuAc)2+ (Man)3(GlcNAc)2]. By contrast, the second-ranked N-glycan in vitreous samples (15.6?±?1.5 %) was the seventh in plasma (2.3?±?0.2 %).The current data provide useful information on N-glycan profile in the vitreous fluid, which is distinct from that in the plasma.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912590","annotations":[{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.745682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.738666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.674419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.663432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.571009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.477417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.468164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Glycan","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycan"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.361637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.186109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"N-Acetylglucosamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Acetylglucosamine"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Medal of Honor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"}]}
