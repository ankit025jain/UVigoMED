{"id":47060,"title":"Hemorrhoids and fistulas: new solutions to old problems.","abstract":"Symptoms thought related to hemorrhoids must be carefully considered before intervention. The first line of therapy for any hemorrhoidal complaint remains conservative management with increased fluid and fiber intake and appropriate modification of toileting behavior. Bleeding in grades 1 and 2 hemorrhoids that does not respond to this can be satisfactorily and safely managed with office-based therapies; some grade 3 hemorrhoids would also respond to this, though more treatment sessions would likely be required. Operative therapy is the best choice for management of persistently symptomatic grade 2 disease and for grades 3 and 4 symptomatic hemorrhoids as well. With proper patient selection and preparation, along with a familiarity with instrumentation and techniques, good results can be obtained with newer operative interventions for internal hemorrhoids. Outcomes must always be compared with those obtained with classic excisional hemorrhoidectomy.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606821","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.531202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.175701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Hemorrhoid","weight":0.161645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0173036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Second grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_grade"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Toileting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toileting"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Complaint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"}]}
