{"id":62631,"title":"Severe neutropenia and relative dose intensity among patients<65 and ?65 years with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving CHOP-based chemotherapy.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to describe the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia, patterns of chemotherapy treatment, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) use patterns among patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)<65 and ?65 years.This retrospective, observational study included adult patients with NHL who received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone±rituximab (CHOP±R) from January 2006 to June 2010.A total of 1,579 patients were included, with 54.1%<65 years and 45.9%?65 years. Most received CHOP-R on a Q3W schedule. Among patients<65 years, the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia was 52.3%, the mean relative dose intensity (RDI) was 80.4%, and the incidences of dose delays and reductions were 26.5 and 9.6%, respectively. Among patients?65 years, the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia was 63.2%, the mean RDI was 73.9%, and the incidences of dose delays and reductions were 24.6 and 24.9%, respectively. Most patients (86.9%) received G-CSF. Among patients<65 years, 71.9, 17.4, and 10.7% first received G-CSF as primary prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, or treatment, respectively. Among patients?65 years, 80.1, 11.6, and 8.3% first received G-CSF as primary prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, or treatment, respectively.Chemotherapy regimens and schedules were similar among age groups. Grade 3/4 neutropenia, reduced RDI, and dose delays were common in both age groups, though patients?65 years had a higher incidence of dose reductions. In spite of these similarities, patients<65 years were less likely to receive primary prophylactic G-CSF. Thus, careful assessment of neutropenia risk factors is needed across age groups to determine appropriate G-CSF use and support planned chemotherapy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535242","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.73487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.56748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.351701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.314289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.216677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.0886608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"Royal Designers for Industry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Designers_for_Industry"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"965","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/965"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"3W (company)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3W_(company)"},{"name":"Q3","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q3"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
