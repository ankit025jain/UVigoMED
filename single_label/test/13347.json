{"id":13347,"title":"Mortality in captive baboons (Papio spp.): a-23-year study.","abstract":"We report the causes of mortality for 4350 captive baboons that died or were euthanized due to natural causes during a 23Â year period at the Southwest National Primate Research Center.Necropsy records were retrieved and reviewed to determine a primary cause of death or indication for euthanasia. Data was evaluated for morphological diagnosis, organ system, and etiology.The 20 most common morphologic diagnoses accounted for 76% of the cases, including stillborn (10.8%); colitis (8.6%); hemorrhage (8.4%); ulcer (5.2%); seizures (4.7%); pneumonia (4.2%); inanition (4.1%); dermatitis (3.8%); spondylosis (3.3%); and amyloidosis (3.0%). The digestive system was most frequently involved (21.3%), followed by the urogenital (20.3%), cardiovascular (12.2%), and multisystem disease (10.3%). An etiology was not identified in approximately one-third of cases. The most common etiologies were trauma (14.8%), degenerative (9.5%), viral (8.7%), and neoplastic/proliferative (7.0%).This information should be useful for individuals working with baboons.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483852","annotations":[{"name":"Virus","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.827921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Amyloidosis","weight":0.773478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis"},{"name":"Euthanasia","weight":0.746852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stillbirth","weight":0.617732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth"},{"name":"Starvation","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.571808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.419363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Death by natural causes","weight":0.32253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_natural_causes"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.312485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Baboon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baboon"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Southwestern United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"}]}
