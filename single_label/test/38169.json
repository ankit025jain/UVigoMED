{"id":38169,"title":"Facial expression recognition and emotion understanding in children after neonatal open-heart surgery for transposition of the great arteries.","abstract":"Theory of mind impairments are part of the cognitive morbidities associated with transposition of the great arteries (TGA). We sought to assess core components of social cognition in school-aged children with TGA.Thirty-eight children with neonatal corrected TGA (27 males, 11 females; mean age 7y 3mo, SD 1y 2mo) and a comparison group (n=31; 24 males, 7 females; mean age 7y 4mo, SD 1y 1mo) participated in this study. All children completed measures of facial expression recognition, emotion comprehension, and second-order cognitive and affective false-belief tasks. The association of medical pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables with cognitive outcomes was explored.After controlling for potential covariates, children with TGA performed significantly less accurately in the mental category of the emotion comprehension battery (p=0.002) and on second-order affective false-belief tasks (p<0.05). Preoperative variables including an associated ventricular septal defect (p=0.02), a younger age at open-heart surgery (p=0.03), and a prenatal diagnosis of TGA (p=0.02) were significantly associated with better outcomes.School-aged children with TGA display significant impairment on complex affective mental state understanding even though facial expression recognition was generally preserved. Preoperative factors may be important determinants for long-term outcomes after cyanotic congenital heart disease.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444170","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.915977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.766295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.707385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.704159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Transposition of the great vessels","weight":0.626303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_of_the_great_vessels"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.493394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.481543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Great arteries","weight":0.400956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_arteries"},{"name":"Theory of mind","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.344936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Social cognition","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.11935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"}]}
