{"id":65483,"title":"Arteriovenous access for hemodialysis: preoperative assessment and planning.","abstract":"Longevity in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is dependent on adequacy of renal replacement therapy. Over 85% of the global ESRD population is hemodialysis dependent. Preoperative evaluation is the cornerstone of vascular access planning. The goal of preoperative evaluation is to design a sequence of options that can be used to provide vascular access throughout the life span of an ESRD patient. The intention should be to provide a durable vascular access in a timely fashion that needs few interventions, while refraining from jeopardizing future needs.
