{"id":43431,"title":"Endoscopic therapy with 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate for the treatment of gastric varices.","abstract":"Gastric variceal bleeding is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and limited endoscopic therapeutic options.The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of endoscopic therapy with 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate in patients with gastric variceal bleeding.A single-center retrospective review of patients receiving endoscopic therapy for gastric variceal hemorrhage. Patient demographics, laboratory, and procedural data were collected. Patients were followed to death, liver transplantation, or last follow-up. Success rates were defined as immediate control of bleeding; early re-bleeding (1-7 days), short-term re-bleeding (1-12 weeks), overall survival, and serious procedure complications.A total of 41 patients (39 with cirrhosis) underwent 54 cyanoacrylate injections during study period. Mean age was 57 and 73 % were males. Twenty-four (58.5 %) patients had failed or were deemed ineligible for transjugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt, and 5 % were done for primary prophylaxis. Immediate hemostasis was achieved in five active bleeders. During a median survival time of 117 days, early re-bleeding was seen in 1 (2.4 %), short-term re-bleeding in five patients (12 %), and varices were eradicated in 15 (46.8 %) patients on follow-up. Mean MELD score at the time of the first injection was 17.1 Â± 7.8. Mean volume injected was 3.4 cc and median number of varices injected per session was one. Eight patients died during the long-term follow-up: metastatic cancer (2), infections (3), liver failure (1), and re-bleeding (2). There were no serious procedure-related complications.Endoscopic cyanoacrylate therapy appears effective and safe for treatment of patients with bleeding from gastric varices or high-risk stigmata.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788319","annotations":[{"name":"Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt","weight":0.82289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjugular_intrahepatic_portosystemic_shunt"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.793624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.780715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.740334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.727355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.661326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.649292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.491498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.361862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.321355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cyanoacrylate","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate"},{"name":"Gastric varices","weight":0.125636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_varices"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Stigmata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmata"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
