{"id":61450,"title":"Cavernous hemangioma of the frontal bone: a case report.","abstract":"Cavernous hemangiomas are rare benign bone tumors and those at the level of the cranial bones are even rarer.A 50-year-old woman of Italian ethnicity presented with a frontal mass. A computed tomography scan showed an osteolytic lesion and a magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a hypointense lesion on the T1-weighted image and a hyperintense lesion on the T2-weighted image. We performed a tailored craniectomy and cranioplasty. Histological examination revealed a cavernous hemangioma.These benign tumors do not have classic radiographic features and so can be misinterpreted as lesions like multiple myeloma or osteosarcoma. Consequently, the diagnosis is most often made during surgical resection.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717076","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.815306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.674738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Bone tumor","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_tumor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.484677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.425994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Decompressive craniectomy","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompressive_craniectomy"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.185902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.181385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Cavernous hemangioma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_hemangioma"},{"name":"Cranioplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranioplasty"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Frontal bone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_bone"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Cavernous sinus","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"}]}
