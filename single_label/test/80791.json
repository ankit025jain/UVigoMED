{"id":80791,"title":"Pathological findings of Angiostrongylus vasorum infection in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from Central Italy, with the first report of a disseminated infection in this host species.","abstract":"In Europe, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is considered the reservoir of Angiostrongylus vasorum, nematode residing in the pulmonary arteries and right heart of dogs and many species of wild carnivores. Italy is considered one of the European countries where this nematode is actually spreading. Between May 2007 and November 2013, 62 foxes found dead in Central Italy were necropsied. Right heart and pulmonary arteries were opened and checked for the presence of adult parasites. Impression smears from sectioned lungs were examined for the presence of first-stage larvae, and samples of lungs were processed for histological examination. In order to detect eventual disseminated infections, samples of heart, pulmonary lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, and brain of foxes positive for A. vasorum at necropsy or lungs histological examination were processed for histological examination. An overall prevalence of 43.5% was recorded. Light, mild, and severe lung lesions were detected in 33.3, 22.2, and 25.9% of infected animals, respectively. Severe lesions were more frequent in animals younger than 12 months. In five infected foxes (18.5%), no gross lesions were observed, while for three animals, angiostrongylosis was considered the cause of death. A case of disseminated angiostrongylosis was detected and another one was suspected. This is the firs report of disseminated angiostrongylosis in the fox.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532011","annotations":[{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.855339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.761989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.758055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Carnivore","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.608393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.558321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.549832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.520962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.40255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Fox","weight":0.3499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox"},{"name":"Red Fox","weight":0.291792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fox"},{"name":"Carnivora","weight":0.214562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.107842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Gross anatomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_anatomy"},{"name":"Right heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_heart"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}]}
