{"id":9366,"title":"[Alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease].","abstract":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, of which patomechanizm entirely is not clear. In the picture neuropathologically there is observed degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons, but also noradrenergic, serotonergic and cholinergic neurons in patients with PD. It is believed, that causes of PD are both environmental and genetic factors, associated mainly with mutations in the SNCA and PRKN genes, which may lead to changes in the structure of proteins such as alpha-synuclein (ASN) and Parkin. In neurons, disorders of the protein structure can lead to its aggregation and formation of soluble oligomers and insoluble filaments in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis. In PD aggregation of ASN can be modulated by many factors like: oxidative stress, other neuronal proteins, Parkin, catecholamines especially dopamine, and mutations of SNCA gene. It also appears that some impact on the aggregation of ASN may have destabilizing factors of ASN tetramers. That, does ASN may become a new point for pharmacotherapy in PD.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712265","annotations":[{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Lewy body","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cholinergic","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Serotonergic","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonergic"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.677436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Parkin (ligase)","weight":0.64425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkin_(ligase)"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Alpha-synuclein","weight":0.583205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-synuclein"},{"name":"Protein structure","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure"},{"name":"Oligomer","weight":0.51667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.381959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.193115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Tetrameric protein","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrameric_protein"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Protein aggregation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_aggregation"}]}
