{"id":63672,"title":"[Loeffler's syndrome mimicking bronchial asthma and pneumonia in a child: case report].","abstract":"A 14-year-old male child was hospitalized with complaints of a bronchial wheezing, cough, dyspnea, and sputum and a preliminary diagnosis of bronchial asthma and pneumonia. The patient was treated empirically for bronchial asthma and pneumonia, but gave neitherr clinical nor radiological response to treatment. On the high-resolution computerized tomography, a typical spiral image of Ascaris lumbricoides was identified inside a cavity in the upper lobe of the left lung with a diameter of 8x7 cm. Also,migratory pneumonic infiltrations progressing between the lower lobe and hilary region of the left lung were seen. Examination of the peripheral blood smear of the patient revealed eosinophilia (40%), while IgE was measured as 350 IU/mL. The patient was diagnosed as \"Loeffler's syndrome\" due to A. lumbricoides\", and successfully treated with mebendazole 2x100 mg/day for three days. Loeffler's pneumonia should be considered when patients with bronchial asthma and pneumonia do not respond to specific treatment in developing countries. Radiological investigations may be available in the diagnosis of parasitic infections. In this case, early diagnosis by radiologic methods have prevented unnecessary drug use and related complications.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412873","annotations":[{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.897508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood film","weight":0.722247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Wheeze","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.580781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mebendazole","weight":0.383604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebendazole"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.355117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.18786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.177946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Empiricism","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"}]}
