{"id":23593,"title":"GeneXpert MTB/RIF version G4 for identification of rifampin-resistant tuberculosis in a programmatic setting.","abstract":"A recent Cochrane review estimated GeneXpert MTB/RIF specificity for rifampin resistance as 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 97 to 99), based on results from earlier test versions. The measured positive predictive value of the new generation test from programmatic implementation in Cape Town, South Africa, was 99.5% (95% CI, 98.5 to 100), confirming excellent specificity.
