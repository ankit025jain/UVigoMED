{"id":41747,"title":"Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy--the learning curve and the role of left hepatic inflow occlusion.","abstract":"To investigate the learning curve of laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLLS), and the role of left hepatic inflow occlusion (LHIO) in LLLS.41 consecutive cases of solid lesion in left lateral section underwent LLLS between August 2011 and August 2012. LHIO was conducted in 21 cases.The overall median operative time and blood loss were 160 min (range, 80-290 min) and 80 mL (range, 20-00 mL), respectively. The median operative time and blood loss were significantly reduced in later 21 cases compared with early 20 cases (110 min vs. 195 min, 40 mL vs. 265 mL, respectively). Compared with the group of cases that did not undergo LHIO, the median operative time and blood loss were significantly reduced (130 min vs. 185 min, 50 mL vs. 290 mL, respectively) in the group of cases that underwent LHIO, while the elevation of transaminase at postoperative day 2 and day 5 were of no significant difference between these two groups.A smooth learning curve can be achieved for LLLS, LHIO was associated with reduced operative time and blood loss without increasing the risk of postoperative liver function impairment.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901153","annotations":[{"name":"Liver","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.351098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.253147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"265","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/265"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Learning curve","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve"}]}
