{"id":56448,"title":"[Morphological characteristics of the macula in patients with retinal vein occlusion before and after the treatment: preliminary results].","abstract":"The article presents examination results of 26 patients with macular edema (ME) due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) before and 1 month after an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (Lucentis). Besides routine assessment, retinal spectral-domain optical coherent tomography (OCT) was performed in all cases. In accordance with derived OCT patterns of macular edema the patients were devided into two groups: swelling of the inner and outer retinal layers with serous detachment of neuroepithelium (group 1) and intraretinal edema with pseudocysts (group 2). It is shown that initial OCT features of retina in patients with ME due to RVO are prognostic for treatment results (serous retinal detachment may serve as a preventing factor of photoreceptor damage) and that visual improvement in patients with ME and serous detachment of neuroepithelium anticipates morphological changes.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684060","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.663739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.398374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.382168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.377186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.364956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.341876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.205461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Pseudocyst","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocyst"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Royal Victorian Order","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Chronic fatigue syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome"}]}
