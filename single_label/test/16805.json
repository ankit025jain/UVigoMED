{"id":16805,"title":"An interferon-gamma release assay test performs well in routine screening for tuberculosis.","abstract":"A positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is regarded as proof of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We conducted an evaluation of the IGRA test \"T-SPOT.TB\" to test its performance during clinical routine use by analysing the positivity rate and odds, effect of season and sensitivity.Data from T-SPOT.TB testing together with age and test indications (anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) candidate, contact investigation or suspicion of tuberculosis (TB)) were combined with mycobacteria culture results.A total of 1,809 patients were tested. Conclusive results were achieved for 1,780 patients (98.4%). Among these, 4.6% of anti-TNF? candidates, 19.3% of contacts and 24.4% of TB suspects tested positive. Compared with anti-TNF? candidates, the odds for a positive result were significantly higher for contact investigations (odds ratio (OR), mean (95% confidence interval): 4.93 (3.11-7.81)) and TB suspects (OR: 6.83 (4.33-10.77)). Elevated odds of an inconclusive test were found during autumn and winter periods (OR: 2.53 (1.58-4.05)) and for patients > 75 years of age (OR: 2.66 (1.43-4.94)) and < 6 years of age (OR: 3.35 (1.58-7.09)). In all, 41 of 43 culture-verified M. tuberculosis infections tested positive with one false negative.During routine testing, inconclusive tests were rare, but more frequent during autumn/winter periods and for patients < 6 and > 75 years of age. The T-SPOT.TB showed a high sensitivity in culture-verified TB, although false negative results did occur.not relevant.not relevant.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947627","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.842185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.782794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.74127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.59441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.524721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.510493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.458022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.330998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0441596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Alpha","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha"},{"name":"Autumn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"780","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/780"},{"name":"584","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/584"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Season (sports)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_(sports)"},{"name":"Nokia 3310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310"},{"name":"Tuberculosis diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_diagnosis"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
