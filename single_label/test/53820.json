{"id":53820,"title":"Is diabetes patients' knowledge of laboratory tests for monitoring blood glucose levels associated with better glycaemic control?","abstract":"To determine if there is any difference in indices of glycaemic control between type-2 diabetes patients who knew the laboratory tests for monitoring blood glucose and their peers who did not know.Eighty-nine type-2 diabetes patients were studied after an overnight fast. The patients' bio-data, blood pressure, anthropometric indices and baseline biochemical parameters and glycated haemoglobin A?c (HbA?c) were measured. After a breakfast of stewed boiled rice, a 2-hour postprandial blood glucose was measured and a questionnaire administered.The patients' mean?±?SD HbA1c level was 8.6?±?2.4% and none of the patients knew about HbA1c test for monitoring glycaemic control. Interestingly, patients who knew about fasting blood glucose test had significantly lower HbA?c values than their counterparts who did not know (8.1?±?2.2 vs. 9.1?±?2.5%, p?<?0.05).Diabetes self-management education incorporating laboratory-based information may assist to prevent poor glycaemic control in developing countries with increasing reports of hyperglycaemic emergencies.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494805","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.700699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.647588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.547758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.334872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.308728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.201662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.17521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Boiling","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling"},{"name":"Stew","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew"},{"name":"Biodata","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodata"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Breakfast","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Acetyl","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyl"}]}
