{"id":67396,"title":"Clinical pharmacology of an atrasentan and docetaxel regimen in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.","abstract":"This study was conducted to evaluate potential pharmacokinetic interactions between docetaxel and atrasentan as part of a phase I/II clinical trial.Patients with prostate cancer were treated with intravenous docetaxel (60-75 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks and oral atrasentan (10 mg) daily starting on day 3 of cycle 1 and then given continuously. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs were evaluated individually (cycle 1, day 1 for docetaxel; day 21 for atrasentan) and in combination (cycle 2, day 1 for both drugs). Pharmacogenomics of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) were also explored.Paired pharmacokinetic data sets for both drugs were evaluable in 21 patients. Atrasentan was rapidly absorbed and plasma concentrations varied over a fourfold range at steady state within a typical patient. The median apparent oral clearance of atrasentan was 17.4 L/h in cycle 1 and was not affected by docetaxel administration (p = 0.9). Median systemic clearance of docetaxel was 51.1 L/h on the first cycle and significantly slower (p = 0.01) compared with that obtained during co-administration of atrasentan, 61.6 L/h. Docetaxel systemic clearance in cycle 1 was 70.0 L/h in patients homozygous for a variant allele in AAG compared with 44.5 L/h in those with at least one wild-type allele (p = 0.03).Genetic polymorphism in AAG may explain some inter-patient variability in docetaxel pharmacokinetics. The systemic clearance of docetaxel is increased by approximately 21 % when given concomitantly with atrasentan; however, atrasentan pharmacokinetics does not appear to be influenced by docetaxel administration.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619498","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacogenomics","weight":0.940946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.832248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.766591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.745661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.685154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.59665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.268749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.227476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.124933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical pharmacology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pharmacology"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Steady state","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0106373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
