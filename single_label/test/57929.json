{"id":57929,"title":"[Delayed delivery in a triplet pregnancy--a case report].","abstract":"In multiple pregnancy the following may be considered to delay the delivery: bed rest, antibiotics, tocolytics, steroids, and, possibly cervical cerclage. Analysis of uterine contraction intensity reevaluation of the chorion and the amnion, as well as monitoring of the mother and the fetus are also very important. Clinical and laboratory parameters ought to be carefully monitored to prevent intra-amniotic infection. We present a case of a delayed delivery in a trichorionic, triamniotic, triplet pregnancy after IVF. The first and the second fetuses were delivered spontaneously at 23 and 26 weeks of gestation, respectively. The third fetus was delivered by a cesarean section at 26 weeks of gestation. The delay between the first and the second/third fetuses was 18 days. Only the second child survived. At present, the psychomotor development of the infant is considered as normal.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029814","annotations":[{"name":"Amnion","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnion"},{"name":"Chorion","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorion"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.831245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.792711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Cervical cerclage","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cerclage"},{"name":"Uterine contraction","weight":0.784752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_contraction"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.727534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Bed rest","weight":0.720168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_rest"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.268427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
