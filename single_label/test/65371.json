{"id":65371,"title":"A new sesquiterpene from the Hainan gorgonian Menella kanisa Grassoff.","abstract":"Chemical investigation of the gorgonian Menella kanisa Grassoff collected from the South China Sea led to the isolation of a new sesquiterpene, menecubebane A (1), together with three known compounds, 8-methoxy-trans-calamenene (2), 8,9-dihydro-linderazulene (3) and (3?)-oleanan-3-ol (4). The structure of 1 was determined by detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data especially the NOESY spectrum. All the compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic, brine shrimp lethal and antifouling activities.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854416","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.523648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Shrimp","weight":0.427131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp"},{"name":"Brine","weight":0.365993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.298455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"South China Sea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea"},{"name":"Hainan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan"},{"name":"Brine shrimp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_shrimp"},{"name":"Gorgonian","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgonian"},{"name":"Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Sesquiterpene","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquiterpene"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"China Seas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Seas"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Northern and southern China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_1"},{"name":"Biofouling","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofouling"}]}
