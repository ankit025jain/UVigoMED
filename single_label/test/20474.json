{"id":20474,"title":"Antibody persistence and booster response of a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine in adolescents.","abstract":"To evaluate the tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Siena, Italy) administered 3 years after primary vaccination of adolescents enrolled in a phase 3 study with either MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D (Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania).A total of 730 healthy adolescents participated, including 622 initial study participants who received primary vaccination with MenACWY-CRM (n = 367) or MenACWY-D (n = 255) 3 years previously and 108 age-matched vaccine-naïve controls. A subset of MenACWY-CRM (n = 83) and MenACWY-D (n = 77) recipients were administered a MenACWY-CRM booster dose 3 years postprimary vaccination. Immunogenicity prior to and after the booster dose of MenACWY-CRM was measured by serum bactericidal assay with human complement (hSBA). Local and systemic reactions and adverse events were monitored in subjects receiving the booster dose.At 3 years postprimary vaccination, 64%, 82%, and 65% of subjects initially vaccinated with MenACWY-CRM (n = 367) showed hSBA titers ?8 against serogroups C, W-135, and Y, respectively; this was lower for serogroup A (28%). Significantly more MenACWY-CRM recipients had hSBA titers ?8 for serogroups W-135 and Y than MenACWY-D recipients (n = 255). A MenACWY-CRM booster dose resulted in 99%-100% of subjects demonstrating hSBA titers ?8 against all serogroups, irrespective of primary vaccination (MenACWY-CRM, n = 83; MenACWY-D, n = 77). The booster dose was well tolerated without significant adverse events.MenACWY-CRM can be used to boost adolescents who have received a primary vaccination with either MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657122","annotations":[{"name":"Meningococcal vaccine","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_vaccine"},{"name":"Novartis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Sanofi Pasteur","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi_Pasteur"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"Sanofi","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.641002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Louis Pasteur","weight":0.534238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.514899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Swiftwater, Pennsylvania","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftwater,_Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.294467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
