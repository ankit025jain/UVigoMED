{"id":68981,"title":"Prooxidative-antioxidative balance of cells in different types of renal replacement therapy.","abstract":"Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) are exposed to increased oxidative stress and disturbances manifesting in the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative defence system. The object of the research was to assess the differences between conservative treatment, peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis in moderating cellular antioxidative agents.The group examined comprised 145 patients. The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained using kinetic methods. The spectrophotometric method established the concentrations of reduced glutathione, albumin, uric acid, glucose, total protein and lipids.The type of treatment determined significant changes in antioxidative enzyme activities and concentrations of non-enzymatic antioxidative compounds.Peritoneal dialysis provides better antioxidant protection than other types of therapy in CKD and should be considered as first-choice treatment despite more metabolic disorders.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital
