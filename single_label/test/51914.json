{"id":51914,"title":"Concise review: pluripotent stem cell-based regenerative applications for failing ?-cell function.","abstract":"Diabetes engenders the loss of pancreatic ?-cell mass and/or function, resulting in insulin deficiency relative to the metabolic needs of the body. Diabetic care has traditionally relied on pharmacotherapy, exemplified by insulin replacement to target peripheral actions of the hormone. With growing understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic disease, alternative approaches aiming at repair and restoration of failing ?-cell function are increasingly considered as complements to current diabetes therapy regimens. To this end, emphasis is placed on transplantation of exogenous pancreas/islets or artificial islets, enhanced proliferation and maturation of endogenous ? cells, prevention of ?-cell loss, or fortified renewal of ?-like-cell populations from stem cell pools and non-?-cell sources. In light of emerging clinical experiences with human embryonic stem cells and approval of the first in-human trial with induced pluripotent stem cells, in this study we highlight advances in ?-cell regeneration strategies with a focus on pluripotent stem cell platforms in the context of translational applications.
