{"id":59304,"title":"[Declarative survey about postpartum haemorrhage management by anaesthesiologists in Pays de la Loire area (France): what's the adherence to clinical practice guidelines?].","abstract":"To assess the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) by anaesthesiologists in Pays de la Loire area.A declarative survey was conducted from November 2011 to January 2012 with an online questionnaire to assess prevention and PPH specific care and to clarify the PPH transfusion practices and interest of new therapies. Nine indicators of adherence to clinical practice guidelines were selected to distinguish two groups: one group \"adhering to the RCP\" and another \"not adhering to the RCP\".Response rate 53%. One hundred and one responses were analyzed. Use of a collection bag graded blood receipt pockets 93%, start time of PPH noted: 76%, leaf specific monitoring: 67%, management of the third part of the work: 78%. The evacuation of the placenta is performed within 30minutes in 75% of cases. The transfusion strategy happens early (92% before the biological assessment results) and \"aggressive\" (ratio RCB/FFP is 1/1 for 72%). The use of tranexamic acid is not systematic (53%). Seventy-nine percent of respondents adhere to the RCP. Practitioners in maternity level 1 (with few deliveries) don't follow these RCP as much.Some inappropriate practices remain in structures not used to support them. The use of new therapies remain controversial. The priority at this time is the implementation and enforcement of the current RCP, not their modifications.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836116","annotations":[{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.721393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"France","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.164198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.114522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Pays de la Loire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pays_de_la_Loire"},{"name":"Tranexamic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranexamic_acid"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Postpartum hemorrhage","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"One Hundred and One Dalmatians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_and_One_Dalmatians"},{"name":"Declarative programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Royal College of Physicians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians"},{"name":"Computer-assisted web interviewing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_web_interviewing"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"},{"name":"Loire","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
