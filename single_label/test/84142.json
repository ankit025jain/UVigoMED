{"id":84142,"title":"Human skeletal muscle metabolic economy in vivo: effects of contraction intensity, age, and mobility impairment.","abstract":"We tested the hypothesis that older muscle has greater metabolic economy (ME) in vivo than young, in a manner dependent, in part, on contraction intensity. Twenty young (Y; 24±1 yr, 10 women), 18 older healthy (O; 73±2, 9 women) and 9 older individuals with mild-to-moderate mobility impairment (OI; 74±1, 7 women) received stimulated twitches (2 Hz, 3 min) and performed nonfatiguing voluntary (20, 50, and 100% maximal; 12 s each) isometric dorsiflexion contractions. Torque-time integrals (TTI; Nm·s) were calculated and expressed relative to maximal fat-free muscle cross-sectional area (cm2), and torque variability during voluntary contractions was calculated as the coefficient of variation. Total ATP cost of contraction (mM) was determined from flux through the creatine kinase reaction, nonoxidative glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and used to calculate ME (Nm·s·cm(-2)·mM ATP(-1)). While twitch torque relaxation was slower in O and OI compared with Y (P?0.001), twitch TTI, ATP cost, and economy were similar across groups (P?0.15), indicating comparable intrinsic muscle economy during electrically induced isometric contractions in vivo. During voluntary contractions, normalized TTI and total ATP cost did not differ significantly across groups (P?0.20). However, ME was lower in OI than Y or O at 20% and 50% MVC (P?0.02), and torque variability was greater in OI than Y or O at 20% MVC (P?0.05). These results refute the hypothesis of greater muscle ME in old age, and provide support for lower ME in impaired older adults as a potential mechanism or consequence of age-related reductions in functional mobility.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
