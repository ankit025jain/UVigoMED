{"id":8578,"title":"Epidermal growth factor and erythropoietin infusion accelerate functional recovery in combination with rehabilitation.","abstract":"Rehabilitation is the only treatment option for chronic stroke deficits, but unfortunately, it often provides incomplete recovery. In this study, a novel combination of growth factor administration and rehabilitation therapy was used to facilitate functional recovery in a rat model of cortical stroke.Ischemia was induced via injection of endothelin-1 into the sensorimotor cortex. This was followed by either a 2-week infusion of epidermal growth factor and erythropoietin or artificial cerebrospinal fluid into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. Two weeks after ischemia, animals began an 8-week enriched rehabilitation program. Functional recovery was assessed after ischemia using the Montoya staircase-reaching task, beam-traversing, and cylinder test of forelimb asymmetry.The combination of growth factor infusion and rehabilitation led to a significant acceleration in recovery in the staircase task. When compared with controls, animals receiving the combination treatment attained significant recovery of function at 4 weeks after stroke, whereas those receiving rehabilitation alone did not recover until 10 weeks. Significant recovery was also observed on the beam-traversing and cylinder tasks.Combining behavioral rehabilitation with growth factor infusion accelerates motor recovery. These data suggest a promising new avenue of combination therapies that may have the potential to reduce the rehabilitation time necessary to recover from sensorimotor deficits arising from stroke.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763928","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.709257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Motor cortex","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.653812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.576026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.458458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.4191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Lateral ventricles","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_ventricles"},{"name":"Physical medicine and rehabilitation","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.210018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0808391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Ipsilateral","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsilateral"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
