{"id":81519,"title":"Methods for assessment of dental erosion.","abstract":"Various assessment techniques have been applied to evaluate the loss of dental hard tissue and the surface-softened zone in enamel induced by erosive challenges. In this chapter, the most frequently adopted techniques for analyzing the erosively altered dental hard tissues are reviewed, such as profilometry, measuring microscope techniques, microradiography, scanning electron microscopy, atom force microscopy, nano- and microhardness tests and iodide permeability test. Moreover, methods for chemical analysis of minerals dissolved from dental hard tissue are discussed. It becomes evident that the complex nature of erosive mineral loss and dissolution might not be comprehended by a single technique, but needs application of different approaches for full understanding.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993262","annotations":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Atom","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.579824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Permeability (electromagnetism)","weight":0.554665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.254226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.174546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.170291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.0635619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Acid erosion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_erosion"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
