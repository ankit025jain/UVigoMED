{"id":62782,"title":"Mature results of a phase II study of rituximab therapy for nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"Universal expression of CD20 by malignant cells in nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) led us to evaluate rituximab (R) as a therapeutic option.Patients with previously treated or newly diagnosed NLPHL were treated with R (375 mg/m(2) once per week for 4 weeks) or, after a protocol amendment, with R plus R maintenance (MR; administered once every 6 months for 2 years). Primary and secondary outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR), respectively.A total of 39 patients were enrolled (R, n = 23; R + MR, n = 16). After four once-per-week treatments, ORR was 100% (complete response, 67%; partial response, 33%). At median follow-ups of 9.8 years for R and 5 years for R + MR, median PFS were 3 and 5.6 years (P = .26), respectively; median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Estimated 5-year PFS and OS for patients treated with R versus R + MR were 39.1% (95% CI, 23.5 to 65.1) and 95.7% (95% CI, 87.7 to 100) versus 58.9% (95% CI, 38.0 to 91.2) and 85.7% (95% CI, 69.2 to 100), respectively. Nine of 23 patients experiencing relapse had evidence of transformation to aggressive B-cell lymphoma; six of these patients had infradiaphragmatic involvement at study entry.R is an active agent in NLPHL. Although responses are not durable in most patients, a significant minority experience remissions lasting > 5 years. R + MR results in a nonsignificant increase in PFS compared with R. R may be considered in the relapsed setting for NLPHL. The potential for transformation of NLPHL to aggressive B-cell lymphoma underscores the importance of rebiopsy and long-term follow-up.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516013","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.728281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.515674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.346209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"375","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/375"},{"name":"Universal Studios","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Office of Rail Regulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Rail_Regulation"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Alimony","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"}]}
