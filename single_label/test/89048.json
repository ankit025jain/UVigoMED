{"id":89048,"title":"[Use of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) for the Treatment of Pseudarthroses - Efficiency and Therapy Failure].","abstract":"In the therapy for pseudarthroses of the proximal tibia, the human recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 and BMP-7) have been used for several years. Despite their limited and specified use as local mediators of bone healing, no conclusions regarding the therapeutic success can be made beforehand. The regulatory mechanisms have turned out to be much more complex and patient-specific than had been assumed before. To help understand the cell biological processes (signalling) and the current possibilities of predicting a successful use of BMP, this article summarises the relevant findings.
