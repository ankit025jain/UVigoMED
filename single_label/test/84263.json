{"id":84263,"title":"Evaluating the efficacy of Tui Na in treatment of childhood anorexia: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Medical practitioners are now seeing more children younger than 15 y who are developing childhood anorexia. Hua Tuo chiropractic treatments are an ancient and practical massage therapy and are a type of Tui Na therapy, which has been used for curing childhood anorexia for thousands of years in China. Research literature suggests that chiropractic care produces outcomes at least comparable with alternative treatments.The research team intended to perform a systematic review to identify and synthesize evidence on the efficacy of Tui Na for treatment of childhood anorexia.Systematic searches were conducted for studies evaluating Tui Na therapy in electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Midwives Information and Resource Service, the Health Management Information Consortium, the Health Management and Information Service, PubMed, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database VIP, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register-from inception to November 2011. The research team hand-searched reference lists and journals, extracted data from the papers, and assessed the quality of the research.Participants of the reviewed studies were infants and children younger than 15 y.Of the 109 papers identified, 3 papers reported on randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) involving 332 patients; 45 covered cohort or quasi-experimental studies; and 61 discussed nonintervention studies. Meta-analysis results from the 3 RCTs showed that Tui Na can improve the curative effect compared with oral medicine that is used for infants and young children with anorexia and can also increase a child's weight.The level of evidence reported was mixed, but given the available evidence, the research team concluded that Tui Na therapy was a viable intervention that could benefit infants and young children with anorexia. No serious adverse events were reported. Larger randomized, controlled trials are required to explore the effects of Tui Na therapy for treatment of childhood anorexia further.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and
