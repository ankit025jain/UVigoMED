{"id":87562,"title":"[Workload measurement scales to severe burn patient].","abstract":"To provide human resources appropriately in a unit is necessary to have measurement scales that assess workloads most accurate as possible. In this article, we have review in various databases most used scales and have found the lack of a specific scale for burn patients. Within clinical practice, burned patient is included in \"critical patient\" category, so the workloads evaluation uses validated scales for intensive care units (ICU). But the burn patient, in addition to the care of a critically ill patient themselves, requires a series of specific care that consume a lot of time nursing. In order to find a manpower use score that fit as much as possible the characteristic nurse activity in a burns units (UGQ), there has been a description of the used scales in critical patients and we propose the most important aspects to be included in a future specific scale for severe burns.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087310","annotations":[{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.280357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.217405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Religious order","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_order"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Workload","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
