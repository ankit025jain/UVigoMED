{"id":88775,"title":"Commemorative tattoos as markers for anniversary reactions and suicide.","abstract":"Anniversary reactions include physical and/or psychiatric responses to the anniversary of the death of a person who was significant to the decedent. In the most extreme cases this may result in suicide. Two cases of suicide are reported to demonstrate the association with specific commemorative tattoos. Case 1: A 19-year-old man was found hanging by the neck by an electric flex in a shed. A commemorative tattoo had the name of his brother who had committed suicide by hanging in the same shed 9 years and 2 days previously. Case 2: A 47-year-old woman was found hanging by the neck by a rope attached to a metal beam in a shed at her home address. A commemorative tattoo had the name of her daughter who had committed suicide by hanging in the same shed 1 year and 5 days previously. Tattooing may record significant life events and so may be useful in a forensic context in helping to identify an unknown decedent. In cases of apparent suicide, correlating the details of a tattoo at autopsy with the available history or the date of death may also provide useful information that helps to clarify reasons for the event, as well as providing data on the incidence of significant anniversary reactions involving lethal self harm.
