{"id":28595,"title":"Correlates of sexual risk among sexual minority and heterosexual South African youths.","abstract":"We explored psychosocial correlates of sexual risk among heterosexual and sexual minority youths (SMYs) in Johannesburg, South Africa. Young people 16 to 18 years old (n = 822) were administered surveys assessing demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, mental health, and parent-child communication. Adjusted multivariate regressions examining correlates of sexual risk revealed that SMYs had more sexual partners than heterosexual youths (B = 3.90; SE = 0.95; P < .001) and were more likely to engage in sex trading (OR = 3.11; CI = 1.12-8.62; P < .05). South African SMYs are at increased risk relative to their heterosexual peers.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832149","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.699302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.653954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.588761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.552825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.533579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.494161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.427477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.419774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.413174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.375564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.352134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.311533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.244841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Trade","weight":0.118236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"},{"name":"Johannesburg","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg"},{"name":"Sexual partner","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_partner"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
