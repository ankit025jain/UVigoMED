{"id":15032,"title":"Nanocarriers for vascular delivery of anti-inflammatory agents.","abstract":"There is a need for improved treatment of acute vascular inflammation in conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, acute lung injury, sepsis, and stroke. The vascular endothelium represents an important therapeutic target in these conditions. Furthermore, some anti-inflammatory agents (AIAs) (e.g., biotherapeutics) require precise delivery into subcellular compartments. In theory, optimized delivery to the desired site of action may improve the effects and enable new mechanisms of action of these AIAs. Diverse nanocarriers (NCs) and strategies for targeting them to endothelial cells have been designed and explored for this purpose. Studies in animal models suggest that delivery of AIAs using NCs may provide potent and specific molecular interventions in inflammatory pathways. However, the industrial development and clinical translation of complex NC-AIA formulations are challenging. Rigorous analysis of therapeutic/side effect and benefit/cost ratios is necessary to identify and optimize the approaches that may find clinical utility in the management of acute inflammation.","date":"2014-01-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24392694","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.594972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.497689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"},{"name":"Nanomedicine","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.30764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
