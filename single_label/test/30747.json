{"id":30747,"title":"A comparison of treatment outcomes for adolescent community reinforcement approach participants with and without co-occurring problems.","abstract":"This study examined the relationship between Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) participation with treatment engagement, retention, and satisfaction, and with substance use and emotional problem outcomes. Participants had substance use disorders (SUD) only or co-occurring substance use and psychiatric problems. Those with co-occurring problems reported more days of substance use and emotional problems at intake to treatment than those with SUD only. All groups received equivalent exposure to A-CRA during treatment implementation. At the 12-month follow-up, adolescents classified as externalizers (n = 468) or those with both externalizing and internalizing problems (n = 674) had significantly greater improvement in their days of abstinence and substance problems relative to adolescents with substance use disorders only (n = 666). Additionally, adolescents reporting symptoms of internalizing (n = 154), externalizing, or both externalizing and internalizing disorders had significantly greater improvements in days of emotional problems relative to adolescents with SUD only.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462478","annotations":[{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.683733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.548814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Internalization","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalization"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Community reinforcement and family training","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_reinforcement_and_family_training"},{"name":"Engagement","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"674","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/674"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting_and_abstinence_in_the_Roman_Catholic_Church"},{"name":"Australian Cultivar Registration Authority","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cultivar_Registration_Authority"},{"name":"Externalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externalization"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
