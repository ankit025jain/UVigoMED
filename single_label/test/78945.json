{"id":78945,"title":"[The methodology of clinical research in late 18th and early 19th Geneva: the case of group].","abstract":"In the history of the clinic, the introduction of quantitative methods in mid-19th century medicine was obviously of great epistemological importance. The controversy about Louis's \"numerical method\" in the 1830's was an essential step in medical statistics. This paper deals with three Genevan dissertations from 1809 submitted to the prize essay contest on croup announced by Napoleon. It shows that collecting and comparing medical cases was practised well before 1830. An analysis of the numerical methods used by the Geneva physicians reveals international cultural influences. The awareness of the potential of numbers in medicine was increasing but marked by difficulties.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527559","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Epistemology","weight":0.778803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"History","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.445806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"Thesis","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis"},{"name":"Napoleon","weight":0.435634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.240731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Geneva","weight":0.211611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Essay","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Croup","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croup"},{"name":"Medical statistics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_statistics"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"1809","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1809"},{"name":"1830s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1830s"},{"name":"1830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1830"},{"name":"Prize","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize"},{"name":"Culture of Venezuela","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Venezuela"}]}
