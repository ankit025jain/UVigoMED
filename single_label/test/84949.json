{"id":84949,"title":"Direct anterior total hip arthroplasty yields more rapid voluntary cessation of all walking aids: a prospective, randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"This study sought to prospectively examine the clinical and radiographic differences between direct anterior (DA-THA) and mini-posterior approach total hip arthroplasty (MPA-THA). Fifty-four patients were prospectively randomized to either MPA or DA-THA. Patient recorded diaries were collected. Radiographs were reviewed. SF-36, WOMAC and HHS scores were tabulated. Time to ambulation without any assistive device favored DA-THA (22 vs. 28 days, P=0.04). Three week SF mental scores favored MPA-THA (60.66 vs. 58.43, P=0.01). In a randomized prospective trial, patients undergoing DA-THA voluntarily quit use of all walking aids on average 6 days earlier than patients with a MPA-THA. Little additional clinical or radiographic benefit was seen between the cohorts.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007723","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.737297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.416327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.339581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.240104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.177069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Assistive technology","weight":0.154722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"United States Department of Health and Human Services","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Yield (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(wine)"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
