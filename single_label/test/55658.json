{"id":55658,"title":"Management of residual refractive error after laser in situ keratomileusis and photorefractive keratectomy.","abstract":"To review the various steps and methods in managing residual refractive error after laser in situ keratomileusis and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).Past studies have shown the efficacy and safety of flap relifts over recuts and for surface ablation over the flap. Other previous and also more recent studies show the use of a femtosecond laser for side cuts only. Recently, the creation of a femtosecond mini flap has been described. New studies also demonstrate the use of collagen cross-linking in postrefractive surgery ectasia.Residual refractive error is a known complication after both laser in situ keratomileusis and PRK. A systematic approach should be taken to manage this complication starting with a thorough evaluation to determine if an enhancement is indicated and if so, which method will be the safest and most efficacious for the patient.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837577","annotations":[{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.816971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.802062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.80179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.704236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.683964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.68362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.481512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.38888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
