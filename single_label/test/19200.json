{"id":19200,"title":"Managing Clostridium difficile infection in hospitalised patients.","abstract":"Checklists are not a new phenomenon and have been used in the aviation industry for some time as a means of ensuring safety and minimising harm. Checklists are now used commonly in health care to improve patient safety. This article describes the development and integration of a daily review checklist process to support the care and management of patients with Clostridium difficile infection in one NHS trust hospital.
