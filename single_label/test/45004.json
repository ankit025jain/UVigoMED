{"id":45004,"title":"Hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus: treatment with transarterial chemoembolization combined with sorafenib--a retrospective controlled study.","abstract":"To determine the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib (hereafter, TACE-sorafenib) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).This study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The medical records of consecutive patients with HCC and PVTT who underwent TACE-sorafenib or TACE alone from January 2010 to December 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. Sorafenib (400 mg) was administered twice daily. Outcomes of patients who underwent TACE-sorafenib were compared with outcomes of patients who underwent TACE by using the Kaplan-Meier method according to types of PVTT: PVTT in the main portal vein (type A), PVTT in the first-order portal vein branch (type B), and PVTT in second- or lower-order portal vein branches (type C).Ninety-one patients were included in the analysis; 46 patients underwent TACE-sorafenib and 45 underwent TACE. TACE-sorafenib showed significant survival benefits compared with TACE in patients with type B (median survival, 13 months vs 6 months; P = .002) or type C (median survival, 15 months vs 10 months; P = .003) PVTT. TACE-sorafenib and main PVTT were the independent prognostic factors for survival at uni- and multivariate analysis. Liver function after TACE-sorafenib worsened only in patients with main PVTT. Sorafenib-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 16 patients (35%).TACE-sorafenib side effects were acceptable, and this treatment may improve overall survival in patients with HCC with first-order or lower-branch PVTT when compared with patients who underwent TACE alone.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System
