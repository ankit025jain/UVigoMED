{"id":50457,"title":"Differential pattern for regulating insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism by osteocalcin in male and female T2DM patients.","abstract":"Osteocalcin has been reported to be relevant to glucose and lipid metabolism, indicating it may stimulate insulin secretion and improve insulin resistance. Yet the difference between male and female patients is still not clear. We aimed to investigate the difference in serum osteocalcin, and its association with glucose, lipid metabolism, pancreatic function, insulin sensitivity, and resistance in male and female middle-aged and elderly type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients.739 T2DM patients were included. After measurement of body mass index (BMI), the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin (FINS), C peptide (FC-P), 2-h post-OGTT plasma glucose (2h-PG), HbA1C, and osteocalcin were determined. Homeostasis model assessment of ?-cell function (HOMA-%B), homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-%S), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated.Females had higher osteocalcin concentration than males (P<0.05). In males, serum osteocalcin was negatively correlated with HbA1C, FPG, and 2-h PG (P<0.05), but positively with 2-h post-OGTT C peptide (2hC-P), 2-h post-OGTT serum insulin (2h-INS), and HOMA-%B (P<0.05). In females, serum osteocalcin was negatively correlated with HbA1C, FPG, triglyceride (TG), and HOMA-IR (P<0.05), but positively with 2-h C-P, 2-h INS, HOMA-%B, HOMA-%S, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (P<0.05). In all subjects, serum osteocalcin was inversely correlated with HbA1C, FPG, and 2-h PG (P<0.05), but positively with 2-h C-P, 2-h INS, HDL, and HOMA-%B (P<0.05).Osteocalcin might improve glucose metabolism through enhancing insulin secretion in males, and through increasing insulin secretion and improving insulin resistance in females with T2DM. Osteocalcin probably also plays an important role in lipid metabolism.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785155","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.800282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"C-peptide","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-peptide"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.621954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.305451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Osteocalcin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteocalcin"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
