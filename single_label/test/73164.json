{"id":73164,"title":"Spontaneous in vitro senescence of glioma cells confirmed by an antibody against IDH1R132H.","abstract":"We have recently suggested that glioblastoma cells become spontaneously senescent in cell culture conditions. The antibody specific against IDH1(R132H) offers the perfect opportunity to verify this hypothesis.We analyzed the features of senescence in 8 glioma cell cultures showing the IDH1(R132H) mutation based on combination of immunocytochemistry, enzymo-cytochemistry, BrdU incorporation assay and real-time microscopic observation.We report that glioma cells showing the IDH1(R132H) mutation become rapidly and spontaneously senescent in vitro. Senescence was observed in both classical and novel serum-free cell culture conditions. Importantly, the senescent IDH1(R132H)-positive cells showed the expression of stemness marker (SOX2).In vitro senescence appeared to be the main reason of the difficulties in any kind culturing of glioma cells. 3D cell cultures prolonged the survival and in vitro proliferation of neoplastic IDH1(R132H)-positive cells, however, did not enhance the stabilization efficiency. Senescence of glioma cells is spontaneously triggered in vitro, which offers the opportunity of potential new therapeutic strategies based on this phenomenon.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922649","annotations":[{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.777624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.730257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.678288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Bromodeoxyuridine","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromodeoxyuridine"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.293263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Delta cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_cell"},{"name":"Immunocytochemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocytochemistry"},{"name":"R132 road","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R132_road"},{"name":"SOX2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX2"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Clarification and stabilization of wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarification_and_stabilization_of_wine"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
