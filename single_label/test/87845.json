{"id":87845,"title":"Transvenous embolization of a carotid cavernous fistula complicated by a hematoma at the tentorial edge.","abstract":"Indirect (dural) carotid cavernous fistulae are generally treated by endovascular surgery primary transvenous embolization that is safe and effective. We describe here a case of a left indirect carotid cavernous fistula that presented with proptosis and eye redness. The patient underwent transvenous embolization of carotid cavernous sinus. The procedure was complicated by a haemorrhage from the cavernous sinus. The post procedural CT scan showed a haematoma at the tentorial edge. Precise diagnosis and prompt treatment could prevent severe complications.
