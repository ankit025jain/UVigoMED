{"id":79589,"title":"Immune response of ??T cells in Schistosome japonicum-infected C57BL/6 mouse liver.","abstract":"Systematic evaluation of the role of ??T cells during the Schistosoma japonicum infection has not been reported, despite the fact that ??T cells contribute to many infectious diseases in innate immunity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to observe the properties of ??T cells in the liver of C57BL/6 mice infected by S. japonicum. In this report, using immuno-fluorescent histological analysis, ??T cells were found around hepatic granulomatous. Moreover, the flow cytometry results revealed that the percentage of hepatic ??T cells increased significantly after S. japonicum infection. More interestingly, a subset of CD3(-)??TCR(+) cells were found and markedly increased after infection. Furthermore, expression of activation markers (CD25 and CD69) and cytokine profiles were detected in these hepatic CD3(+)??TCR(+) and CD3(-)??TCR(+) cells. The significantly higher level of CD69, IL-4 and IL-17 were observed in CD3(+)??TCR(+) cells after infection, suggesting that CD3(+)??TCR(+) cells instead of CD3(-)??TCR(+) cells might play a predominant role during the infection. Finally, our results indicated that the expression of NKG2D on CD3(+)??TCR(+) cells was higher than that on CD3(-)??TCR(+) cells. Collectively, ??T cells could play an important role in the liver of C57BL/6 mouse during japonicum infection.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130072","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.86325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.841156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.828879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.807432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.701147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.699695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.677403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.423625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0911197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"NKG2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKG2"},{"name":"CD69","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD69"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
