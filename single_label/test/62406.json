{"id":62406,"title":"Human herpesvirus-6 encephalopathy after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and class I human leukocyte antigen.","abstract":"Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) encephalopathy is a serious complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Although reactivation of HHV-6 is often observed after allo-HSCT, encephalopathy only affects a few patients with HHV-6 reactivation. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I is expressed by most somatic cells, and a relationship between some class I alleles and neurological diseases has been reported. The HHV-6 load at two, three, and four weeks after allo-HSCT was examined. HHV-6 encephalopathy was diagnosed from symptoms, results of cerebrospinal fluid examination, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. The relation between HHV-6 reactivation or encephalopathy and the HLA class I status of the recipients was investigated. In 130 patients, 147 allo-HSCT transplantation procedures were carried out. HHV-6 reactivation and encephalopathy occurred in 56 and nine procedures, respectively. HLA mismatch (p = 0.008) and unrelated donor (p = 0.001) were associated with HHV-6 reactivation, but not with HHV-6 encephalopathy. HHV-6 encephalopathy was more frequent in patients with HLA-B*40:06 (p = 0.027). In addition, HLA-A*26:01 and HLA-B*40:06 were found to be associated with each other (p = 0.089), while HLA-B*40:06 and HLA-C*08:01 showed a significant association (p < 0.001). The HLA class I alleles of recipients may be associated with the occurrence of HHV-6 encephalopathy after allo-HSCT.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579822","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.755604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Somatic cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.680893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.389263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Human herpesvirus 6","weight":0.132832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_herpesvirus_6"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"}]}
