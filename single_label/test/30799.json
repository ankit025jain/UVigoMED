{"id":30799,"title":"Current pharmacological treatment approaches for alcohol dependence.","abstract":"At present, the substances acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are available for pharmacotherapy in alcohol dependence, but clinical studies found only modest effect sizes of these treatment options.This article focuses on current pharmacological treatment approaches for alcohol dependence, which have been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs).Besides the opioid system modulator nalmefene, which has recently been approved as a medication for the reduction of alcohol consumption, several compounds have been investigated in patients with alcohol dependence using a randomized, placebo-controlled design. In these studies, the antiepileptic drugs topiramate and gabapentin were found to be effective in improving several drinking-related outcomes, whereas levetiracetam failed to show efficacy in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Clinical studies using (low-dose) baclofen, a selective GABA-B receptor agonist, produced conflicting results, so that results of further trials are needed. Varenicline has also shown mixed results in two RCTs, but might possibly be useful in patients with comorbid nicotine dependence. The ?1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin is currently under investigation in alcohol dependence with and without comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Finally, first clinical evidence suggests that the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron might possibly be used in future within a pharmacogenetic treatment approach in alcohol dependence.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456374","annotations":[{"name":"Disulfiram","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfiram"},{"name":"Baclofen","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclofen"},{"name":"Ondansetron","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondansetron"},{"name":"Topiramate","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiramate"},{"name":"Gabapentin","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"},{"name":"Nalmefene","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalmefene"},{"name":"Naltrexone","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Acamprosate","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acamprosate"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Varenicline","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varenicline"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.788896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.621052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.61649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.610785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.447452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Prazosin","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prazosin"},{"name":"GABAB receptor","weight":0.238263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAB_receptor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.2092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0606524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"}]}
