{"id":85924,"title":"Understanding health care personnel's attitudes toward mandatory influenza vaccination.","abstract":"This study investigated the factors influencing influenza vaccination rates among health care personnel (HCP) and explored HCP's attitudes toward a policy of mandatory vaccination.In September 2012, a 33-item Web-based questionnaire was administered to 3,054 HCP employed at a tertiary care hospital in metropolitan Detroit.There was a significant increase in the rate of influenza vaccination, from 80% in the 2010-2011 influenza season (before the mandated influenza vaccine) to 93% in 2011-2012 (after the mandate) (P < .0001). Logistic regression showed that HCP with a history of previous influenza vaccination were 7 times more likely than their peers without this history to receive the vaccine in 2011-2012. A pro-mandate attitude toward influenza vaccination was a significant predictor of receiving the vaccine after adjusting for demographics, history of previous vaccination, awareness of the hospital's mandatory vaccination policy, and patient contact while providing care (P = .01).The increased rate of influenza vaccination among HCP was driven by both an awareness of the mandatory policy and a pro-mandate attitude toward vaccination. The findings of this study call for better education of HCP on the influenza vaccine along with enforcement of a mandatory vaccination policy.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837116","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.828698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health Human Resources","weight":0.719035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Human_Resources"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.66664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"History","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Vaccination policy","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_policy"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Peer-to-peer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer"},{"name":"British Mandate for Palestine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Vaccine controversy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_controversy"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Metro Detroit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Detroit"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Hand evaluation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_evaluation"},{"name":"Detroit","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit"},{"name":"Flu season","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0131816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"}]}
