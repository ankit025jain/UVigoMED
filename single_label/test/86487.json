MARTIAL AND METHOD: Patients who were suspected of sleep disordered breathing attending the outpatient department of Siriraj Hospital and who had undergone polysomnography were recruited and asked to complete a Thai version of the Berlin questionnaire. Each participant was asked to repeat the same questionnaire over the next 2-4 weeks for test-retest reliability.One hundred and thirty-two patients completed the present study. The age range of the patients was 26-72 years (mean, 48.15 ++/- .80 years). All 10 items of the Thai version of the Berlin questionnaire were moderately correlated in internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha correlation coefficient = 0.68). The test-retest reliability of the Thai version of the Berlin questionnaire was investigated in 98 patients and demonstrated a high degree of reliability in intra class correlation (ICC = 0.97).The present study reveals, for the first time, that the Thai version of the Berlin questionnaire has satisfactory validity and reliability when compared to the original English version.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772580","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.359623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.205249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.191112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Siriraj Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siriraj_Hospital"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Alpha wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave"},{"name":"Outpatient department","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_department"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}]}
