{"id":4260,"title":"[Cognitive disorders in workers engaged into formaldehyde and methanol production].","abstract":"The authors studied cognitive functions state in workers engaged into chemical production under exposure to combination of factors with prevalent methanol and formaldehyde. Study covered 128 examinees of main occupations and 89 individuals of reference group. Through periodic medical examinations, state of cognitive functions was assessed by Montreal scale (MCA). Findings are increased serum levels of methanol and formaldehyde in the main group members. Moderate cognitive disorders of multifunctional type were seen. Associations of these disorders with acting agents were studied, and high degree of their correlations with occupation was revealed.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335424","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.761419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.527811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.465406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.360544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.345037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.17344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Chemical industry","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.0722222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Acting","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Multifunction printer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer"},{"name":"Talent agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Outline of industrial organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_industrial_organization"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"}]}
