{"id":77732,"title":"[Mastoidectomy in the treatment of secretory otitis media].","abstract":"To investigate mastoidectomy efficacy in treating secretory otitis media.Retrospective analysis of 22 cases (24 ears) with chronic secretory otitis media,20 ears were treated with intact canal wall mastoidectomy combined with facial recess opening,4 ears were treated with opened mastoid surgery,3 ears simultaneously accepted tube insertion. Ventilation tube was pulled out in 6 months. Hearing test was inspected before and after surgery.None of the patients had hearing loss, 19 ears had varying degrees of hearing improvement. Seventeen ears were type A tympanometry curve, 7 ears were C-shaped curve. No recurrence of otitis media was observed after 6 - 36 months followed-up.Mastoidectomy may improve eustachian tube function and decrease the risk of recurrence of secretory otitis media.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248254","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.7963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.596657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.583205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Hearing test","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_test"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.172222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Tympanometry","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanometry"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mastoidectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoidectomy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Tympanostomy tube","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanostomy_tube"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"}]}
