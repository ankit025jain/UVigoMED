{"id":37215,"title":"Transcatheter versus surgical closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects in children: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the surgical versus transcatheter approach to correct perimembranous ventricular septal defects (pmVSDs) in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial.pmVSD is a common congenital heart disease in children. Surgical closure of pmVSD is a well-established therapy but requires open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Although the transcatheter approach is associated with significant incidence of complete atrioventricular block, it may provide a less invasive alternative. Critical comparison of the safety and efficacy of the 2 interventions necessitates a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.Between January 2009 and July 2010, 229 children with pmVSD were randomly assigned to surgical or transcatheter intervention. Clinical, laboratory, procedural, and follow-up data over a 2-year period were compared.Neither group had mortality or major complications. However, statistical analysis of the 2 groups demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.001) in minor adverse events (32 vs. 7), quantity of blood transfused, duration of the procedure, median hospital stay, median intensive care unit stay, median hospitalization cost, and median blood loss. During a median follow-up of 2 years, the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension of both groups returned to normal and there was no difference in closure rate, adverse events, and complications between groups.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
