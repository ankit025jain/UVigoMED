{"id":12083,"title":"Glutathione pegylated liposomal methylprednisolone administration after the early phase of status epilepticus did not modify epileptogenesis in the rat.","abstract":"It has been reported that glucocorticoids (GCs) can effectively control seizures in pediatric epilepsy syndromes, possibly by inhibition of inflammation. Since inflammation is supposed to be involved in epileptogenesis, we hypothesized that treatment with GCs would reduce brain inflammation and thereby modify epileptogenesis in a rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy, in which epilepsy gradually develops after electrically induced status epilepticus (SE). To prevent the severe adverse effects that are inevitable with long-term GC treatment, we used liposome nanotechnology (G-Technology(®)) to enhance the sustained delivery to the brain. Starting 4h after onset of SE, rats were treated with glutathione pegylated liposomal methylprednisolone (GSH-PEG liposomal MP) according to a treatment protocol (1× per week; 10mg/kg) that is effective in other models of neuroinflammation. Continuous electro-encephalogram (EEG) recordings revealed that SE duration and onset of spontaneous seizures were not affected by GSH-PEG liposomal MP treatment. The number and duration of spontaneous seizures were also not different between vehicle and GSH-PEG liposomal MP-treated animals. Six weeks after SE, brain inflammation, as assessed by quantification of microglia activation, was not reduced by GSH-PEG liposomal MP-treatment. Also, neuronal cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting were not affected. Our study shows that the selected GSH-PEG liposomal MP treatment regimen that was administered beyond the acute SE phase does not reduce brain inflammation and development of temporal lobe epilepsy.
