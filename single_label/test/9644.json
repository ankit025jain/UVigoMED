{"id":9644,"title":"Metabolic studies of four soy isoflavones in rats by HPLC-HR-MS.","abstract":"In this paper, the metabolites of four soy isoflavones, daidzein, daidzin, genistein, and genistin, on perfused rat intestine-liver model were investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometer/tandem mass spectrometer. Totally 16 metabolites were detected and identified based on accurate mass, fragmentation patterns, and multiple-stage mass data (MS(n)). The metabolic site of dadzein-7-methyl ether (D-7-M) was further confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance. Methylation, glucuronide conjugation, and sulfate conjugation were the primary metabolic processes. Among them, six metabolites, daidzin-4',7-diglucoside, genistein-4'-glucoside, D-7-M, dadzein-4',7-dimethyl ether, genistein-4'-methyl ether, and genistein-7-methyl ether were detected in rats for the first time and not reported in humans. The metabolic pathways of daidzein, daidzin genistein, and genistin in rats were postulated. The biological effects of these metabolites are worthy of further investigation.
