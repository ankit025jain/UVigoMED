{"id":72594,"title":"Perfluorooctanoic acid stimulates breast cancer cells invasion and up-regulates matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 expression mediated by activating NF-?B.","abstract":"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used because of its stain-resistant and water-repellant properties. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms undergoing the stimulation effects of PFOA on cancer cell invasion and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression. Trans-well filter assay showed that PFOA exposure (?5 nM) evidently enhanced the invasion ability of the breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. Luciferase reporter assay, quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and gelatin zymography consistently demonstrated that mRNA and protein levels of MMP-2/-9 were increased in the cells after PFOA treatment (P<0.05 each). Western blotting revealed that PFOA could activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-?B) by accelerating NF-?B translocation into the nucleus. Furthermore, addition of NF-?B inhibitor in culture medium could suppress the breast cancer cells invasiveness enhancement and MMP-2/-9 overexpression. This study indicates that PFOA can stimulate breast cancer cells invasion and up-regulate matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 expression mediated by activating NF-?B, which deserves more environmental health concerns.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24960061","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.728498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.713987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.685405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.661972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.590333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.189562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Perfluorooctanoic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
