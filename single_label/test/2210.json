{"id":2210,"title":"Mirizzi Syndrome: How it could be a challenge.","abstract":"Mirizzi syndrome (MS) is a rare complication of cholelithiasis. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients with obstructive jaundice. Failure to recognize this condition preoperatively can result in a major bile duct injury. In this study, our aim is to describe the clinical presentations, investigations, operative details, endoscopic management and the complications of both procedures.We performed a retrospective analysis on the records of 65 patients with MS. All patients had a cholangiogram; either magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). We used a McSherry classification to divide patients with MS into type I MS and type II MS. Those patients had undergone different types of management either ERCP and/or surgery.The incidence of MS was 0.98% from a total of 4600 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy. From 65 patients with MS, 20 patients underwent ERCP where it was the sole treatment (18 of which had stent while 2 had the stone extracted). The overall surgically treated patients were 45 (23 patients with preliminary ERCP with stent and 22 patients with primary surgical treatment), 18 patients had MS type I while 27 patients had MS type II. Patients with different types of MS underwent different types of surgical procedures.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436279","annotations":[{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.769465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.731918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.314173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.2457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.113149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Cholangiography","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiography"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Medical classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_classification"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"}]}
