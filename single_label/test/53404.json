{"id":53404,"title":"[Association of diabetes type 2 and depression - behavioural and biological aspects].","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes and depression often appear together. Although health behaviour and risk factors partially explain this association, other potential mechanisms have yet to be elucidated.Explorative literature research for reviews on the topic in PubMed. Additional key-word guided research for studies in PubMed and Cochrane Library employing the keywords \"diabetes\" AND \"depression\" in combination with identified relevant single aspects (MeSH-terms) for certain neuroendocrine alterations, neuropathological und neurobiochemestric changes as well as the role of antidepressants.There are no satisfying explanatory models for the complex interaction of both diseases concerning behavioural factors and pathophysiological changes. Currently there are only many single aspects of shared or interacting pathophysiology or behaviour conspicuity.The objective of this review is to summarize these aspects and their contributions to the interacting pathophysiology of the two diseases.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519113","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.824458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.654808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.614026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Neuropathology","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Keywords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
