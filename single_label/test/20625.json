{"id":20625,"title":"Rate and pattern of antibiotic resistance in microbiological cultures of sepsis patients in a low-middle-income country's ICU.","abstract":"In this prospective, observational study, the rate of antibiotic resistance in cultures sampled from sepsis patients was determined in an intensive care unit of a low-middle income country.Critically ill patients suffering from bacterial sepsis were eligible for enrollment. Aside from demographic, disease-related and sepsis-specific parameters, the type of microbiological sample and cultured microorganism as well as the resistance pattern (extensively resistant bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria) were documented. Descriptive statistical methods, parametric and non-parametric tests were used.215 sepsis patients were included. 193 ofthe 410 cultured organisms (47.1%) showed antibiotic resistance [extensively resistant bacteria, n = 90 (11%); multi-drug resistant bacteria, n = 103 (25.1%)]. 51.6% of the patients were infected by > or = 1 resistant bacteria. Bacteria with an exceptionally high rate of antibiotic resistance were Acinetobacter baumannii (90%), Enterobacter spp (60%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (60%). Patients infected with resistant bacteria more often received inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy (36.9 vs. 13.5%, p < 0.001), required mechanical ventilation (66.7 vs. 42.3%, p < 0.001) and renal replacement therapy (28.8 vs. 9.6%, p < 0.001) more frequently, and had a longer stay in the intensive care unit [5 (3-9.5) vs. 5 (2-8)%, p < 0.001] than patients with sepsis due to non-resistant bacteria. There was a trend towards a higher mortality in patients with resistant bacteria (43.2 vs. 31.7%, p = 0.09).Resistant bacteria were detected in up to 50% of microbiological samples from critically ill sepsis patients in the intensive care unit of a low-middle-income country. Antibiotic resistance appears to be a relevant problem of sepsis management in a resource-limited setting.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649786","annotations":[{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.891971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.678215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.653499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.632776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.540243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.442905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Enterobacter","weight":0.281715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacter"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.186132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0486346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"French Resistance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Resistance"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
