{"id":59162,"title":"Treatment of climacteric symptoms in breast cancer patients: a retrospective study from a medication databank.","abstract":"Women affected by breast cancer (BC) will often go through menopause at an earlier age and display more frequent and severe symptoms than women who have a natural menopause. The safety of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and vaginal estrogens for BC survivors has been debated over time and remains unclear. Non hormonal therapies such as antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine may be useful for those patients but there are few data about their safety.This retrospective study analyses the use by BC patients of treatments known to alleviate climacteric symptoms.Post-menopausal Estrogen Receptors positive (ER+) BC patients, aged 45-69, were identified as having bought, at least once, an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or tamoxifen between the years 2000 and 2012 through a pharmaceutical databank in Belgium. Among them, we defined users of a climacteric treatment those who bought, at least once, HRT, vaginal topical estrogens, antidepressants, clonidine and gabapentine.We identified 2530 BC patients. Among them, 45% were buying a treatment known to alleviate menopausal symptoms. The majority of these treatments were non-HRT therapies. HRT and vaginal estrogens were seldom bought (respectively 1.1% and 6%), but 3% bought vaginal estrogens while buying AI. About 9.2% of tamoxifen users patients bought antidepressants implicated in tamoxifen metabolism at the same time as tamoxifen.Most BC patients follow current guidelines contra-indicating the use of HRT after BC, they use non hormonal therapies. In some cases they use unfortunately antidepressants that may alter the metabolism of tamoxifen.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852403","annotations":[{"name":"Clonidine","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine"},{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)","weight":0.810508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.744425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.672698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.198446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"}]}
