{"id":38735,"title":"Infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous return: an unusual cause of neonatal portal vein enlargement.","abstract":"We present an unusual cause of aneurysmal dilatation of portal vein in a neonate in a case of infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous return. The common descending pulmonary vein was seen joining below the diaphragm with the left branch of portal vein, which was terminating as a blind-ending, aneurysmally dilated vascular channel.
