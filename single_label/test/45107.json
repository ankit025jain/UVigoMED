{"id":45107,"title":"Incidence of complication and tumor recurrence after radiofrequency ablation in high-risk location of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.","abstract":"To evaluate complication, rate of residual, and tumor recurrence in high-risk location compared to non-high-risk location in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.Radiofrequency ablation was performed on 409 tumors in Siriraj Hospital between October 2009 and May 2012. Eighty-eight nodules in 78 atients were treated by RF ablation, which divided into high risk and non-high-risk location. Complete ablation rate, residual tumor recurrent tumor, and complication were retrospectively reviewed.HCC nodules were in non-high-risk location 34 nodules (38.6%) and in high-risk location 54 nodules (61.4%). Complete tumor ablations were done in 34 nodules (100%) of non-high-risk location group and 50 nodules (92.6%) of high-risk location group. All residual tumors were four nodules (7.2%), which located in subcapsular location. Recurrent tumors were found in six nodules (6.8%), and mean time to recurrence were 210.2 days. Early complication was 10.2% and late complication was 4.5%. The recurrent tumor and complication were not significantly different between two groups.Radiofrequency ablation is effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in high-risk location tumor There is no significant difference in complication and tumor recurrent rate between high-risk and non-high-risk group. However incidence of residual tumor is significantly increased in subcapsular location tumor","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701735","annotations":[{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.825349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.79268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.3075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0670588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Siriraj Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siriraj_Hospital"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"List of SPC high-risk days","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SPC_high-risk_days"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"}]}
