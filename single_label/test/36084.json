{"id":36084,"title":"Functional outcome at school age of preterm-born children treated with high-dose dexamethasone.","abstract":"Postnatal dexamethasone (DXM) treatment is associated with adverse motor outcome. It is largely unknown as to what extent functional outcome at school age is affected.Our first aim was to determine motor, cognitive, and behavioural outcome at school age of preterm-born children treated with high-dose DXM for pulmonary problems. Our second aim was to identify DXM-related risk factors for adverse outcome.In this cohort study, we included 53 very preterm-born children treated with DXM (starting dose 0.5mg/kg/d) after the first week of life. At the median age of 9 years, we performed a detailed neuropsychological assessment.Compared to the norm population, DXM-treated children scored worse on the Movement-ABC (abnormal fine motor, ball skills and balance: 59%, 47% and 30%, respectively). They more often had total (36%), verbal (32%) and performance IQs (55%) below 85 (P<.001, P=.002, P<.001, respectively). On each of the remaining measures, DXM-treated children scored worse than the norm population, except for verbal long-term memory and verbal recognition memory. DXM-related risk factors were associated with poorer performance.At school age, multiple domains of functional outcome were affected in DXM-treated children. Risk factors related to the use of DXM should be considered as serious potentiaters of adverse outcome in children treated with high-dose DXM.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602475","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Neuropsychological assessment","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychological_assessment"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.600262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.399276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.152562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.1201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dextromethorphan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Fine motor skill","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Ball","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Recognition memory","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_memory"}]}
