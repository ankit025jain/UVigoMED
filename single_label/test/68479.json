{"id":68479,"title":"My Road Ahead study protocol: a randomised controlled trial of an online psychological intervention for men following treatment for localised prostate cancer.","abstract":"There is a need for psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer to promote adaptive coping with the challenges and distress associated with diagnosis, treatment and recovery. In addition, interventions are needed that help to overcome barriers to psychosocial treatment such as limited face-to-face psychosocial support services, a shortage of adequately trained professionals, geographical distance, perceived and personal stigma and a preference for consumer-centric and self-directed learning. My Road Ahead is an online cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention for prostate cancer. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will evaluate the efficacy of this online intervention alone, the intervention in combination with a moderated online forum, and the moderated online forum alone.This study utilises a RCT design with three groups receiving: 1) the 6-module My Road Ahead intervention alone; 2) the My Road Ahead intervention plus a moderated online forum; and 3) the moderated online forum alone. It is expected that 150 men with localised prostate cancer will be recruited into the RCT. Online measures will assess men's psychological distress as well as sexual and relationship adjustment at baseline, post-intervention, 3 month follow-up and 6 month follow-up. The study is being conducted in Australia and participants will be recruited from April 2012 to Feb 2014. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of My Road Ahead in reducing psychological distress.To our knowledge, My Road Ahead is the first self-directed online psychological intervention developed for men who have been treated for localised prostate cancer. The RCT will assess the efficacy of this intervention in improving psychological well-being, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction and overall quality of life. If successful, this intervention could provide much needed support to men receiving treatment for localised prostate cancer in a highly accessible manner.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Identifier: ACTRN12611000278932.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517384","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.758691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.674262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.566827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.518819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.508248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.465744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.436586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.271284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.20868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.161995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"},{"name":"Orgasm","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Health effects from noise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"}]}
