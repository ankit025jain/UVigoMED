{"id":12729,"title":"Application of a new dye for near-infrared fluorescence laparoscopy of the ureters: demonstration in a pig model.","abstract":"Ureteral injury during laparoscopic colorectal surgery is a rare but serious complication with a reported incidence rate of 0.66%. The early detection and prevention of ureteral injury is clinically relevant and important. The successful use of preclinical near-infrared fluorophore CW800-CA for real-time intraoperative identification of the anatomical course of the ureters with the use of a laparoscopic fluorescence imaging system is reported.The usefulness of this new imaging technique was explored in two 35-kg pigs. Intravenous CW800-CA was administered 10 minutes before fluorescence imaging was conducted with the use of a commercially available laparoscopic fluorescence imaging system.A dose of 1 mg/mL CW800-CA (bolus injection of 3 mL) provided clear delineation of the course of both ureters by using the fluorescence mode of the laparoscope. There were no adverse reactions to the injected dye.Near-infrared fluorescence laparoscopy of the ureters, following intravenous CW800-CA administration, is easily applicable and provides real-time identification of the course of the ureters.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509470","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.671171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.54696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.447996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.385564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.349386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.308774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.155226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_correlation_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Demonstration (people)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(people)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"The CW Television Network","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW_Television_Network"}]}
