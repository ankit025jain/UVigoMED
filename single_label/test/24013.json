{"id":24013,"title":"Chromatin-mediated Candida albicans virulence.","abstract":"Candida albicans is the most prevalent human fungal pathogen. To successfully propagate an infection, this organism relies on the ability to change morphology, express virulence-associated genes and resist DNA damage caused by the host immune system. Many of these events involve chromatin alterations that are crucial for virulence. This review will focus on the studies that have been conducted on how chromatin function affects pathogenicity of C. albicans and other fungi.
