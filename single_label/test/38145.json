{"id":38145,"title":"Uricosuric drugs: the once and future therapy for hyperuricemia?","abstract":"Although uricosuric agents provide the most time-honoured approach to the control of hyperuricemia, their place in the armamentarium has been eclipsed by that of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. This review considers the potential for uricosuric agents from the perspective of recent progress in the understanding of urate transport systems.No new agents have yet become available, but promising new drugs are under development. Better understanding of the transporters URAT1 and ABCG2 in particular would appear to provide opportunities for more selective, better tolerated agents to increase the renal clearance of uric acid and thereby control hyperuricemia.Conceptually, modest inhibition of renal tubular reabsorption should provide effective relief for the millions of individuals who are now hyperuricemic and who suffer from its principal consequence, gout.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445479","annotations":[{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Hyperuricemia","weight":0.821334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperuricemia"},{"name":"Gout","weight":0.80305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.758148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.706815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Xanthine","weight":0.663507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine"},{"name":"Xanthine oxidase","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine_oxidase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Uricosuric","weight":0.457999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uricosuric"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.270016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"SLC22A12","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLC22A12"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"ABCG2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCG2"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Eclipsed conformation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipsed_conformation"},{"name":"Reabsorption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reabsorption"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"}]}
