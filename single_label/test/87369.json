{"id":87369,"title":"[Clinical analysis on replantation of severed palm in 45 patients].","abstract":"To explore methods and clinical outcomes of microsurgical technique in treating patients with severed palm.From January 2009 to December 2012,45 patients with severed palm were treated by replantation through microsurgical technique, included 37 males and 8 females, aged from 13 to 45 years old with an average of 25. Postoperative survival rate and evaluation standard of upper limb replantation function posposed by Chinese Medical Association were applied for evaluate clinical outcomes after operation.Forty-five patients with severed plam were treated by replantation. Thirty-nine patients (121 fingers) were survived,and survival rate was 87%. All patients were followed up 3 to 15.5 months with an average of 11.5 months. According to evaluation standard of upper limb replantation function posposed by Chinese Medical Association, the total score was 80.27 +/- 1.93, and 27 cases got excellent results, 8 good and 4 poor.The success of replantation of severed palm depends on grasping operation indication strictly, knowing complexity and local anatomic relationship, debridement completely during operation, making full use of remaining organization, arteriovenostomy through microsurgical technique as early as possible, constructing circulation and repairing injuried nerve rationally.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241465","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"China","weight":0.22653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Arecaceae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Prehensility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehensility"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Replantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replantation"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Rational choice theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"}]}
