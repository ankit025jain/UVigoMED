{"id":8827,"title":"Preventive effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rats.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in rats.The study included 20 Sprague-Dawley rats injected once with 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone acetate into the right gluteus medius muscle to induce osteonecrosis. Animals were divided into two equal groups; Group 1 received no prophylaxis (control group) and the Group 2 received CoQ10. Hematological examinations were performed before steroid injection (0 weeks) and at 4 weeks after steroid injection. Femoral heads were examined histologically to evaluate osteonecrosis.Changes in blood glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were less significant in the CoQ10 group. The incidence of histologic changes consistent with early osteonecrosis was lower in the CoQ10 group (2 of 10; 20%) than the control group (7 of 10; 70%).Coenzyme Q10 may be useful as a preventing agent in steroid-induced ONFH. Inhibited oxidative stress is a possible mechanism for this effect.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747633","annotations":[{"name":"Coenzyme Q10","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.784186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.780078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.244357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Gluteus medius muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteus_medius_muscle"},{"name":"3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Group 7 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_7_element"},{"name":"Gluteal muscles","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteal_muscles"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"}]}
