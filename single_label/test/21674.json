{"id":21674,"title":"Early identification and treatment of sepsis.","abstract":"Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition and is becoming increasingly frequent, yet health professionals are often unable to recognise its symptoms. It is the body's exaggerated response to infection and, if left untreated, will lead to severe sepsis, multi-organ failure and death.
