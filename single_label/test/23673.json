{"id":23673,"title":"Neisseria meningitidis B vaccines: recent advances and possible immunization policies.","abstract":"Since the development of the first-generation vaccines based on outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which were able to contain strain-specific epidemics, but were not suitable for universal use, enormous steps forward in the prevention of Neisseria meningitidis B have been made. The first multicomponent vaccine, Bexsero(Â®), has recently been authorized for use; other vaccines, bivalent rLP2086 and next-generation OMV vaccines, are under development. The new vaccines may substantially contribute to reducing invasive bacterial infections as they could cover most Neisseria meningitidis B strains. Moreover, other potentially effective serogroup B vaccine candidates are being studied in preclinical settings. It is therefore appropriate to review what has recently been achieved in the prevention of disease caused by serogroup B.
