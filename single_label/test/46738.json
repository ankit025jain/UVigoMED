{"id":46738,"title":"The expression and clinical significance of miR-132 in gastric cancer patients.","abstract":"miR-132 plays a role in regulating neuronal morphology and cellular excitability. Little is known about the effects of miR-132 in cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of miR-132 and its clinical significance in gastric cancer.Cancerous tissues and corresponding normal tissues from 79 patients with gastric cancer were examined for the expression of miR-132 using quantitative PCR and the association between miR-132 expression levels and clinicopathological factors and prognosis was analyzed.In 79 clinical samples of gastric cancer patients, miR-132 expression levels in cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in the corresponding normal tissues (P = 0.001). Higher expression levels of miR-132 were associated with more frequent lymph node metastasis (P = 0.033), more lymphatic tumor emboli (P = 0.007), and more advanced stage (P = 0.016). Additionally, expression of miR-132 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.020).miR-132 could serve as an efficient prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/8168577241196050.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621117","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.714035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.488739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.470523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Excited state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state"},{"name":"Virtual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
