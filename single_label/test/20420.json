{"id":20420,"title":"Association of pulmonary tuberculosis and dermatological conditions among patients of a rural medical college hospital.","abstract":"Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) affects a significant proportion of the population. There are many contributory aetiological factors common to tuberculosis (TB) and dermatological conditions.To study the spectrum of concurrent skin conditions in patients with PTB and to compare with patients having other diseases.All patients with PTB admitted to our Institute during the period of the study were included in the study. A comparable number of patients admitted in other departments constituted the control group. All patients were screened for skin diseases.There were 498 patients in each group, matched for age and gender. There were 126 patients with skin conditions in the study group as against 60 patients in the control group. Pityriasis versicolor was the commonest skin condition in both the groups. Whereas acniform eruptions and pruritis were more common in the control group. Pityriasis versicolor, herpes zoster, erythema nodosum and leprosy were significantly more frequent among patients.There is a high frequency of concurrent skin diseases in patient with PTB that should be managed along with it.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660561","annotations":[{"name":"Herpes zoster","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"List of cutaneous conditions","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Erythema nodosum","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_nodosum"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.470113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tinea versicolor","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea_versicolor"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.347927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.129335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Volcano","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
