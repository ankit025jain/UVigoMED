{"id":45558,"title":"Hepatitis C disease severity in living versus deceased donor liver transplant recipients: an extended observation study.","abstract":"Donor factors influence hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease severity in liver transplant (LT) recipients. Living donors, because they are typically young and have short cold ischemic times, may be advantageous for HCV-infected patients. Among HCV-infected patients in the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL) surviving >90 days and followed for a median 4.7 years, advanced fibrosis (Ishak stage ?3) and graft loss were determined. The 5-year cumulative risk of advanced fibrosis was 44% and 37% in living donor LT (LDLT) and deceased donor LT (DDLT) patients (P?=?0.16), respectively. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity at LT (hazard ratio [HR]?=?1.38 for doubling of AST, P?=?0.005) and biliary strictures (HR?=?2.68, P?=?0.0001) were associated with advanced fibrosis, but LDLT was not (HR?=?1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-1.69, P?=?0.63). The 5-year unadjusted patient and graft survival probabilities were 79% and 78% in LDLT, and 77% and 75% in DDLT (P?=?0.43 and 0.32), with 27% and 20% of LDLT and DDLT graft losses due to HCV (P?=?0.45). Biliary strictures (HR?=?2.25, P?=?0.0006), creatinine at LT (HR?=?1.74 for doubling of creatinine, P?=?0.0004), and AST at LT (HR?=?1.36 for doubling of AST, P?=?0.004) were associated with graft loss, but LDLT was not (HR?=?0.76, 95% CI: 0.49-1.18, P?=?0.23).Donor type does not affect the probability of advanced fibrosis or patient and graft survival in HCV-infected recipients. Thus, while LDLT offers the advantage of shorter wait times, there is no apparent benefit for HCV disease progression. Biliary strictures have a negative effect on HCV fibrosis severity and graft survival, and a high AST at LT may be an important predictor of fibrosis risk post-LT.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677192","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.789102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.697707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.688452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.588187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.52844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.357819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.201242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.131806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Somnambulist (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnambulist_(Angel)"}]}
