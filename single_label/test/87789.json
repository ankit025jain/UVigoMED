{"id":87789,"title":"Cortical comminution in distal radial fractures can predict the radiological outcome: a cohort multicentre study.","abstract":"This paper investigates whether cortical comminution and intra-articular involvement can predict displacement in distal radius fractures by using a classification that includes volar comminution as a separate parameter. A prospective multicentre study involving non-operative treatment of distal radius fractures in 387 patients aged between 15 and 74 years (398 fractures) was conducted. The presence of cortical comminution and intra-articular involvement according to the Buttazzoni classification is described. Minimally displaced fractures were treated with immobilisation in a cast while displaced fractures underwent closed reduction with subsequent immobilisation. Radiographs were obtained after reduction, at 10 to 14 days and after union. The outcome measure was re-displacement or union. In fractures with volar comminution (Buttazzoni type 4), 96% (53 of 55) displaced. In intra-articular fractures without volar comminution (Buttazzoni 3), 72% (84 of 117) displaced. In extra-articular fractures with isolated dorsal comminution (Buttazzoni 2), 73% (106 of 145) displaced while in non-comminuted fractures (Buttazzoni 1), 16 % (13 of 81 ) displaced. A total of 32% (53 of 165) of initially minimally displaced fractures later displaced. All of the initially displaced volarly comminuted fractures re-displaced. Displacement occurred in 31% (63 of 205) of fractures that were still in good alignment after 10 to 14 days. Regression analysis showed that volar and dorsal comminution predicted later displacement, while intra-articular involvement did not predict displacement. Volar comminution was the strongest predictor of displacement.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986954","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.725317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.497027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.435812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.348859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.319048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.303328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.291173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.260173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.154959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Stainless steel","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Comminution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comminution"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"398","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/398"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Volar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volar"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
