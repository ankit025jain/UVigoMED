{"id":46661,"title":"Soluble CD163, a macrophage activation marker, is independently associated with fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C.","abstract":"Macrophages are involved in inflammation and liver fibrosis and soluble (s)CD163 is a specific marker of activated macrophages. We investigated associations between sCD163 and biochemical and histological parameters of inflammatory activity and fibrosis in 551 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 203 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before antiviral treatment. Scheuer histological scores of activity and fibrosis were obtained. Clinical, biochemical, and metabolic parameters were recorded. We measured sCD163 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Soluble CD163 was higher in patients with HCV compared to HBV (3.6 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.5-5.4] versus 2.4 [IQR 1.8-3.6] mg/L, P < 0.001). sCD163 was associated with fibrosis stages for both HCV (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-1.61) and HBV (OR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.17-1.49) patients, with highest levels in patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. sCD163 was a marker of fibrosis independent of other biochemical parameters and known risk factors. We created two novel sCD163-based fibrosis scores, CD163-HCV-FS and CD163-HBV-FS, which showed areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74-0.83) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.79), respectively, for significant fibrosis. Compared to existing fibrosis scores, CD163-HCV-FS was significantly superior to the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) for all fibrosis stages and to FIB-4 for significant fibrosis, but CD163-HBV-FS was not.sCD163 levels are increased in patients with chronic viral hepatitis, reflecting macrophage activation. Increased sCD163 is associated with the severity of disease and predicts fibrosis. A sCD163-based fibrosis score, CD163-HCV-FS, is superior to APRI and FIB-4 for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis in patients with HCV infection.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623375","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.73296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.50697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.461438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.268286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}]}
