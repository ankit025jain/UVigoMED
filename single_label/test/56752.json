{"id":56752,"title":"Retinoschisis in the setting of Coats' disease.","abstract":"This is a report of a 5-year-old boy who presented with an exudative retinopathy consistent with Coats' disease. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the concurrent presence of retinoschisis in the same eye, adjacent to the areas of exudation and ischemia. Treatment with laser photocoagulation, corticosteroids, and anti-VEGF therapy led to the resolution of the schisis cavity 1 year later. This represents the second published account of retinoschisis in the setting of Coats' disease.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635161","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.761326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.657154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.515849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.44354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.229864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Retinoschisis","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoschisis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coats' disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coats'_disease"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Optical cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cavity"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
