{"id":78499,"title":"GSTM1 null polymorphisms is associated with laryngeal cancer risk: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Many studies have examined the association between the GSTM1 (null or non-null genotype) polymorphism and laryngeal cancer risk in various populations, but their results have been inconsistent. To assess this relationship more precisely, a meta-analysis was performed. PubMed was searched for case-control studies published up to December 2013. Data were extracted and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Ultimately, 23 studies, comprising 2,562 laryngeal cancer cases and 4,091 controls, were included. Overall, for null versus present, the pooled OR was 1.22 (95 % CI = 1.10-1.36), and the heterogeneity was found in all studies. In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant risks were found among Asians (OR = 1.71; 95 % CI = 1.34-2.19; P = 0.011 for heterogeneity) and in Caucasians (OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 1.00-1.27; P = 0.036 for heterogeneity). In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrates that the GSTM1 null gene polymorphism is an increased risk of laryngeal cancer in Asians and Caucasians.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643684","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.850585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.839916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.626518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.556754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.299438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.267804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.142609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.108802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_S-transferase_Mu_1"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/342"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Null hypothesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Area code 562","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_562"}]}
