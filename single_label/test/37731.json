{"id":37731,"title":"Orocfacial digital syndrome type II -- Mohr's syndrome.","abstract":"Orofacial digital syndromes are a heterogeneous group of rare malformative diseases, characterised by abnormalities of the oral cavity, maxillofacial region and digits. Orofacial digital syndromes are classified into ten types with orofacial digital syndrome type II, Mohr's syndrome being transmitted as autosomal recessive disorder. Here a case of a full term, female, born by lower segment caesarean section weighing 2.800 kg with respiratory distress, cyanosis, poly and syndactyly is reported.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475562","annotations":[{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.804199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.775061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Syndactyly","weight":0.73581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndactyly"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.701555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.465185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.308694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Polyphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
