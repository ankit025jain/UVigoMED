{"id":44649,"title":"[Case of brain death liver transplantation suspended because of respiratory failure after admission to the operating room].","abstract":"We experienced a case in which brain death liver transplantation was suspended after admission to the operating room because the impaired oxygenation was aggravated. A 32-year-old man (weight 70 kg, height 164 cm) who had previously undergone living donor liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome developed hepatic failure 11 months after the transplantation and was enrolled in the waiting list for brain death liver transplantation. Mechanical ventilation and blood purification therapy were performed in the intensive care unit because he was in coma and his respiratory function had gradually worsened. A brain-dead donor was identified 21 days after enrollment. The patient was transported to the operating room when the donor liver arrived at our hospital. However, the surgery was suspended because his respiratory function deteriorated further after induction of general anesthesia. A patient enrolled in the brain death transplantation list often has to wait long for a donor organ. Anesthesiologists should actively participate in the preoperative management and evaluation of a patient's general status during the waiting period.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724450","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Brain death","weight":0.870521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.800688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.680992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.579363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.514937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.434199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Living donor liver transplantation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_donor_liver_transplantation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Ritual purification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_purification"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Teleportation in fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation_in_fiction"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
