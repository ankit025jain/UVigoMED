{"id":24220,"title":"Lethal factor and anti-protective antigen IgG levels associated with inhalation anthrax, Minnesota, USA.","abstract":"Bacillus anthracis was identified in a 61-year-old man hospitalized in Minnesota, USA. Cooperation between the hospital and the state health agency enhanced prompt identification of the pathogen. Treatment comprising antimicrobial drugs, anthrax immune globulin, and pleural drainage led to full recovery; however, the role of passive immunization in anthrax treatment requires further evaluation.
