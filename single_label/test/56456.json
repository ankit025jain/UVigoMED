{"id":56456,"title":"Prevalence and aetiology of ocular hypertension in acute and chronic uveitis.","abstract":"To evaluate the prevalence and aetiology of intraocular hypertension (OHT) in granulomatous and non-granulomatous uveitisMedical records of 304 consecutive patients (484 eyes) with uveitis who visited the National Defense Medical Collage Hospital between April 2010 and March 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. OHT irrelevant to glaucomatous changes in optic disc or visual field was investigated.OHT was found in 123 eyes (25.4%) of 93 uveitic patients (30.6%); 92% of the eyes had open-angle OHT, 45.6% of which was steroid-induced. The prevalence of OHT was 100% (8/8) in Posner-Schlossman syndrome, 50.0% (10/20) in varicella zoster virus-associated iridocyclitis, 45% (9/20) in scleritis, 34.1% (15/44) in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, 32.1% (18/56) in Beh√ßet's disease (BD), 23.1% (6/26) in acute anterior uveitis, and 20.2% (19/94) in sarcoidosis. Pupillary block was observed only in non-granulomatous uveitis, but not in granulomatous uveitis. Seventy percent of OHT in granulomatous uveitis cases was inflammation-induced, while 76.7% in non-granulomatous uveitis cases was steroid-induced.OHT in non-granulomatous uveitis was mainly steroid-induced open-angle OHT with some cases of angle-closure OHT caused by pupillary block, while that in granulomatous uveitis was mostly inflammation-induced open-angle OHT with no pupillary block-related angle-closure OHT.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682184","annotations":[{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.866384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Scleritis","weight":0.702679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleritis"},{"name":"Chickenpox","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox"},{"name":"Herpes zoster","weight":0.579775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.573047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.553399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.444155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.414693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Varicella zoster virus","weight":0.342151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus"},{"name":"Iridocyclitis","weight":0.3268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridocyclitis"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.292857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Optic disc","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ocular hypertension","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_hypertension"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"1856","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1856"},{"name":"1544","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1544"},{"name":"1020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1020"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"920","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Bachelor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Collage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"}]}
