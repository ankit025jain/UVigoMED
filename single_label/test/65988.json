{"id":65988,"title":"[Observational study on urinary status following HoLEP].","abstract":"We assessed the safety, and postoperative urinary status of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Of the initial 117 patients who underwent HoLEP from November 2004 to March 2011, 49 were followed up for two yearsor longer. These 49 patients were evaluated once preoperatively, and at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, 48th, and 60th month postoperatively using International Prostate Symptom Scores (I-PSS) total and sub-score, quality of life score (QOL), maximum flow rate (Qmax), and post-voiding residual urine volume (PVR). The median estimated transition zone and enucleated volume were 45. 1 and 47. 9 g, respectively. Evaluation scores showed significant improvementsthroughout the follow-up. I-PSS total scoresimproved from 21 points(before surgery) to 6 points(12 monthsafter surgery), QOL scoresimproved from 5 pointsto 2 points, Qmax improved from 6.8 ml/s to 17.4 ml/s, and PVR improved from 101 ml to 26 ml, respectively. Transient urinary incontinence was noted in 14 patients (28.5%). One case showed a Clavien grade 3 complication of postoperative bleeding. No blood transfusion or re-surgery for BPH was required. In conclusion, HoLEP proved to be a safe and effective therapy, with potential to become a new gold standard for treating BPH.
