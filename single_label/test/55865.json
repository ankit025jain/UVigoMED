{"id":55865,"title":"[Clinical features of retinoblastoma in Tunisia].","abstract":"To report the relative frequency of presenting signs in Tunisian children with retinoblastoma and to evaluate their prognostic impact.A retrospective study was undertaken of 200 patients with retinoblastoma examined and treated between January 1993 and June 2009.There were 123 boys and 77 girls. For all cases, mean age at diagnosis was 29.8 months (range, 1 month to 9 years). There were 138 (69%) unilateral cases and 62 (31%) bilateral cases. Nineteen children (9.5%) had a family history of retinoblastoma. The most common signs were leukocoria (80%) and strabismus (28%) followed by proptosis. Orbital inflammation, hyphemia and phthisis are rare presenting findings in retinoblastoma. In our series, 26 children (13%) presented with extraocular retinoblastoma. Leukocoria and proptosis are significantly associated with a worse prognosis.The ability to recognize the presenting signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma can lead to earlier diagnosis and better prognosis.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792399","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.663374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.496564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.256263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.230556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Tunisia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia"},{"name":"Leukocoria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocoria"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Frequency (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Orbital (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(band)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
