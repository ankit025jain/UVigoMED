{"id":82845,"title":"Biochemical indicators of dental caries in saliva: an in vivo study.","abstract":"This study evaluated the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, copper and zinc levels in saliva of caries-active and caries-free individuals. Eighty healthy adults were divided according to WHO criteria: caries-free (DMFT = 0) and caries-active (DMFT >10). Saliva collected was estimated for SOD activity as well as copper and zinc levels using the atomic nitro blue tetrazolium chloride reduction method and absorption spectrophotometry, respectively. The Student t test was applied. In conclusion, SOD activity as well as copper and zinc levels increased in the caries-active group and showed statistically significant results.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504381","annotations":[{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.885975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.831158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.766122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.766076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.721843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.652371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Atom","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"},{"name":"Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitro_blue_tetrazolium_chloride"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Tetrazolium chloride","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrazolium_chloride"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Nitro compound","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitro_compound"}]}
