{"id":85239,"title":"Fibroblasts that resist cigarette smoke-induced senescence acquire profibrotic phenotypes.","abstract":"This study assessed the effect of extended exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on tissue repair functions in lung fibroblasts. Human fetal (HFL-1) and adult lung fibroblasts were exposed to CSE for 14 days. Senescence-associated ?-galactosidase (SA ?-gal) expression, cell proliferation, and tissue repair functions including chemotaxis and gel contraction were assessed. HFL-1 proliferation was inhibited by CSE and nearly half of the CSE-exposed cells were SA ?-gal positive after 14 days exposure, whereas 33% of adult lung fibroblasts were SA ?-gal positive in response to 10% CSE exposure. The SA ?-gal-positive cells did not proliferate as indicated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. In contrast, cells negative for SA ?-gal after CSE exposure proliferated faster than cells never exposed to CSE. These nonsenescent cells migrated more and contracted collagen gels more than control cells. CSE exposure stimulated TGF-?1 production, and both inhibition of TGF-? receptor kinase and TGF-?1 siRNA blocked CSE modulation of fibroblast function. Extended exposure to CSE might induce two different fibroblast phenotypes, a senescent and a profibrotic phenotype. The fibroblasts that resist CSE-induced cellular senescence may contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and could contribute to fibrotic lesions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acting through a TGF-?1-mediated pathway. In contrast, the senescent cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of emphysema.
