{"id":80838,"title":"Impacts of insecticide treated bed nets on Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations in Mbita district and Suba district, Western Kenya.","abstract":"Abundance and species composition of sympatric malaria vector species are the important factors governing transmission intensity. A widespread insecticidal bed net coverage may replace endophagic species with exophagic species. However, unique local environments also influence a vector population. This study examined the impacts of insecticidal bed nets on An. gambiae s.l populations in Mbita District and Suba District.The species compositions of An. gambiae s.l. larvae were compared between 1997, 2009 and 2010 and between geographical areas. The abundance and species composition of An. gambiae s.l. females resting indoors were compared between 1999, 2008 and 2010 and between geographical areas. Bed net coverage was also examined temporally and spatially, and its relationships with vector abundance and species composition were examined.The relative abundance of An. gambiae s.s. larvae was 31.4% in 1997, decreasing to 7.5% in 2008 and 0.3% in 2010. The density of indoor resting An. gambiae s.l. females decreased by nearly 95%, and the relative abundance of An. gambiae s.s. females decreased from 90.6% to 60.7% and 72.4% in 2008 and 2010, respectively. However, the species composition of indoor resting An. gambiae s.l. females changed little in the island villages, and An. gambiae s.s. remained dominant in the western part of the study area. The density of house resting females was negatively associated with the number of bed nets in a retrospective analysis, but the effect of bed nets on species composition was not significant in both retrospective and cross-sectional analyses.An increase in bed net coverage does not necessarily replace endophilic species with exophilic species. The effect of bed nets on An. gambiae s.l. populations varies spatially, and locally unique environments are likely to influence the species composition.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517160","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.912945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Insecticide","weight":0.749458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.635682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.541569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.251631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Mosquito net","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Suba District","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suba_District"},{"name":"Sympatry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatry"},{"name":"Anopheles gambiae","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles_gambiae"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Neighbourhood (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Species richness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_richness"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Oil reserves","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves"},{"name":"Mbita Point","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbita_Point"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Western Province (Kenya)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Province_(Kenya)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
