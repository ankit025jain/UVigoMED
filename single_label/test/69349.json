{"id":69349,"title":"Diffusion-weighted MRI of the testes in patients with varicocele: a preliminary study.","abstract":"This preliminary study aimed to evaluate changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the testes in patients presenting with varicocele.This cross-sectional study included 25 consecutively recruited patients with varicocele and 25 healthy control volunteers. The ADC values were measured in all participants. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to test the normality of the data distributions, and the data were expressed as arithmetic means and SDs. A one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Bonferroni test was used to analyze normally distributed continuous data. Independent sample Student t tests were used to compare continuous variables between two groups. Furthermore, a Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to examine the association of venous diameters with mean ADC values in patients with varicocele. A two-sided p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Sensitivities, specificities, and areas under the curve were calculated for the ADC values.The ADC values associated with the ipsilateral testicular parenchyma of patients with varicocele were found to be lower than those of healthy volunteers. Moreover, the ADC values of the contralateral testicular parenchyma in patients with varicocele were also lower than those of healthy volunteers. The sensitivity and specificity of ADC values were 90% and 96%, respectively, for patients with varicocele and 89.5% and 96% for healthy volunteers. The mean ADC values were significantly negatively correlated with venous diameter.The measurement of testicular ADC values may be used as a diagnostic indicator in the detection of testicular fibrosis.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450672","annotations":[{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation
