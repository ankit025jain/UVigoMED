{"id":91570,"title":"Glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve palsies associated with influenza vaccination.","abstract":"We herein report the first case of glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve palsies that appeared after an influenza vaccination. A 15-year-old boy developed dysphagia and dysarthria seven days after receiving an inoculation of the inactivated influenza vaccine. Massive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment was applied, as the patient's symptoms were considered to be immunological adverse effects of the influenza vaccine. He responded well to IVIg, and the symptoms immediately diminished. The mechanisms underlying the development of neurologic symptoms following vaccination are difficult to determine; however, providing immediate immunological treatment, such as IVIg, is effective and beneficial in countering these symptoms.
