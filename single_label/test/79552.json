{"id":79552,"title":"Medical and surgical management of a rare and complicated case of multivisceral hydatidosis; 18 years of evolution.","abstract":"Hydatidosis (echinococcosis) is a parasitic disease caused by the development in the human host of the larval form of the Echinococcus spp. tapeworm. Among the parasitic diseases transmitted from animal to human, hydatidosis represents the main Romanian helminthic zoonosis in humans, due to the severity of the clinical presentation and the complications of this illness. Before 1995-2000, surgical care was considered the only treatment available for the disease in Romania. Recently, the association of surgical procedures with pre and postoperative benzimidazolic drugs has been imposed. We describe the case of a patient diagnosed in 1995, when he had already presented a form of multivisceral hydatidosis, and we also emphasize the development of this disease in this transition period, which concerns the change in the hydatidosis approach.
