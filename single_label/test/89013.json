{"id":89013,"title":"Tactile surgical navigation system for complex acetabular fracture surgery.","abstract":"The authors describe a tactile surgical navigation system using custom 3-dimensional (3D) models of the bony pelvis for complex acetabular fracture surgery. The bone area of interest was extracted from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data of computed tomography scans. A standard triangulated language file was used to create 3D models of the bony pelvis by layered manufacturing using a 3D printer and non-cytotoxic, sterilizable, acrylic-based photopolymers. No infections and no toxic or other adverse events were observed. The models were useful for preoperative assessment, planning, and simulation; intraoperative assessment; obtaining informed consent; and education.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762831","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.64515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.371201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.348824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.302953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.297581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.239066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.197938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"DICOM","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM"},{"name":"3D printing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing"},{"name":"Printer (computing)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Global Positioning System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Digital imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_imaging"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Triangulation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation"},{"name":"Computer-assisted surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_surgery"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
