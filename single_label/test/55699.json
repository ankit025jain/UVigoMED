{"id":55699,"title":"Outcomes of descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty in patients with an anterior chamber versus posterior chamber intraocular lens.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the implications of a retained anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) during Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and to compare the outcomes in this group with those in patients who underwent DSAEK and had a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL).This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary medical center, which compares patients who underwent DSAEK and had a retained ACIOL with patients who underwent DSAEK and had a PCIOL regarding operative and postoperative complications, visual acuity, endothelial cell density, and long-term graft survival.Eleven eyes with an ACIOL and 50 eyes with a PCIOL met the study criteria. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of operative complications, change in visual acuity, graft survival, and endothelial cell loss.DSAEK in the setting of an ACIOL produced similar results to those of uncomplicated PCIOL cases. Although further studies are needed to gain more accurate information on this subject, it seems that DSAEK can be performed while retaining an ACIOL with favorable results.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831200","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.678215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.633472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.572425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.544263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.462611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.29601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.221289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Posterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.215403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.0989523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Striptease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striptease"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
