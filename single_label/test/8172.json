{"id":8172,"title":"The effect of lipocisplatin on cisplatin efficacy and nephrotoxicity in malignant breast cancer treatment.","abstract":"A lipid-cisplatin conjugate was synthesized for super-molecular assembly with lipids to form a new generation of liposomal cisplatin formulation, lipocisplatin. In vitro, lipocisplatin has higher efficacy in human ovarian cancer A2780 and human breast cancer MCF-7 with the murine breast cancer cell line 4T1 which is currently an established model for stage IV breast cancer as the most sensitive strain. Moreover, lipocisplatin demonstrated a greater MTD value and relatively longer blood circulation as compared to cisplatin. Lipocisplatin preferentially accumulate drugs to the tumor site, resulting in a better tumor inhibition efficacy. Moreover, lipocisplatin exceeds the size cutoff for kidney clearance, hence it bypasses the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin which is a major curse of one of the most efficient anticancer drugs nowadays in clinic. The results here indicated lipocisplatin may be translated into a new generation of liposomal based cisplatin drug in clinic.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797881","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.649835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.640631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.624962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.590954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.546244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.489645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.261876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.156906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Supramolecular chemistry","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supramolecular_chemistry"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Curse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
