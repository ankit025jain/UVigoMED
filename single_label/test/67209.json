{"id":67209,"title":"Improving bladder cancer imaging using 3-T functional dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to assess the capability of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2W-MRI) and the additional diagnostic value of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using multitransmit 3 T in the localization of bladder cancer.This prospective study was approved by the local institutional review board. Thirty-six patients were included in the study and provided informed consent. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed with T2W-MRI and DCE-MRI on a 3-T multitransmit system. Two observers (with 12 and 25 years of experience) independently interpreted T2W-MRI before DCE-MRI data (maps of pharmacokinetic parameters) to localize bladder tumors. The pathological examination of cystectomy bladder specimens was used as a reference criteria standard. The McNemar test was performed to evaluate the differences in sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Scores of ? were calculated to assess interobserver agreement.The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the localization with T2W-MRI alone were 81% (29/36), 63% (5/8), and 77% (34/44) for observer 1 and 72% (26/36), 63% (5/8), and 70% (31/44) for observer 2. With additional DCE-MRI available, these values were 92% (33/36), 75% (6/8), and 89% (39/44) for observer 1 and 92% (33/36), 63% (5/8), and 86% (38/44) for observer 2. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI significantly (P<0.01) improved the sensitivity and accuracy for observer 2. For the 23 patients treated with chemotherapy, DCE-MRI also significantly (P<0.02) improved the sensitivity and accuracy of bladder cancer localization with T2W-MRI alone for observer 2. Scores of ? were 0.63 for T2W-MRI alone and 0.78 for additional DCE-MRI. Of 7 subcentimeter malignant tumors, 4 (57%) were identified on T2W images and 6 (86%) were identified on DCE maps. Of 11 malignant tumors within the bladder wall thickening, 6 (55%) were found on T2W images and 10 (91%) were found on DCE maps.Compared with conventional T2W-MRI alone, the addition of DCE-MRI improved interobserver agreement as well as the localization of small malignant tumors and those within bladder wall thickening.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637583","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.911434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.899068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.676103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.532117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.526802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.480449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"3T","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3T"},{"name":"McNemar's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNemar's_test"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Dynamic (record label)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_(record_label)"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Thickening agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening_agent"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
