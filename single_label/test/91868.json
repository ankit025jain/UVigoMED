{"id":91868,"title":"The International Spinal Cord Injury Pain Basic Data Set (version 2.0).","abstract":"To revise the International Spinal Cord Injury Pain Basic Data Set (ISCIPBDS) based on new developments in the field and on suggestions from the spinal cord injury (SCI) and pain clinical and research community.International.The ISCIPBDS working group evaluated suggestions regarding the utility of the ISCIPBDS and made modifications in response to these and to significant developments in the field. The revised ISCIPBDS (version 2.0) was reviewed by members of the Executive Committee of the International SCI Standards and Data Sets, the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS) Executive and Scientific Committees, the American Spinal Injury Association and American Pain Society Boards and the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain, individual reviewers and societies and the ISCoS Council.The ISCIPBDS (version 2.0) is significantly shortened but still contains clinically relevant core questions concerning SCI-related pain. The revisions include an updated SCI pain classification, omission of three questions regarding temporal pain pattern and three pain interference questions. The remaining three pain interference questions concern perceived interference with activities, mood and sleep for overall pain rather than for individual pain problems and are scored on a 0 to 10 scale.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469147","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.359457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.159466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Scientific community","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.087394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"International Association for the Study of Pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_the_Study_of_Pain"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Chief executive officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"},{"name":"Set (mythology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mythology)"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Basic life support","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_life_support"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Omission (criminal law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_(criminal_law)"},{"name":"The International (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(film)"},{"name":"Working group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group"},{"name":"Special Interest Group","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Interest_Group"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"International Association for Professional Base Ball Players","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_Professional_Base_Ball_Players"}]}
