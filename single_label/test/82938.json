{"id":82938,"title":"Prevalence of dentine hypersensitivity in Chinese rural adults with dental fluorosis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of dentine hypersensitivity (DH) among residents of rural China with dental fluorosis aged 30-69 years. A village located in northern China in which dental fluorosis was common was selected. Some 1250 residents with fluorosis ranging in age from 30 to 69 years completed a structured questionnaire and underwent clinical examination. Diagnosis of DH was based on the combination of the subject's self-evaluation and clinical examination. Dental fluorosis was evaluated using Dean's index (DI). In the village, the fluoride concentration in drinking water was 1.15-1.50 mg L(-1) . The community fluorosis index was 1.47, and 74 (9.7%) of the participants with dental fluorosis were diagnosed with DH. There was no significant difference between men and women. DH was most commonly observed in the lower incisors, and the most common cause of DH was cold stimulation. Logistic regression analysis showed acid reflux to be the only risk factor for DH in the current study. Among subjects with DH, none took treatment measures, visited a hospital or clinic, or used antisensitivity toothpaste. The prevalence of DH in the selected subjects with dental fluorosis was 9.7%. Acid reflux was found to be a risk factor for DH in the current study.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484047","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.666115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.30075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.272756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Dental fluorosis","weight":0.266968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.264478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.228298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.215821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Dentine hypersensitivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
