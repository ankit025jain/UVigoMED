{"id":13620,"title":"Complete sequence and phylogenetic analysis of a porcine bocavirus strain swBoV CH437.","abstract":"Porcine bocavirus (PBoV), a member of genus Bocavirus, family Parvoviridae, was first identified in 2009 in Swedish swine herds suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. Up to date, the different species of PBoVs have been reported in different countries. Especially, the virus isolated in China was complicated. In this study, we detected a novel PBoV strain swBoV CH437 from clinical samples collected in Gansu Province, Northwest China. The complete genome of swBoV CH437 was 5,275 nucleotides (nt) in length and contains three ORFs: ORF1 encodes NS1 (2,004 nt, 667 aa), ORF3 encodes NP1 (681 nt, 226 aa), and ORF2 encodes VP1 (2,049 nt, 682 aa) and VP2 (1,641 nt, 546 aa). Sequence analysis demonstrated that the NS1 gene shared 24.2-88.6 % nucleotide sequence identity, the NP1 shared 21.3-89.9 %, less than 95 % nucleotide sequence identity with other PBoV strains. Therefore, we propose that swBoV CH437 should be classified as a novel PBoV species.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469465","annotations":[{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.818757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.804907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.754166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.743205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.620715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.594264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.575714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.563352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.504288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.482171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Gansu","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Cachexia","weight":0.250302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.219056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"NS1 Influenza Protein","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS1_Influenza_Protein"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Parvoviridae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvoviridae"},{"name":"Northwest China","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_China"},{"name":"ORF (broadcaster)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORF_(broadcaster)"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"}]}
