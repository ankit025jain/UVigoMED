{"id":58957,"title":"The effects of prenatal exposure to low-level cadmium, lead and selenium on birth outcomes.","abstract":"To evaluate the current maternal and fetal exposure to cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and selenium (Se), and their potential effect on newborn birth outcomes, a cross-sectional study involving an assessment of the levels of these three metals in maternal blood, urine and umbilical cord blood was conducted in 209 pregnant women living in Eastern China. The maternal blood, urine and cord blood samples were collected and measured with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The maternal blood concentrations of Cd, Pb and Se (the geometric means (GMs) were 0.48, 39.50 and 143.53 ?g L(-1)) were significantly higher than and correlated with those in the cord blood (GM: 0.09, 31.62 and 124.61 ?g L(-1)). In the urine samples, the GMs for Cd, Pb and Se were 0.13, 0.48, and 4.78 ?g L(-1), respectively. Passive smoking was found to positively correlate with urine Cd (r=0.16) and negatively correlate with urine Se (r=-0.29). The maternal blood Se level was negatively associated with the cord Cd levels (r=-0.41). The blood Cd concentration in the mother could significantly affect the newborn birth weight (r=-0.22), but it was not correlated with birth height. We identified cord Se as a new factor which significantly correlated with birth weight. In conclusion, maternal Cd, Pb, Se exposure correlated with their umbilical cord concentration, and maternal Cd exposure might affect the newborn birth weight. Increasing the Se intake might reduce the cord blood Cd concentration and promote the fetal growth.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875909","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.810373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.799083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.790478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.699009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Cadmium","weight":0.66809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.403792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.347706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.300698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.297409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Passive smoking","weight":0.278888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Inductive coupling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_coupling"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Electromagnetic induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Smoking and pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_and_pregnancy"}]}
