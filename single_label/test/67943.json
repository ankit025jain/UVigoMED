{"id":67943,"title":"Detection of tumor-associated antigens in culture supernatants using autoantibodies in sera from patients with bladder cancer.","abstract":"Secreted proteins play essential roles in the process of tumorigenesis, and the analysis of tumor-secreted proteins has been suggested as a promising strategy for identifying cancer biomarkers. In this study, we performed proteomic analysis to identify proteins secreted from bladder cancer cell lines that are recognized by autoantibodies in sera from patients with bladder cancer. In addition,autoantibodies against the identified proteins were validated using a dot-blot array with sera from patients with bladder cancer and normal controls. As the results, we detected twenty-five and thirty-two immunoreactive spots in sera from patients with high- and low-grade bladder cancer, respectively.In addition, validation analysis revealed that serum IgG levels of anti-calreticulin and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) autoantibodies were significantly higher in bladder cancer patients than in normal controls (both P < 0.05). Furthermore, the serum IgG level of anti-MMP2 autoantibody was significantly higher in patients with high- compared to low-grade bladder cancer(P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, the serum IgG level of anti-MMP2 autoantibody was an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival (P < 0.05). Based on these findings, serum IgG levels of anti-calreticulin and MMP2 autoantibodies may be novel biomarker candidates for bladder cancer and its clinical outcome.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573199","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.675683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.452697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.375957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.262548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0381353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
