{"id":80978,"title":"[Surveillance of echinococcosis in Liyang City from 2008 to 2012].","abstract":"To investigate the Echinococcus infection of people and domestic animals in Liyang City, so as to provide the evidence for the establishment of control measures of echinococcosis.The formerly confirmed cases and clue cases were investigated. The Echinococcus antibody in serum of children aged from 7 to 12 years old and adults in key towns and control towns was detected with ELISA, and the antigen in fecal samples of dogs in key towns was also detected. B ultrasound was applied to examine the ELISA positive cases, family member and the neighbored people around them. The sheep in the market were dissected and examined for Echinococcus.The Echinococcus antibody positive rates were 0.93% and 0.52% in children and adults, respectively. The Echinococcus antigen positive rate was 0.95% in dogs. There were no significant difference between the positive rates of the children and adults (CHI2 = 2.124, P > 0.05). No cases were found by ultrasonic examination and no Echinococcus infection was found in the sheep.The people with Echinococcus antibody in serum and dogs with antigen in their feces are found in the surveillance of echinococcosis, therefore, there exists the complete chain of transmission in local. Thus, in the prevention and control work for the disease, the monitoring of dog feces, quarantine of sheep from other regions, as well as the population health education in key areas should be strengthened.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490370","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.901493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"List of domesticated animals","weight":0.638065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_domesticated_animals"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.636555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.622752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Quarantine","weight":0.582786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.534903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.367051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.337394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0293009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population health","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_health"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Total order","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Liyang","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liyang"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"}]}
