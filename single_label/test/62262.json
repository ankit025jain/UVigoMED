{"id":62262,"title":"[Prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients. Clinical value of low-molecular-weight heparins].","abstract":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer. Because of their improved subcutaneous bioavailability and reliable antithrombotic efficiency low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are preferably used for prevention and treatment of cancer-related VTE. Thromboprophylaxis with LMWH is well established in patients undergoing cancer surgery and hospitalized cancer patients, while outpatient prophylaxis remains contentious. LMWH are recommended over unfractionated heparins and vitamin K antagonists for initial treatment and secondary prophylaxis (3-6 months) after cancer-related VTE. Long-term secondary prophylaxis should be considered for patients with ongoing active malignancy and low bleeding risk. Due to absence of clinical studies in cancer patients, the use of novel oral anticoagulants is currently not recommended.
