{"id":37859,"title":"Delivery room surgery: an applicable therapeutic strategy for gastroschisis in developing countries.","abstract":"The survival rate of infants with gastroschisis has improved significantly. It is over 90% in developed countries, but 50% in developing countries. This study aimed to investigate the factors improving the survival rate of infants with gastroschisis in developing countries.Neonates meeting the inclusion criteria, who presented to our center since the establishment of delivery room surgery, were enrolled into this retrospective study. Data were evaluated specifically to determine the role of delivery room surgery in reducing the mortality and morbidity of infants with gastroschisis and to identify factors optimizing the conditions of outborn infants.A total of 64 infants were identified. The overall survival rate of the infants was 60.9%. The survival rate of infants in inborns was 76.5%, and the survival rate of infants in outborns was 43.3%. Infants of the outborn group took more time to reach full enteral feeding, and were more likely to require a prolonged stay in hospital when compared with those of the inborn group. Logistic analysis identified that the surgical technique, the presence of sepsis and intestinal necrosis could be expected to influence the outcome of gastroschisis.The strategy of delivery of patients in a center prepared to perform delivery room closure of gastroschisis appears to improve the survival of patients with gastroschisis. Further reduction in mortality rates will depend on improved conditions of outborn infants.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464667","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.832728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.764874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.748144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.724895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Gastroschisis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroschisis"},{"name":"Enteral","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteral"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Match fixing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Military logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_logistics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
