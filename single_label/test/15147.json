{"id":15147,"title":"[Hand hygiene--part of patient safety from Semmelweis to the present].","abstract":"Hand disinfection is one of the most important part of patient safety. By adequate hand disinfection healthcare workers can prevent about 40 per cent of healthcare-associated infections and about 50 per cent of patients' MRSA contaminations in hospitals. Adherence to hand disinfection has been observed in an average of 40 per cent of patient contacts. One of the risk factors leading to poor adherence is the \"doctor\" status of a healthcare worker. Introduction of an alcohol-based hand rub close to the patient is one of the most significant factors for improved hand hygiene.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272786","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hand washing","weight":0.389986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing"},{"name":"Ignaz Semmelweis","weight":0.341027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"}]}
