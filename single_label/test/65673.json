{"id":65673,"title":"Statin and the risk of renal-related serious adverse events: Analysis from the IDEAL, TNT, CARDS, ASPEN, SPARCL, and other placebo-controlled trials.","abstract":"A recent study has shown an association between high-potency statins and risk of acute kidney injury. However, these data are from observational studies, and it is not clear if similar signal is seen from randomized controlled trials. We evaluated the risk of renal-associated serious adverse events (SAEs) using statins versus placebo trials and the high-dose versus low-dose statin trials that were available to us. The outcome of interest was renal-related SAEs. The incidence of adverse events relating to kidney injury was determined through review of the adverse event database. The following outcomes were evaluated: (1) renal-related SAEs within 120 days of randomization (primary outcome), (2) renal-related SAEs after 120 days of randomization (secondary), and (3) drug discontinuation due to renal-related SAEs (secondary). There was no difference in the incidence of renal-related SAEs at 120 days (0.04% vs 0.10%, p = 0.162) between atorvastatin and placebo in the 24 placebo-controlled trials (10,345 patients on atorvastatin (10 to 80 mg/day) versus 8,945 patients on placebo) or in the high-dose versus low-dose statin trials including the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) study (0.05% vs 0.02%, p = 0.625) or the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial (0.0% vs 0.04%, p = 0.500) trial. Results were similar for renal-related SAEs after 120 days (placebo controlled trials [0.38% vs 0.36%, p = 0.905], IDEAL trial [0.56% vs 0.65%, p = 0.683], or the TNT trial [0.76% vs 1.04%, p = 0.168]) and for drug withdrawal due to renal-related SAE (placebo controlled trials [0.05% vs 0.04%, p = 1.00], IDEAL trial [0.02% vs 0.0%, p = 0.499], or the TNT trial [0.08% vs 0.12%, p = 0.754]). In conclusion, the results from clinical trials with data from 149,882 patient-years of follow-up fail to show any increase in renal-related SAEs with statins compared with controls.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793673","annotations":[{"name":"Statin","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.707105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.679408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.631563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.447581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.445831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Atorvastatin","weight":0.424008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.344152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.333333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"754","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/754"},{"name":"683","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/683"},{"name":"345","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/345"},{"name":"882","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/882"},{"name":"945","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/945"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Targets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targets"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Point (ice hockey)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"IDEAL","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEAL"},{"name":"Increment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment"},{"name":"SAE International","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_International"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Decrease (knitting)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decrease_(knitting)"},{"name":"Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development, and Stabilisation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Assistance_for_Reconstruction,_Development,_and_Stabilisation"}]}
