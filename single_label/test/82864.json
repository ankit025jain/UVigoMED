{"id":82864,"title":"Multiple logistic regression analysis of risk factors associated with denture plaque and staining in Chinese removable denture wearers over 40 years old in Xi'an--a cross-sectional study.","abstract":"Removable dentures are subject to plaque and/or staining problems. Denture hygiene habits and risk factors differ among countries and regions. The aims of this study were to assess hygiene habits and denture plaque and staining risk factors in Chinese removable denture wearers aged >40 years in Xi'an through multiple logistic regression analysis (MLRA).Questionnaires were administered to 222 patients whose removable dentures were examined clinically to assess wear status and levels of plaque and staining. Univariate analyses were performed to identify potential risk factors for denture plaque/staining. MLRA was performed to identify significant risk factors.Brushing (77.93%) was the most prevalent cleaning method in the present study. Only 16.4% of patients regularly used commercial cleansers. Most (81.08%) patients removed their dentures overnight. MLRA indicated that potential risk factors for denture plaque were the duration of denture use (reference, ?0.5 years; 2.1-5 years: OR?=?4.155, P?=?0.001; >5 years: OR?=?7.238, P<0.001) and cleaning method (reference, chemical cleanser; running water: OR?=?7.081, P?=?0.010; brushing: OR?=?3.567, P?=?0.005). Potential risk factors for denture staining were female gender (OR?=?0.377, P?=?0.013), smoking (OR?=?5.471, P?=?0.031), tea consumption (OR?=?3.957, P?=?0.002), denture scratching (OR?=?4.557, P?=?0.036), duration of denture use (reference, ?0.5 years; 2.1-5 years: OR?=?7.899, P?=?0.001; >5 years: OR?=?27.226, P<0.001), and cleaning method (reference, chemical cleanser; running water: OR?=?29.184, P<0.001; brushing: OR?=?4.236, P?=?0.007).Denture hygiene habits need further improvement. An understanding of the risk factors for denture plaque and staining may provide the basis for preventive efforts.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498369","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.412282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.320845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.216595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Tea","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.13094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Xi'an","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi'an"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"899","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/899"},{"name":"557","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/557"},{"name":"238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238"},{"name":"957","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/957"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Scratching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratching"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cleanser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanser"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Tap water","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_water"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
