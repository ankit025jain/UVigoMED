{"id":85802,"title":"Advances in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","abstract":"Clinical trial data continue to emerge on treatments in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), supporting the strategy that histology and molecular driver mutations should guide treatment selection. During her presentation at the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. Leora Horn highlighted 3 specific areas in which the 2014 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for NSCLC focus attention: updates on the assortment of chemotherapy options, targeted therapies and how acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors appears to have become the catalyst of the development of newer-generations of agents, and the revisited role of newer immunotherapeutic options.
