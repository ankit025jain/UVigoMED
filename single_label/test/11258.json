{"id":11258,"title":"Use of the Konnyaku Shirataki noodle as a low fidelity simulation training model for microvascular surgery in the operating theatre.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a type of Japanese noodle, named \"shirataki konnyaku\", for microsurgery training in the operating room. Thirteen surgical residents without experience in microsurgery had to perform two microsurgical anastomoses: one on a model of a femoral artery of a rat (control) and one on a model of a konnyaku shirataki. Two quantitative variables (time in minutes and number of stitches to perform the anastomosis) and two qualitative variables (patency and tightness of the anastomosis) were measured. Sixty anastomoses were performed with the control model and 62 anastomoses with the konnyaku model. The time of the anatomosis was significantly higher in the control group. The number of stitches was similar in both groups. The patency of the anastomosis was significantly lower in the control group. The tightness (no leak) of the anastomosis was significantly higher in the control group. The \"konnyaku shirataki\" model could improve the teaching of microsurgery due to its availability, low cost and structural similarity to the animal model.
