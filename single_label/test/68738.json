{"id":68738,"title":"Acute kidney injury after primary angioplasty: effect of different hydration treatments.","abstract":"We evaluated the effect of different dose hydration protocols, with normal saline or bicarbonate, on the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).We considered 592 STEMI patients treated with PPCI in 5 Italian centers. Patients were randomized to receive standard or high-dose infusions of normal saline or sodium bicarbonate started immediately before contrast medium administration and continued for the following 12?h.The cumulative incidence of CI-AKI was 18.1% without any difference among treatment groups. Shock, age, ejection fraction 35% or less, and basal serum creatinine were significantly associated with an increased risk of CI-AKI. Follow-up at 12 months was complete in 573 patients. Overall, 25 out of 573 patients died (4.3%). We observed higher short-term mortality rates in patients receiving high-volume hydration. Otherwise, only age, shock and CI-AKI were significantly associated with 1-year mortality.In patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI, high-volume hydration with normal saline or sodium bicarbonate administrated at the time of contrast media administration was not associated with any significant advantage in terms of CI-AKI prevention.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24500238","annotations":[{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.88253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Sodium bicarbonate","weight":0.86916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.746694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.649638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.610337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.57859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.572514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.33572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.320833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Bicarbonate","weight":0.318454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.310706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dehydration","weight":0.221841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mediumship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
