{"id":83502,"title":"Phytodermatitis to Euphorbia trigona.","abstract":"A 56-year-old Caucasian woman presented with acute onset of dermatitis on her face accompanied by intense itching. The patient reported that the condition began after cleaning a decorative plant, Euphorbia trigona, and contact with some drops of the plant's latex sap released upon cutting its leaves. The clinical examination revealed erythema and edema of the infraorbital and perioral regions (Figure 1). The patient was in otherwise good general health, had no personal or family history of systemic or skin disease, and was not receiving any concomitant medications. Therapy with topical methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% cream once daily was initiated and systemic desloratadine 5 mg tablets once daily was administered for the intense itch. Seven days after the introduction of the treatment a significant improvement was noticed (Figure 2). Patch testing with the leaves of the plant as well as with the latex sap was undertaken in order to prove the causative role (Figures 3 and 4). Strongly positive reactions with bulla formation were observed on day 2 and 3, most likely suggesting acute irritation instead of true delayed hypersensitivity.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335357","annotations":[{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Blister","weight":0.754906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.723636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.457433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.413647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.298387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.295781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.233652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Plant sap","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_sap"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Type IV hypersensitivity","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_IV_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"Beauty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Euphorbia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
