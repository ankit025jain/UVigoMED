{"id":91083,"title":"Isolated abdominal trauma: diagnosis and clinical management considerations.","abstract":"The scope of the present study is to review the topics of initial assessment, diagnosis and clinical management of an isolated abdominal trauma.Progress in the management of trauma patients increasing survival includes a multidisciplinary approach involving multiple specialties at presentation. If immediate surgical intervention is needed, 'damage control' is the best option; if not, it has been proven that conservative management is superior to operative, in terms of survival for the majority of intraabdominal injury. 'Open abdomen' should be performed in major abdominal traumas when indicated. Early enteral feeding is beneficial, even in the presence of 'open abdomen'.Abdominal trauma is a complex injury; the multidisciplinary approach has made nonoperative management feasible and effective. When surgical intervention is needed, it should be performed in an orderly fashion, within the context of the overall management.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553338","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.263605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Progress (spacecraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_(spacecraft)"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Orderly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orderly"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary approach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_approach"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Damage control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_control"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
