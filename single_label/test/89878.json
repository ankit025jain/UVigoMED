{"id":89878,"title":"[Intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus : aspects of fracture treatment in geriatric patients].","abstract":"In the context of osteoporotic fractures, injuries to the distal humerus are quite uncommon, meaning that each surgeon will have only limited experience.This leads automatically to the question to what extent treatment recommendations can be transferred to the geriatric population.Looking at the evidence-based literature, recommendations could be limited to three prospective studies. However, this only means that the remaining literature sources do not provide sufficient statistical power to be able to draw conclusions.For the population of geriatric patients a thorough compilation of the contemporary literature is advisable. This review article on the currently available literature evaluates and individually discusses the relevant aspects of fracture treatment in order to develop recommendations for routine daily practice.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671347","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.518456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.472547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.464478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.224057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.1201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical power","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Professional wrestling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"},{"name":"Contemporary literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_literature"},{"name":"Review article","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_article"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Compilation album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_album"}]}
