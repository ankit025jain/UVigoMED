{"id":25896,"title":"[Brief overview of the guidelines for the use of 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)].","abstract":"The guidelines for the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring published from Japanese Circulation Society in 2010 was briefly overviewed. The accuracy of devices now used in clinical practice in Japan is of sufficient grade. The thresholds for hypertension diagnosis based on ABPM have been determined with international concensus. The evaluation of ABPM data and the clinical indications for ABPM are suggested. Particularly, white-coat hypertension, masked hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, morning hypertension and diurnal blood pressure variation are conditions for which ABPM is very useful for the detection, treatment decision and follow-up. Hypertension treatment would be very much improved by the introduction of ABPM into clinical practice.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167736","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.548697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.416493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diurnality","weight":0.355612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.342407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.33786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.280998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0763854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Whitecoat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitecoat"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
