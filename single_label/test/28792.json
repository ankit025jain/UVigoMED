{"id":28792,"title":"Prize contingency management for smoking cessation: a randomized trial.","abstract":"Adjunctive behavioral smoking cessation treatments have the potential to improve outcomes beyond standard care. The present study had two aims: (1) compare standard care (SC) for smoking (four weeks of brief counseling and monitoring) to SC plus prize-based contingency management (CM), involving the chance to earn prizes on days with demonstrated smoking abstinence (carbon monoxide (CO) ?6 ppm); and (2) compare the relative efficacy of two prize reinforcement schedules-one a traditional CM schedule, and the second an early enhanced CM schedule providing greater reinforcement magnitude in the initial week of treatment but equal overall reinforcement.Participants (N=81 nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers) were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions.Prize CM resulted in significant reductions in cigarette smoking relative to SC. These reductions were not apparent at follow-up. We found no meaningful differences between the traditional and enhanced CM conditions.Our findings reveal that prize CM leads to significant reductions in smoking during treatment relative to a control intervention, but the benefits did not extend long-term.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793364","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.733959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.665384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.606572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Contingency management","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_management"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"N81 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N81_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"South Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Prize","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Contingency (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
