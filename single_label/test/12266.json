{"id":12266,"title":"Naringenin inhibits allergen?induced airway remodeling in a murine model of asthma.","abstract":"The flavonoid naringenin has been shown to attenuate airway inflammation and airway hyper?reactivity in acute murine models of asthma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of naringenin in allergen?induced airway remodeling in mice. Ovalbumin (OVA)?sensitized mice were challenged with OVA for 8 weeks to produce a model of chronic asthma. Airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), inflammation and remodeling were evaluated in mice receiving naringenin prior to OVA challenge. Compared to OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice, those treated with naringenin showed markedly attenuated chronic inflammation, persistent AHR and airway remodeling. In addition, naringenin treatment caused a significant reduction in the levels of total serum IgE and of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Naringenin may thus delay the progression of airway remodeling, providing a potential treatment for asthma.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534822","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.725634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.697123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.580598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.573145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.529215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.409085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.273852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.208774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Original video animation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_video_animation"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"Naringenin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naringenin"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"},{"name":"Recurrent airway obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
