{"id":74328,"title":"Serum amyloid A, fetuin-A, and pentraxin-3 levels in patients with ischemic stroke: novel prognostic biomarkers?","abstract":"Inflammation plays an important role in acute ischemic stroke. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between acute ischemic stroke and serum amyloid A, fetuin-A, and pentraxin-3 which are inflammation markers.We enrolled 52 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 30 sex-matched control subjects in the study. The patients were followed for 3 months. We evaluated the common risk factors, laboratory variables, and neurological examination of stroke patients according to prognosis scales.The median serum amyloid A, fetuin-A, and pentraxin-3 levels in the stroke patients were higher than in control subjects (respectively, P = 0.000, P = 0.002, and P = 0.037). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores, glucose, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and white blood cell count showed differences within the group in terms of the serum amyloid A tertiles statistically.Pentraxin-3, fetuin-A, and serum amyloid A all arise together as novel prognostic factors in a group of patients with ischemic stroke. Relationships between higher levels of inflammation markers, especially serum amyloid A, and the severity of acute ischemic stroke were shown.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558553","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.678215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.643117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Neurological examination","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_examination"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.343345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.325646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.149922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"White blood cell count","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell_count"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Serum amyloid A","weight":0.0294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_amyloid_A"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
