{"id":62648,"title":"Curcusone D, a novel ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inhibitor via ROS-induced DUB inhibition, is synergistic with bortezomib against multiple myeloma cell growth.","abstract":"Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) plays a very important role in the degradation of proteins. Finding novel UPP inhibitors is a promising strategy for treating multiple myeloma (MM).Ub-YFP reporter assays were used as cellular UPP models. MM cell growth, apoptosis and overall death were evaluated with the MTS assay, Annexin V/PI dual-staining flow cytometry, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and PI uptake, respectively. The mechanism of UPP inhibition was analyzed by western blotting for ubiquitin, in vitro and cellular proteasomal and deubiquitinases (DUBs) activity assays. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured with H2DCFDA.Curcusone D, identified as a novel UPP inhibitor, causes cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in MM cells. Curcusone D induced the accumulation of poly-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins but could not inhibit proteasomal activity in vitro or in cells. Interestingly, the mono-ubiquitin level and the total cellular DUB activity were significantly downregulated following curcusone D treatment. Furthermore, curcusone D could induce ROS, which were closely correlated with DUB inhibition that could be nearly completely reversed by NAC. Finally, curcusone D and the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib showed a strong synergistic effect against MM cells.Curcusone D is novel UPP inhibitor that acts via the ROS-induced inhibition of DUBs to produce strong growth inhibition and apoptosis of MM cells and synergize with bortezomib.The anti-MM molecular mechanism study of curcusone D will promote combination therapies with different UPP inhibitors against MM and further support the concept of oxidative stress regulating the activity of DUBs.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
