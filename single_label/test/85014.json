{"id":85014,"title":"Characteristics of dental fear among Arabic-speaking children: a descriptive study.","abstract":"Dental fear has not only been linked to poor dental health in children but also persists across the lifespan, if unaddressed, and can continue to affect oral, systemic, and psychological health. The aim of this study was to assess the factor structure of the Arabic version of the Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS), and to assess the difference in factor structure between boys and girls.Participants were 220 consecutive paediatric dental patients 6-12 years old seeking dental care at the Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. Participants completed the 15-item Arabic version of the CFSS-DS questionnaire at the end of the visit. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Factor analysis (principal components, varimax rotation) was employed to assess the factor structure of the scale.The Cronbach's alpha was 0.86. Four factors with eigenvalues above 1.00 were identified, which collectively explained 64.45% of the variance. These factors were as follows: Factor 1, 'fear of usual dental procedures' consisted of 8 items such as 'drilling' and 'having to open the mouth', Factor 2, 'fear of health care personnel and injections' consisted of three items, Factor 3, 'fear of strangers', consisted of 2 items. Factor 4, 'fear of general medical aspects of treatment', consisted of 2 items. Notably, four factors of dental fear were found in girls, while five were found in boys.Four factors of different strength pertaining to dental fear were identified in Arabic-speaking children, indicating a simple structure. Most items loaded high on the factor related to fear of usual dental procedures. The fear-provoking aspects of dental procedures differed in boys and girls. Use of the scale may enable dentists to determine the item/s of dental treatment that a given child finds most fear-provoking and guide the child's behaviour accordingly.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25245109","annotations":[{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.900826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Arabic language","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.697567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Dental fear","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fear"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.37262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.253121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","weight":0.243561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.140999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud_of_Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health Human Resources","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Human_Resources"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"King Abdulaziz University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdulaziz_University"},{"name":"Monarch","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Alexandria University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_University"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Systems theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory"}]}
