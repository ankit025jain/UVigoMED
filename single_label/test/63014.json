{"id":63014,"title":"Assessment of posture and joint movements of the upper limbs of patients after mastectomy and lymphadenectomy.","abstract":"To evaluate alterations in posture and range of motion of the upper limbs in women after mastectomy and lymphadenectomy, submitted to radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment.Two groups were evaluated: 16 post-mastectomy women with lymphedema of the upper limb and 14 post-mastectomy women without lymphedema. Patients were submitted to analysis made by software, one for posture and the other to measure ranges of movement of the shoulder, elbow, and wrists. The results obtained were compared between the right and left sides, and operated and non-operated sides, and then were submitted to statistical tests.Both groups presented with anteriorization of the trunk. The women with lymphedema had head rotation to the right, protrusion of the left shoulder, and trunk inclination angle smaller on the operated side, besides bilateral elevation of the scapula when compared to the group with no lymphedema. Changes in range of motion were also smaller on the operated side in terms of flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the shoulder for all women, and for those with lymphedema, elbow extension and wrist flexion had a smaller range of motion.Women submitted to mastectomy presented with asymmetries and modifications in posture, and lymphedema seemed to worsen this condition. Additionally, they had deficits in range of motion in the shoulders on the operated side. Women with lymphedema also showed deficits in the elbows and wrist.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488379","annotations":[{"name":"Scapula","weight":0.88388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.706273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.642963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.369223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.280205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.273369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.218911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.202022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Shoulders","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulders"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"}]}
