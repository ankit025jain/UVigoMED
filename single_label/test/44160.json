{"id":44160,"title":"[Comparison of epidural and opioid analgesia effects on frequency of paralytic ileus development in patients of surgical intensive care unit].","abstract":"The impact of epidural analgesia (EA) on bowel peristalsis in Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) patients is not well known. This study was designed to determine if EA improves bowel motility and decreases the incidence of postoperative paralytic ileus compared to patients receiving systemic opioid analgesia (OA). Through prospective cohort study we investigated 386 SICU patients who received EA [n = 70 (18.13%)], or OA +/- ketorolac trometamol [n = 316 (81.87%)]. We showed that EA does not improve time to defecation and does not decrease the incidence of paralytic ileus in SICU patients.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749260","annotations":[{"name":"Peristalsis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Ketorolac","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.662814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.618468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.603608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.362845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.325755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ileus","weight":0.236252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileus"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Tris","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tris"},{"name":"Electronic Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
