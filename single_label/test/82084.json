{"id":82084,"title":"Prevalence of sleep bruxism and associated factors in preschool children.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sleep bruxism and associated factors in three- to five-year-olds.A representative cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 749 preschool children during immunization campaigns. Data acquisition involved an oral clinical exam, anthropometric measures, and a questionnaire administered in interview form. All data were analyzed using the chi-square test and Poisson regression with robust variance with the aid of SPSS software.The prevalence of sleep bruxism among preschool children was approximately 14 percent. Statistically significant associations were found: between sleep bruxism and lower dental crowding (prevalence ratio=3.38; 95% confidence interval=1.9-5.7); for the habit of biting on objects (PR=2.49; 95% CI=1.4-4.4); for duration of breast-feeding for a period longer than 12 months (PR=1.98; 95% CI=1.2-3.2); and for bottle-feeding for more than 24 months (PR=1.93; 95% CI=1.2-3.1).Lower arch crowding, the habit of biting on objects, and prolonged breast-feeding and bottle-feeding were associated with sleep bruxism in the preschool children analyzed in the present study.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717709","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.632087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.271578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Data acquisition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"749","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/749"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"}]}
