{"id":88941,"title":"Evidence-based medicine: Flexor tendon repair.","abstract":"After studying this article, the participant should be able to: (1) Describe and apply the current evidence-based treatment of acute flexor tendon injuries. (2) Compare and contrast the current postoperative therapy regimens following repair of flexor tendons. (3) Apply an evidence-based decision-making process for suture techniques of flexor tendon injuries.Flexor tendon repair remains a challenge for hand surgeons to reliably obtain excellent results. Surgical decisions should rely on the surgeon's experience, outcome studies, and direct evidence. This review is a compilation of the evidence from the literature on optimizing outcomes for flexor tendon repair.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776553","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.801156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.567308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.3941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Annular ligaments of fingers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_ligaments_of_fingers"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Compilation album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_album"},{"name":"Direct evidence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_evidence"}]}
