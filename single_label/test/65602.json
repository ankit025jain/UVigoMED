{"id":65602,"title":"Real-time transrectal ultrasonography-guided hands-free technique for focal cryoablation of the prostate.","abstract":"To describe, step-by-step, our hands-free technique for focal cryoablation of prostate cancer.After detailed discussion of its limitations and benefits, consent was obtained to perform focal cryoablation in patients with biopsy-proven unilateral low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The procedure was performed transperineally, using a hands-free technique (without an external grid template) under real-time bi-plane transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guidance, using an argon/helium-gas-based third generation cryoablation system. Follow-up consisted of validated questionnaires, physical examination, PSA measures, multiparametric TRUS and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mandatory biopsy.The important steps for achieving safety, satisfactory oncological and functional outcomes included: patient selection, including TRUS/MRI fusion target biopsy; thermocouple and cryoprobe placement with a hands-free technique, allowing delivery in unrestricted angulations according to the prostatic contour, the course of the neurovascular bundle and the rectal wall angle; and hands-free bi-plane TRUS probe manipulation to facilitate real-time monitoring of anatomical landmarks at the ideal angle of the image plane. To achieve a lethal temperature in the known cancer area, while preserving the urinary sphincter, neurovascular bundle, urethra and rectal wall, continuous intraoperative control of the thermocouple temperatures was necessary, as were real-time TRUS monitoring of ice-ball size, control of the energy delivered and the use of a warming urethral catheter.We have described step-by-step the focal cryoablation of prostate cancer using a hands-free technique. This technique facilitates the effective delivery of cryoprobes and the intra-operative real-time quick manipulation of the TRUS probe.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802231","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.88948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.784822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.723647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cryosurgery","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosurgery"},{"name":"Transrectal ultrasonography","weight":0.614782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrectal_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.351715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.131728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Thermocouple","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Biplane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biplane"},{"name":"Cryoablation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoablation"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
