{"id":89594,"title":"[Our experience with orthopedic damage control in high-energy tibial pylon fractures].","abstract":"High-energy tibial pylon fractures represent some of the most severe injuries of the ankle joint and currently represent a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon. These are usually polytraumatized patients and before admitting them into the traumatology unit, spinal cord, pelvic or thoracoabdominal injuries should be ruled out. Due to the special anatomy of the area, its thin skin cover and subcutaneous location, soft tissues are usually severely affected and this is key when choosing the time for a surgical intervention. Although the definitive treatment of these injuries is controversial, the so called two-stage treatment seems to predominate in order to minimize soft tissue iatrogenic injuries applying the concept of orthopedic damage control of the limb. We present the preliminary results of 10 patients operated with this method at our center.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701756","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.761694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Traumatology","weight":0.741097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatology"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Center (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
