{"id":13370,"title":"Neuroprotection of posttreatment with risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, in rat and gerbil models of ischemic stroke and the maintenance of antioxidants in a gerbil model of ischemic stroke.","abstract":"Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has been discovered to have some beneficial effects beyond its original effectiveness. The present study examines the neuroprotective effects of risperidone against ischemic damage in the rat and gerbil induced by transient focal and global cerebral ischemia, respectively. The results showed that pre- and posttreatment with 4 mg/kg risperidone significantly protected against neuronal death from ischemic injury. Many NeuN-immunoreactive neurons and a few F-J B-positive cells were found in the rat cerebral cortex and gerbil hippocampal CA1 region (CA1) in the risperidone-treated ischemia groups compared with those in the vehicle-treated ischemia group. In addition, treatment with risperidone markedly attenuated the activation of microglia in the gerbil CA1. On the other hand, we found that treatment with risperidone significantly maintained the antioxidants levels in the ischemic gerbil CA1. Immunoreactivities of superoxide dismutases 1 and 2, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were maintained in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1; the antioxidants were very different from those in the vehicle-treated ischemia groups. In brief, our present findings indicate that posttreatment as well as pretreatment with risperidone can protect neurons in the rat cerebral cortex and gerbils CA1 from transient cerebral ischemic injury and that the neuroprotective effect of risperidone may be related to attenuation of microglial activation as well as maintenance of antioxidants.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481585","annotations":[{"name":"Atypical antipsychotic","weight":0.910198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic"},{"name":"Risperidone","weight":0.903216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risperidone"},{"name":"Microglia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.879114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Brain ischemia","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_ischemia"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.761545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.702583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.615544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Gerbil","weight":0.575874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbil"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.549851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Hippocampus anatomy","weight":0.319932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus_anatomy"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.227269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"}]}
