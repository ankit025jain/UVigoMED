{"id":81879,"title":"Characterization of genipin-modified dentin collagen.","abstract":"Application of biomodification techniques to dentin can improve its biochemical and biomechanical properties. Several collagen cross-linking agents have been reported to strengthen the mechanical properties of dentin. However, the characteristics of collagen that has undergone agent-induced biomodification are not well understood. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a natural cross-linking agent, genipin (GE), on dentin discoloration, collagen stability, and changes in amino acid composition and lysyl oxidase mediated natural collagen cross-links. Dentin collagen obtained from extracted bovine teeth was treated with three different concentrations of GE (0.01%, 0.1%, and 0.5%) for several treatment times (0-24?h). Changes in biochemical properties of NaB(3)H4-reduced collagen were characterized by amino acid and cross-link analyses. The treatment of dentin collagen with GE resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent pigmentation and stability against bacterial collagenase. The lysyl oxidase-mediated trivalent mature cross-link, pyridinoline, showed no difference among all groups while the major divalent immature cross-link, dehydro-dihydroxylysinonorleucine/its ketoamine in collagen treated with 0.5% GE for 24?h, significantly decreased compared to control (P < 0.05). The newly formed GE-induced cross-links most likely involve lysine and hydroxylysine residues of collagen in a concentration-dependent manner. Some of these cross-links appear to be reducible and stabilized with NaB(3)H4.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795891","annotations":[{"name":"Hydroxylysine","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylysine"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Collagenase","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.630434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.610903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.568006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.458626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lysyl oxidase","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysyl_oxidase"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.219945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.145853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.13988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"General Electric","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Histone H4","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H4"},{"name":"Tritium","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Reductionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
