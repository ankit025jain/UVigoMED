{"id":65957,"title":"[A case report of metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the bladder].","abstract":"70-year-old man was suffering from asymptomatic gross hematuria. Computed tomography demonstrated the mass in the right kidney, bladder, bone and lung. Cystoscopy revealed a solitary, nonpapillary lesion at the right side of the dome. At first, transuretheral resection of bladder tumor was performed. The pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma of unknown origin. Sequentially, retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis of the right renal tumor was also clear cell carcinoma. The diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma metastasized to the bladder, bone and lung. To our knowledge, in Japan, this is the 45th case of metastasis to the bladder of renal cell carcinoma in the literature.
