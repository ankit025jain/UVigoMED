{"id":85680,"title":"Impact of resistance training in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients during periods of acute exacerbation.","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of whole-body resistance training on exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and muscle strength in patients hospitalized for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Randomized controlled trial.University hospital.Patients (N=46) were randomized to either a control group (CG) or training group (TG), and 29 patients completed the study.Training consisted of weight-lifting exercises for 6 muscle groups in the upper and lower limbs (2 sets of 8 repetitions each), and the initial load was set at 80% of the 1-repetition maximum load.Patients were evaluated on the second day of hospitalization, at hospital discharge, and 30 days postdischarge. Patients were evaluated on the basis of the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), HRQOL, muscle strength, systemic inflammatory markers, and level of physical activity in daily life (PADL).The CG showed a reduction in the strength of lower-limb muscles (P<.05) but not in the 6MWD (P>.05). In contrast, patients from the TG improved strength in the lower-limb muscles and 6MWD during and 30 days after hospitalization (P<.05). The TG also improved the impact domain in HRQOL after hospitalization. No improvement in PADL was observed in the TG. Finally, a reduction in the blood levels of inflammatory markers was observed only in the TG after hospitalization.Our results suggest that resistance training during hospitalization improves the 6MWD, HRQOL, and lower-limb muscle strength, without altering the levels of systemic inflammation. However, future research should explore this intervention in larger randomized trials.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879965","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.749819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.391098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.346591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.215692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Olympic weightlifting","weight":0.209144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting"},{"name":"Resistance training","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_training"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
