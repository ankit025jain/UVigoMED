{"id":8921,"title":"[Histopathological changes in EV71-infected mouse model:a transmission electron microscopic study].","abstract":"To document ultrastructural changes of brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscle, jejunum and lung of EV71 infection mouse model, and to explore the myotropism and pathogenesis of EV71 in nervous system.Ten-day-old suckling mice were infected with EV71 strain via the intraperitoneal route. Mice with paralysis were scarified on day 4 post infection and the brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscle, jejunum and lung were sampled for transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy.Lesions in brain were generally mild with inner chamber swelling in some of mitochondria. Myelin sheaths of medullated fibers were split with vacuolated changes. The Nissl bodies in anterior motor neurons disappeared along with mitochondria swelling, rough endoplasmic reticulum swelling and degranulation. Cytoplasm of anterior motor neurons showed cribriform appearance accompanied by neuronophagia. The bands of skeletal muscle in the infected group disappeared with degeneration and karyopyknosis in myocytes, in addition to mitochondrial swelling. Microvilli of epithelium in jejunum became loosely arranged along with formation of spiral medullary sheath structure and mitochondria swelling. Interstitial pneumonia was observed in lungs with type II pneumocyte proliferation and evacuation of the multilamellar bodies.EV71 infection causes severe myositis in the mouse model suggesting a strong myotropism of EV71 virus. The presence of lesions of various degrees in central nervous system and changes in anterior motor neurons may be associated with limb paralysis.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Animal
