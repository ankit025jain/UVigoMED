{"id":29498,"title":"Management of tardive syndromes with clozapine: a case series.","abstract":"Tardive syndromes are among the most debilitating side effects associated with use of antipsychotics. In this case series we present 5 cases of drug induced tardive syndromes, who had not responded to many of the other therapeutic measures but responded to clozapine. The response rate with clozapine varied from 50% to 100% and the response was seen by week 3 in most cases. Over the long term follow-up of as long as 6 years the response to clozapine was sustained. In two cases clozapine could be stopped.
