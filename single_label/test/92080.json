{"id":92080,"title":"Conservative management of pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum in two Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris).","abstract":"Two distressed Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) were reported to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The first animal was determined to be an abandoned, emaciated calf. The second animal was a nursing calf that had sustained watercraft-related trauma. Both animals were captured and transported to Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo, where diagnostic evaluations, including physical examinations, blood work, computed tomography (CT), and radiographs were performed. Radiograph and CT scans identified the presence of free air within the pleural and abdominal cavities of both animals. Based on the lack of substantial findings in the first animal and a rapid resolution of clinical signs in the second animal, both animals were managed conservatively. This report documents simultaneous pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum, the associated clinical and diagnostic findings, and conservative medical management of these conditions in the Florida manatee.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450060","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.902825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.790549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.547122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.510248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.427302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.320374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.13506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Wildlife","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Pneumoperitoneum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumoperitoneum"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Starvation","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
