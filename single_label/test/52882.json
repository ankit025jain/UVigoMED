{"id":52882,"title":"Cardiomyocyte glycophagy is regulated by insulin and exposure to high extracellular glucose.","abstract":"Disturbed systemic glycemic and insulinemic status elicits cardiomyocyte metabolic stress and altered glucose handling. In diabetes, pathological myocardial glycogen accumulation occurs. Recently, evidence of a specific myocardial autophagic degradation pathway for glycogen (\"glycophagy\") has been reported, differentiated from the more well-characterized protein \"macrophagy\" pathway. The goal of this study was to identify potential mechanisms involved in cardiac glycogen accumulation, glycophagy, and macrophagy regulation using cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). In NRVMs, insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation was evident with 5 mM-glucose conditions (?2.3-fold increased). Under high-glucose (30 mM) conditions, insulin-augmented phosphorylation was not observed. Accumulation of glycogen was observed in response to insulin only in high-glucose conditions (?2-fold increase). Increased expression of the glycophagy marker starch-binding domain-containing protein-1 (STBD1, 25% increase) was observed under high-glucose and insulin conditions. Expression levels of the macrophagy markers p62 and light chain protein 3BII:I were not increased by insulin at either glucose level. Preliminary results from hearts of streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats are supportive of the findings obtained in NRVMs, suggesting diabetes induced elevated expression of STBD1 and of an additional glycophagy marker GABA(A) receptor-associated protein-like 1. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that light chain protein 3B and STBD1 immunomarkers were not colocalized in NRVMs. These findings provide the first evidence that cardiomyocyte glycophagy induction occurs under the influence of insulin and is responsive to extracellular high glucose. This study suggests that the regulation of glycogen content and glycophagy induction in the cardiomyocyte may be linked, and it is speculated that glycogen pathology in diabetic cardiomyopathy has glycophagic involvement.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561860","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Glycogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.678266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.524779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.500835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.496718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.320573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.296396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.267996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.224431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.119337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0380153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"}]}
