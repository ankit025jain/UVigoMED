{"id":68644,"title":"Role of BK virus infection in end-stage renal disease patients waiting for kidney transplantation--viral replication dynamics from pre- to post-transplant.","abstract":"We report the prevalence of BK virus (BKV) infection before renal transplantation and the dynamics of BKV viremia from pre- to post-transplantation. We assessed 60 kidney transplanted patients from a single cohort in Italy, treated with identical immunosuppressive therapy, for BK viremia at pre-transplantation, 12 h, and three and six months post-transplantation. Polymerase chain reaction showed that the prevalence of plasma BKV replication--considered a marker of infection--was 20% in pre-transplant patients. All pre-transplant-positive patients remained positive post-transplant, whereas the majority of pre-transplant-negative patients remained negative. Viremia dynamics classification revealed three clusters of patients: Cluster A++, pre-transplant-positive patients (20%) who tested positive at least once post-transplant; Cluster B-+, pre-transplant-negative patients (28%) who tested positive at least once post-transplant; and Cluster C- -, pre-transplant-negative patients (52%) who remained negative throughout. These clusters presented significant differences related to the prevalence of substantially positive patients with high plasma viral load (>10(3) copies/mL) in cluster A, but not in donors' or grafts' characteristics. We suggest that pre-transplant viral status should be considered as an additional risk factor for post-transplant BKV replication. Therefore, pre-transplant BKV infection screening in kidney transplant patients should be performed for improving planning of personalized immunosuppressant schemes and specific post-transplant surveillance.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506672","annotations":[{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.88233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"BK virus","weight":0.848336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK_virus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.541559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.149946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Personality disorder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"}]}
