{"id":51646,"title":"[Clinical observation of intra-operative PTH assay in hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid tumors].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical manifestations and diagnostic method of hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid tumors and to evaluate the intra-operative detection of parathyroid hormone in surgical treatment.Thirty-seven cases with functional parathyroid tumors from January 2003 to October 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical manifestation, examination and operation method, changes of parathyroid hormone before and after operation were collected.All cases were definitely diagnosed before operation. The sensitivity and the positively predictive values of neck ultrasonography were 86.5% and 97.6% respectively, and the same data of Tc-99m-MIBI was 97.2% and 100.0%. The PTH levels declined by 84.9% ten minutes after tumor resecting compared with the level before operation. The serum calcium and PTH returned to normal levels and symptomatic relief occurred after operation.Recurrent bone disease, long-term urinary calculus and obscure gastrointestinal symptoms were common symptoms of hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid tumors. The neck ultrasonography and Tc-99m-MIBI were suitable for location of parathyroid tumors. Surgical operation was an effective treatment for parathyroid tumor. Intra-operative PTH assay would be able to ensure the radical excision and the operative safety for functional parathyroid tumors.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669685","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.685301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.403807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.360144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Renal osteodystrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_osteodystrophy"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
