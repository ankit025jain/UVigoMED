{"id":80443,"title":"[The prevalence of Demodex sp. in patients admitted to the parasitology laboratory of the Dursun Odaba? Medical Center in Yüzüncü Y?l University, Van].","abstract":"The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Demodex sp. in patients referred fom the Dermatology Outpatient Clinic to the Parasitology Laboratory, Dursun Odaba? Medical Center of the Yüzüncü Y?l University.The study was conducted between May 2012-May 2013. The samples were taken from 67 patients using the standard skin surface biopsy method.Demodex sp. mites were identified in 47.4% of 38 women, and in 48.3% of 29 male patients. These mites were detected in 15.8% of 19 patients who were 35 years old and younger, and in 60.4% of 48 patients who were 36 years old and older. Overall, 47.8% (32 patients) of 67 patients were found positive for demodicosis. It was determined that 53.1% of Demodex sp. positive patients had eritemato telangiectatic rosacea, 21.9% had papulo-pustular type rosacea, 18.8% had papules, 3.1% had erythematous pustules, and 3.1% had erythematous squamous plaques. There was a statistically significant difference between the Demodex sp. positivity and age groups (p=0.001).It was concluded that dermatologists should also take into consideration the possible presence of Demodex sp. mites in patients with skin symptoms such as erythema, telangiectasia, papules and pustules, and apply the appropriate treatment for these parasites.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659694","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Parasitology","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitology"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.482679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.204581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Demodicosis","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodicosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Telangiectasia","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangiectasia"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Demodex","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodex"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Van, Turkey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van,_Turkey"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Rosacea","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosacea"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
