{"id":22420,"title":"Emergence of OXA-162-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Hungary.","abstract":"In August 2012, 2 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from the University of Szeged were submitted to the National Reference Laboratory at the National Centre for Epidemiology to confirm the carbapenem resistance mechanism. PCR assays and sequencing revealed that the isolates harboured the blaOXA-162 carbapenemase gene, a very recently described variant of OXA-48, and the blaCTX-M-15 extended-spectrum ?-lactamase gene. The isolates had indistinguishable PFGE patterns and belonged to sequence type ST15. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of OXA-48-like carbapenemase-producing bacteria in Hungary and of an OXA-162-type carbapenemase gene in the K. pneumoniae ST15 clone.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552581","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.842449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.118284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Szeged","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szeged"},{"name":"University of Szeged","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Szeged"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Centre (French region)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(French_region)"},{"name":"Bird species new to science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_species_new_to_science"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Greatest hits album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"}]}
