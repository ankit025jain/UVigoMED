{"id":23693,"title":"Staphylococcal septicaemia associated with peripheral neuropathy in three different clinical settings.","abstract":"Among the various etiologies of peripheral neuropathy, S. aureus is a rare cause that is not even mentioned in standard textbooks. Here we like to report three clinical scenarios where patients with different manifestations of S. aureus infection developed peripheral neuropathy presenting as quadriparesis, which subsided gradually with control of infection and supportive care. No other known causes of peripheral neuropathy were present in these cases.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475686","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.837852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.827032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.651766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.143318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Tetraplegia","weight":0.122452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraplegia"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Textbook","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0116672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
