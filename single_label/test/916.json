{"id":916,"title":"[Influence of right ventricular pacing on tricuspid regurgitation grade--the current state of knowledge].","abstract":"Tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) caused by permanent pacemaker implantation was first described in the eight decade of XX century, however dynamical increase in frequency of pacemaker implantation makes this topic of growing importance. Pacemaker electrode in the right part of the heart could intensify TR, but this dependence is still not clearly understood. Available studies in the most of cases are not related on uniform criteria of TR, what provides difficulties in the analyses. Additional difficulty provides the fact that TR occurs in a high percentage of healthy people. Current literature shows, that risk factors for TR worsening are patients' older age and previously diagnosed valve pathologies. Results of studies concerning influence of number, type, or location of the electrode in the heart on the TR severity are unclear. This article presents current literature review regarding influence of right-sided pacing on the frequency of TR.","date":"2014-12-30","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546917","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.719464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tricuspid valve","weight":0.613415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_valve"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.578614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Tricuspid insufficiency","weight":0.535303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_insufficiency"},{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.390606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.3699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.252612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"}]}
