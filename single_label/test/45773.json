{"id":45773,"title":"Efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: results from the Czech population-based registry.","abstract":"Patients aged 65 years and older represent the majority of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, this patient population is often underrepresented in clinical trials and probably undertreated in the clinical practice.We have analysed the outcomes of 3,187 mCRC patients treated with first-line bevacizumab based on data from the Czech national registry of mCRC patients aiming to compare the treatment efficacy and safety according to the age categories.In total, 2,126 (66.7%), 932 (29.2%), and 129 (4.0%) patients were aged <65 years, 65 to 75 years, and 75+ years, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.4, 11.3, and 11.8 months for patients aged <65 years, 65 to 75 years, and 75+ years, respectively (p = 0.94). Median overall survival (OS) was 26.9, 27.5, and 25.1 months for patients aged <65 years, 65 to 75 years, and 75+ years, respectively (p = 0.73). Using multivariable Cox model for both PFS and OS, the patient age was not significantly associated with either PFS or OS. No increase in bevacizumab-related toxicity was observed among the elderly mCRC patients with the exception of hypertension, which was observed in 71 (3.3%), 34 (3.6%), and 10 (7.8%) patients aged <65 years, 65 to 75 years, and 75+ years, respectively.The results of the present study suggest similar outcome in terms of OS and PFS with bevacizumab-containing therapy in elderly mCRC patients fit for chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy compared to younger patients. Thus, chronological age should not be considered to represent a limitation in prescribing bevacizumab-containing therapy in mCRC patients.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666582","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.5964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.236941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.189214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"932","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/932"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Czech Republic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"},{"name":"Chronology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
