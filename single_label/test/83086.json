{"id":83086,"title":"Global developmental delay with sodium valproate-induced gingival hyperplasia.","abstract":"Global developmental delay (GDD) refers to a disturbance in an individual child across one or more developmental domains, which include motor, cognition, daily activities, speech and language. The present case discusses a 5-year-old child with GDD associated with infantile spasms treated with sodium valproate. Delay in the widespread acquisition of skills, epilepsy and poor oral hygiene with gingival enlargement was the main concern to seek medical aid. This case is special as the child was suffering from GDD associated with sodium valproate-induced gingival enlargement.
