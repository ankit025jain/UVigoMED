{"id":56591,"title":"Ambiguous role of glucocorticoids on survival of retinal neurons.","abstract":"Glucocorticoids (GCs) have a wide range of functions on several mammalian cell types, most of which are aimed at boosting survival, which is the raison d'Ãªtre of the acute stress response. The role GCs play in the survival and viability of neurons is incongruous, as studies have revealed neuroprotective as well as neurodegenerative effects. These effects seem to depend on multiple factors amongst which are; the cell type involved, the mode of injury or underlying cause of cell death, likewise the concentration and or duration of GC exposure.In this mini review, we discuss mechanisms of GC action and their effect on neurodegeneration in general, and specifically review the effect of GCs on retinal neurons, in animal models of retinal degeneration or acute neuronal damage. Finally, we summarize potential protective and harmful GC-mediated mechanisms, which might be involved in the determination of neuronal fate in the retina following injury or during degeneration.
