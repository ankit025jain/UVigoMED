{"id":45157,"title":"Sorafenib in liver function impaired advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To explore the efficacy and safty of sorafenib in Child-Pugh class B to class C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).In this three-center open-label study from November 2011 to May 2013, we randomly assigned 189 patients with advanced Child-Pugh class B or C HCC patients into two groups, one group with 95 patient to receive sorafenib (400 mg a time, twice a day) and the other group with 94 patients to receive best supportive care. The primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival.The median progression-free survival was 2.2 months and 1.9 months in the sorafenib group and best supportive care group respectively (Hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.75; P=0.002). The median overall survival was 4.0 months and 3.5 months in the sorafenib group and best supportive care group respectively (Hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.68; P<0.001). The main adverse effect of sorafenib was rash and acne of the skin (in 51.7% patients). The incidences of severe rash, diarrhea, and dry skin were 5.6%, 5.6%, and 2.2% in the sorafenib group. One patient reached partial response in the sorafenib group.Sorafenib is safe in patients with liver function impaired advanced HCC. It is effective in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival compared with best supportive care. Liver functions are the important predictive factors.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698672","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.86591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acne","weight":0.528712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.477993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Misuse of Drugs Act 1971","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_Drugs_Act_1971"},{"name":"Xeroderma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeroderma"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"List of North American broadcast station classes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
