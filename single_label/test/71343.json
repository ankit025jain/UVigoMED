{"id":71343,"title":"Health risk assessment of dietary exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Taiyuan, China.","abstract":"Sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in 24 duplicate-diet samples from people in Taiyuan during summer and winter in 2009. Dietary intake of PAHs for 2862 participants was subsequently estimated by a survey in Taiyuan. Results from these 24 samples were compared with a raw food study in Taiyuan in 2008. Three main sources of dietary PAHs are vegetables, wheat flour and fruits, the sum of which contributes 75.95% of PAHs in dietary food. Compared to the estimated value in raw food, much more B[a]P(eq) (benzo[a]pyrene equivalents) were detected in food samples collected in the duplicate-diet study in Taiyuan (60.75 ng/day). The cooking process may introduce more B[a]P(eq) into food, and the relative contribution of 16 PAHs in the diet would be changed during the cooking procedure.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076535","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.599225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Cooking","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Flour","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour"},{"name":"Raw foodism","weight":0.316728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_foodism"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.308579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.296728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"Taiyuan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiyuan"},{"name":"Health risk assessment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_risk_assessment"},{"name":"Aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Food sampling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_sampling"},{"name":"Wheat flour","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_flour"}]}
