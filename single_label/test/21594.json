{"id":21594,"title":"Immunological markers that correlate with protection immunity against tularemia infection.","abstract":"An efficient immune response to tularemia is dependent on a strong cell-mediated component. We tried to identify markers of cellular immune responses that indicate a vaccine efficacy against tularemia. BALB/c mice were immunized with mutant F. tularensis 15?23A and/or F. tularensis 15 NIIEG strains and then were challenged i.n. with F. tularensis Schu. We compared the influence of F. tularensis antigens (tularinum) in vitro on production of IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-?, and TNF-? by splenocytes obtained from intact mice and mice immunized with mutant F. tularensis 15?23A and/or F. tularensis 15 NIIEG strains. We also compared expression of CD28, CD154, TLR-2, and CD69 markers on CD4 and CD8 T-cells after activation with tularinum in vitro. We found that tularinum-induced CD4(+) T-cells increased TNF-? and IFN-? synthesis and expression of CD69 only in group mice with high degree of post immunization protection against F. tularensis Schu challenge. Estimation of CD69 expression on CD3(+)CD4(+) cells and IFN-?, TNF-? synthesis by CD4(+) T-lymphocytes could be useful for determination protect ability of antitularemia immunity.
