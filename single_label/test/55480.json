{"id":55480,"title":"Tattoo-associated uveitis.","abstract":"To describe the clinical presentation of uveitis with coincident onset of raised and indurated tattooed skin.Case series.Seven consecutive patients were evaluated at a tertiary ophthalmologic facility with coincident uveitis and cutaneous tattoo induration over an 18-month period. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination and a focused systemic medical evaluation including serologic testing and imaging studies. Two participants underwent biopsy of their tattoos. The patients' clinical courses and responses to treatment over a follow-up period of 1-20 months are reported (mean follow-up = 9 months). Main outcome measures included degree of intraocular inflammation, ocular complications, visual acuity, clinically observable tattooed skin changes, and biopsy results.Five of 7 patients had bilateral nongranulomatous anterior uveitis: 4 with chronic and 1 with recurrent disease. The remaining 2 patients had bilateral chronic granulomatous panuveitis. Biopsies of raised and indurated tattoos were performed in 2 patients and demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation surrounding tattoo ink in the dermis. The skin changes resolved in all patients, with a faster response noted in those treated with high-dose oral prednisone for intraocular inflammation. Five patients subsequently experienced recurrent flares of intraocular inflammation in conjunction with the recurrence of raised and indurated tattoos.These cases represent a subset of patients in whom skin tattooing may have incited an immune response leading to simultaneous inflammation of the eyes and tattooed skin.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875002","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.813111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.586164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Iridocyclitis","weight":0.511662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridocyclitis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.486358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.486317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Tattoo","weight":0.328665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
