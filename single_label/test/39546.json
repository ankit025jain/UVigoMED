{"id":39546,"title":"Standard and reduced radiation dose liver CT images: adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction versus model-based iterative reconstruction-comparison of findings and image quality.","abstract":"To investigate whether reduced radiation dose liver computed tomography (CT) images reconstructed with model-based iterative reconstruction ( MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction ) might compromise depiction of clinically relevant findings or might have decreased image quality when compared with clinical standard radiation dose CT images reconstructed with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction ( ASIR adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction ).With institutional review board approval, informed consent, and HIPAA compliance, 50 patients (39 men, 11 women) were prospectively included who underwent liver CT. After a portal venous pass with ASIR adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction images, a 60% reduced radiation dose pass was added with MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction images. One reviewer scored ASIR adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction image quality and marked findings. Two additional independent reviewers noted whether marked findings were present on MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction images and assigned scores for relative conspicuity, spatial resolution, image noise, and image quality. Liver and aorta Hounsfield units and image noise were measured. Volume CT dose index and size-specific dose estimate ( SSDE size-specific dose estimate ) were recorded. Qualitative reviewer scores were summarized. Formal statistical inference for signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR signal-to-noise ratio ), contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR contrast-to-noise ratio ), volume CT dose index, and SSDE size-specific dose estimate was made (paired t tests), with Bonferroni adjustment.Two independent reviewers identified all 136 ASIR adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction image findings (n = 272) on MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction images, scoring them as equal or better for conspicuity, spatial resolution, and image noise in 94.1% (256 of 272), 96.7% (263 of 272), and 99.3% (270 of 272), respectively. In 50 image sets, two reviewers (n = 100) scored overall image quality as sufficient or good with MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction in 99% (99 of 100). Liver SNR signal-to-noise ratio was significantly greater for MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction (10.8 ± 2.5 [standard deviation] vs 7.7 ± 1.4, P < .001); there was no difference for CNR contrast-to-noise ratio (2.5 ± 1.4 vs 2.4 ± 1.4, P = .45). For ASIR adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction and MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction , respectively, volume CT dose index was 15.2 mGy ± 7.6 versus 6.2 mGy ± 3.6; SSDE size-specific dose estimate was 16.4 mGy ± 6.6 versus 6.7 mGy ± 3.1 (P < .001).Liver CT images reconstructed with MBIR model-based iterative reconstruction may allow up to 59% radiation dose reduction compared with the dose with ASIR adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction , without compromising depiction of findings or image quality.","date":"2014-11-25","categories":"Digestive System
