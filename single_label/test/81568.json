{"id":81568,"title":"Factors related to stability following the surgical correction of skeletal open bite.","abstract":"If a skeletal anterior open bite malocclusion is treated by orthognathic surgery directed only at the mandible, the lower jaw is repositioned upward in a counter-clockwise rotation. However, this procedure has a high risk of relapse. In the present study, the key factors associated with post-surgical stability of corrected skeletal anterior open bite malocclusions were investigated.Eighteen orthognathic patients were subjected to cephalometric analysis to assess the dental and skeletal changes following mandibular surgery for the correction of an anterior open bite. The patients were divided into two groups, determined by an increase or decrease in nasion-menton (N-Me) distance as a consequence of surgery. Changes in overbite, the displacements of molars and positional changes in Menton were evaluated immediately before and after surgery and after a minimum of one year post-operatively.The group with a decreased N-Me distance exhibited a significantly greater backward positioning of the mandible. The group with an increased N-Me distance experienced significantly greater dentoalveolar extrusion of the lower molars.A sufficient mandibular backward repositioning is an effective technique in the prevention of open bite relapse. In addition, it is important not to induce molar extrusion during post-surgical orthodontic treatment to preserve stability of the surgical open bite correction.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968647","annotations":[{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.777456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.657587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.451667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.442581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Menton","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menton"},{"name":"Open bite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_bite"},{"name":"Cephalometric analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometric_analysis"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Rattlesnake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattlesnake"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"List of SPC high-risk days","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SPC_high-risk_days"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Clockwise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
