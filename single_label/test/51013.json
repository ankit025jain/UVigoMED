{"id":51013,"title":"GAL3 protein expression is related to clinical features of prolactin-secreting pituitary microadenoma and predicts its recurrence after surgical treatment.","abstract":"Previous in vitro study showed that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) protein plays an important role in pituitary tumorigenesis, however, the association of Gal-3 expression with the clinical feature and prognosis of pituitary tumor in a clinical setting remains unknown.We enrolled 220 patients with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (PA) who previously had transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. The Gal-3 expression was detected in the patients' PA samples using immunohistochemistry and those patients were followed up. A prolactin-secreting PA cell line, the MMQ cell line, was used to study the in vitro effect of Gal-3 on proliferation, migration and invasion of PA cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfecton technique. The in vivo tumorgenesis in nude mice was also studied.We found that Gal-3 expression was not related to age and sex, but positively associated with tumor invasion (P<0.001), tumor sizes (P<0.001) and pre-operative prolactin levels (P<0.001). The multivariate Cox analysis showed that the Gal-3 expression was closely associated with the recurrence of PA after the surgical treatment (HR =3.15, P=0.002). The in vitro studies showed that Gal-3 knock-down by the siRNA technique significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of the MMQ cells, whereas Gal-3 siRNA transfection induced apoptosis of the MMQ cells. The in vivo tumorgenesis assay showed that Gal-3 siRNA transfection significantly inhibited the tumor volume in vivo compared to transfection of the control siRNA (P<0.001).Gal-3 regulates proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of the MMQ cells. Gal-3 may be used as a tissue marker to evaluate the clinical feature and prognosis of PA patients.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732466","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.747995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.401339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.369223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Galactose","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.127467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"}]}
