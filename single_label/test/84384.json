{"id":84384,"title":"[Spiritual care in hospitals and other healthcare settings in Israel--a profession in the making].","abstract":"Faced with a serious, incurable illness, disability, and other symptoms, both physical and mental, some patients find themselves wondering about the meaning of their Lives. They need the help of a professional who can perceive their mental turmoil and identify their spiritual needs, and who knows how to help them find meaning in their uncertain state. Spiritual care providers are professionals whose role it is to provide patients with support in their hour of need, to help them preserve their identity in life-threatening situations, and to help them re-endow their world with meaning, employing a special language and set of tools that enable patients to get in touch with their spiritual resources and internal powers of healing. Spiritual care providers serve on the medical staff in Western countries. In the United States, some 2,600 are employed in general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, long-term care facilities, and palliative care units. Approximately ten years ago, the profession began developing in Israel. Today, dozens of spiritual care providers are now working in the healthcare system. There is a spiritual care network with 21 member organizations. Although the profession is laying down roots in the healthcare system in this country, it is still in its infancy and has to contend with substantial barriers and challenges, including professional recognition, creating positions, and identifying sources of funding for positions. The profession still has much room to grow as it is further incorporated into the healthcare system and continues undergoing adaptation to the Israeli cultural setting.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112121","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.745867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.715908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.548459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.539994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.518969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.47084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.462611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.417791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.391788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"Television network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_network"},{"name":"Today (NBC program)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)"},{"name":"Root (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"}]}
