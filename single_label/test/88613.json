{"id":88613,"title":"[Clinical evaluation of the shoulder].","abstract":"A systematic clinical examination of the shoulder joint, including a structured medical history, is essential for the diagnosis of shoulder pathologies. Complex clinical situations that are accompanied by pain, restriction of movement, loss of strength, or instability have to be considered in accordance with the functional interaction between the cervical spine, the shoulder girdle, and the glenohumeral joint. Only accurate diagnosis allows us to apply successful therapeutic interventions. In order to achieve this, the physician needs to use standardized clinical tests and signs combined with a profound knowledge of the anatomy and the possible underlying pathologies. To ensure a structured approach as well as a complete documentation of results, a shoulder assessment form should be used. The information obtained from the history, examination, and collected data form the basis for further diagnostic imaging.
