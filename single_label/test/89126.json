{"id":89126,"title":"Short versus long intramedullary nails for treatment of intertrochanteric femur fractures (OTA 31-A1 and A2).","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare blood loss and operative times associated with long versus short intramedullary nails for intertrochanteric fracture fixation and rate of periprosthetic fracture.A retrospective study.Level 1 trauma center.One hundred ninety-four patients with an intertrochanteric fracture (AO/OTA class 31-A1 and A2) and low-energy mechanism of injury treated by 1 of 4 fellowship-trained orthopaedic traumatologists.Short versus long intramedullary nail.Medical records were reviewed for age, gender, estimated blood loss (EBL), transfusion rate, operative time, length of stay, and incidence of periprosthetic fracture. Variables were statistically compared between long and short intramedullary nails, with statistical significance at P < 0.05.The average EBL (135.5 ± 91.9 mL) and transfusion rate (57.1%) for long nails were found to be significantly greater (P = 0.002) than the EBL (92.6 ± 47.2 mL) and transfusion rate (40.2%) for short nails. Average operative time was also found to be significantly greater (P < 0.001) for long (56.8 ± 19.4 minutes) than for short (44.0 ± 10.7 minutes) intramedullary nail procedures. The overall incidence of periprosthetic fracture was 0.5%, one patient with initial treatment of a long intramedullary nail.Statistically significant lower operative time, EBL, and transfusion rate were found in this study for short intramedullary nails. There were no differences seen in length of stay or periprosthetic fracture. The incidence of periprosthetic fracture was very low in both cohorts. Further study with greater statistical power is needed.Therapeutic Level III.
