{"id":42087,"title":"Single-port laparoscopic treatment of small bowel obstruction.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to report our initial experience with single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) for small bowel obstruction (SBO).Between October 2009 and April 2013, 36 patients underwent SPLS for SBO. SPLS was performed transumbilically. Patient demographics and operative and postoperative outcomes were analyzed.SPLS for SBO was successful in 35 patients. In 1 patient, a conversion to laparotomy was required. The median incision length, operative time, and postoperative length of stay were 2.3 cm (range, 1.5 to 5.0 cm), 115 min (range, 30 to 250 min), and 8 days (range, 3 to 26 days), respectively. The median time to resume oral intake was 3 days (range, 1 to 16 days). The intra- and postoperative complication rates were 6% and 11%, respectively.SPLS was a safe and feasible therapeutic approach for SBO and may also be an excellent diagnostic tool when performed by an experienced SPLS surgeon in selected patients.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881018","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.649065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.509082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
