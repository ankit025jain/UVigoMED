{"id":46330,"title":"[Changes in lymphocyte surface expression of CD8 and CD38 molecules in peripheral blood of inactive HBsAg carriers following pegylated interferon a-2a therapy].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of pegylated interferon a-2a (Peg-INFa-2a) treatment on expression of CD8 and CD38 surface molecules on lymphocytes from peripheral blood of inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers.Forty-four patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection (CHB) received a 48-week course of Peg-INFa-2a treatment, with 30 administered 135 mug/week and 14 administered 180 mug/week. Every 12 weeks of treatment, the subjects were assessed for HBsAg titer, presence of anti-hepatitis B e (HBe) antibody, serum alanine amino transaminase (ALT) levels, and lymphocyte surface expression of CD8 and CD38 molecules. Patients were classified as responders and non-responders according to standard parameters. Dynamic differences between the two groups over time were assessed by multivariate repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction and differences at single time points were assessed by univariate ANOVA. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship of two variables.The responders showed a significantly higher increase in ALT at week 12 (60.75+/-24.95 U/L vs. non-responders: 37.03+/-18.45 U/L; t = 2.905, P less than 0.01) and significantly higher proportion of CD8+CD38+ cells at week 24 (71.20+/-11.70% vs. non-responders: 56.79+/-7.72%; F = 23.941, P less than 0.01). The decline in level of HBsAg at week 24 was positively correlated with the increase in ALT level at week 12 (r = 0.386, P less than 0.01) and with expression levels of CD8 and CD38 molecules on lymphocytes at week 24 (r = 0.397, P less than 0.01).Lower baseline levels of HBsAg correlated to better Peg-INFa-2a-related HBsAg clearance. Increased expression of CD8 and CD38 on lymphocytes is suggestive of intensive cellular immunity in CHB patients and may be related to HBV-induced hepatocyte damage and may promote the HBsAg clearance.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636289","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.872993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.8195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.755917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.743102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell-mediated immunity","weight":0.71301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell-mediated_immunity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.703039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.702784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.615129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.602988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.370339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.317942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.215692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.140885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"CD38","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD38"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
