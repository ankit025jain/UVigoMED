{"id":21225,"title":"Tuberculosis: clinical trials and new drug regimens.","abstract":"Recent advances in the development of new drugs and regimens provide hope that well tolerated, effective, and shorter-duration treatments for tuberculosis (TB) will become available. This review covers the recent trials of new TB drugs and regimens.Moxifloxacin and levofloxacin have equally good efficacy and safety in the early phase of treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and linezolid has the potential to cure refractory cases of MDR-TB. Bedaquiline and delamanid may be the best drug candidates for enhancing treatment options for MDR-TB. New chemicals, such as sutezolid, AZD5847, PA-824, SQ109, and BTZ043, show potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Late-generation fluoroquinolones in combination with the first-line and second-line anti-TB drugs have been used to shorten the treatment duration in drug-susceptible and MDR-TB.New drugs and new combination regimens in clinical trials are expected to increase therapeutic efficacy and shorten treatment duration in both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614239","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.516591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.494475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.39567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Linezolid","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linezolid"},{"name":"Levofloxacin","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Moxifloxacin","weight":0.0326281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxifloxacin"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"824","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/824"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Combinatio nova","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatio_nova"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"BTZ black hole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTZ_black_hole"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
