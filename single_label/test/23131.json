{"id":23131,"title":"Randomized controlled trial comparing photodynamic therapy based on methylene blue dye and fluconazole for toenail onychomycosis.","abstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical modality that uses a combination of visible light and a photosensitive compound in the presence of oxygen. It is widely used to treat non-melanoma skin cancer; other indications are being investigated, especially onychomycosis. Eighty patients with toenail onychomycosis were enrolled and completed this randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled study. For 24 weeks, 40 patients (Group A) were treated with one placebo capsule per week and sessions of 2% methylene blue aqueous solution irradiated with light emission diode device (MBLED/PDT) with 18?J/cm(2) ; and another 40 patients (Group B) were treated with 300?mg oral fluconazole per week and sessions of placebo PDT (haematoxylin-diluted 1?:?10). The use of MBLED/PDT consisted of sessions with an interval of 15 days between each session for 6 months. Microbiological and clinical cure was assessed at 1 and 12 months posttreatment. Group A (MBLED/PDT) patients showed a significant response (p < 0.002) compared with Group B (fluconazole), especially in patients who required nail abrasion (p < 0.001). The MBLED/PDT is safe, effective, and well tolerated; it promotes a favorable outcome with good patient adherence and may be considered as a practical and feasible treatment option for toenail onychomycosis.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502311","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.920421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.733472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.728068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.700166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Photosensitivity","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitivity"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.639073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.531296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.366629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.277373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"List of light sources","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_light_sources"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Diode","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode"},{"name":"Onychomycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychomycosis"},{"name":"Methylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Cobalt blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_blue"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
