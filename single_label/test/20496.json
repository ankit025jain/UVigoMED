{"id":20496,"title":"Cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis in a patient after renal transplantation--a case report.","abstract":"A 50-year-old man, who had received an ABO-incompatible living related preemptive renal transplantation 1 year before, presented with painful lesions on both lower extremities and fever. At first, bacterial cellulitis was suspected and antibiotic therapy was initiated, but it was not effective. The serum cryptococcal antigen titer was 1:4,098, and pathologic examination of debrided tissue and wound pus culture revealed cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis. Liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole were started, and repeated debridement and skin grafting were performed. Because his graft function deteriorated because of antibody-mediated rejection and polyoma viral nephropathy, hemodialysis was induced on day 9 of hospitalization. During the treatment, he suffered repeated urinary tract infections, which were treated with antibiotics, and cytomegalovirus retinopathy, which was treated with ganciclovir. His cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis was successfully cured by the combination of antimicrobial treatment and surgical procedures. He could walk with a cane and was discharged on day 298 of hospitalization. Cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis in renal transplant recipients is so rare that only 14 cases have been reported. The mortality is not very high, but the prognosis of the patient is complicated by worsening of the cryptococcal infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Early detection and treatment to prevent spreading to other sites, especially the CNS or disseminated disease, is very important in cases of cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis.
