{"id":66944,"title":"Intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA for overactive bladder.","abstract":"Overactive bladder is a life-compromising disease that affects approximately 11.8% of all men and women, with increasing rates in the elderly. The mainstay of pharmacotherapy for this disease, anticholinergics, has up to a 71% discontinuation rate at 6 months. The emerging data of intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA (onabotA) use for treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder is showing to be an efficacious and well-tolerated alternative to the mainstay of therapy.This study covers the use of onabotA and its use for idiopathic overactive bladder, stemming from its use in neurogenic detrusor overactivity, by evaluating the conclusions of current studies. A literature search and review was carried out for onabotA in treatment of overactive bladder using PubMed.Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that intradetrusor injection with onabotA is effective in treating non-neurogenic bladder with promising efficacy in patients who have failed traditional pharmacotherapy. This treatment may be superior in certain patients due to its higher rate of compliance and higher rates of complete symptom resolution. Long-term studies are needed.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660999","annotations":[{"name":"Botulinum toxin","weight":0.7827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anticholinergic","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.715606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.674607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.608877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.16256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
