{"id":91553,"title":"Comparison of titanium elastic nails with traction and spica cast in treatment of children's femoral shaft fractures.","abstract":"Titanium Elastic Nails (TEN) are commonly used to stabilize femoral fractures in school-aged children, but there have been few studies assessing the risk of traditional traction and application of spica cast. The aim of this study was to compare of titanium elastic nails with traction and spica cast in treatment of children's femoral shaft fractures. A group of thirty children aged 6-12 years with one-sided femoral shaft fracture were randomly allocated either to traction with spica casting group or titanium elastic nails group and were followed up to 1 year. Factors such as age, sex, time needed for walking with aids, time needed for independent walking, time needed for callus formation, time absent from school, time spent in hospital, malunion, malalignment and wound complication were recorded and compared. Fifteen patients (10 boys, 5 girls) with a mean age of 8.33 +/- 1.63 years were treated by traction and spica casting. The other 15 (9 boys, 6 girls) with a mean age of 8.73 +/- 1.53 years underwent surgery using TEN. Mean absence time from school, length of hospital stay, time needed for walking with and without help and angular deviation (varus or valgus) were significantly lower in the group treated by TEN (p-value < 0.05). Time needed for callus formation was significantly lower in spica casting group (p-value < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding malunion wound complications and hospital charges. The results indicated that a child in whom a femoral fracture is treated with TEN achieves recovery milestones significantly faster than a child treated with traction and spica cast.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494521","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.78262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.581115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.347438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.345252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.293164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Femoral fracture","weight":0.205256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_fracture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.0626302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0548502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Flight dynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"TEN (TV station)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEN_(TV_station)"},{"name":"Shaft mining","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_mining"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"}]}
