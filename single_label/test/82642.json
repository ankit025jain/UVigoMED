{"id":82642,"title":"Advancing wellness in the dental office through use of screening and diagnostic technology.","abstract":"Implementing an oral health/systemic health wellness plan for patients can be an important part of a dental practice's proactive approach to healthcare that emphasizes early detection and treatment of disease. As an adjunct to clinical observations, medical history, and patient information gathered and assessed by the practitioner, utilization of screening and diagnostic technology, including oral cancer screening devices, salivary diagnostic tests, and caries detection devices, can aid in the early detection of disease. These tests, which are usually billable, can aid in providing timely, effectual wellness services to patients by enabling practitioners to supply these services more effectively and at an early stage to the benefit of the patient's overall health.
