{"id":20316,"title":"Comparison of VITEK2, MALDI-TOF MS, and 16S rDNA sequencing for identification of Myroides odoratus and Myroides odoratimimus.","abstract":"The genus Myroides comprises the 2 medically relevant species Myroides odoratus and Myroides odoratimimus that are rare opportunistic pathogens and cause infections in immunocompromised patients. A fast identification of Myroides is of importance because these bacterial strains show multiple resistance against antibiotics and therefore limit treatment options. They are associated, for instance, with urinary tract infections, sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and infectious cellulitis. Since more and more Myroides spp. are being described, additional potentially pathogenic bacteria may be identified in the future demanding the need for fast and reliable identification methods at species level. However, to date, only molecular approaches meet these demands. In this study, we, therefore, attempt to define an appropriate method other than DNA fingerprinting that will permit a comparable efficacy and, possibly, a more economical strain identification. For this purpose, we compared 2 widely used automated diagnostic systems (VITEK 2 [bioMérieux, Nürtingen, Germany] and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) [Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany]) and correlated the results to 16S rDNA sequencing data. In total, we analyzed 22 strains collected in the course of routine diagnostics. In this study, we demonstrate that VITEK 2 reliably identifies the genus Myroides but cannot differentiate between M. odoratimimus and M. odoratus. In contrast to this, both MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rDNA sequencing efficiently distinguish between the 2 species.
