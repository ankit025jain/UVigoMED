{"id":42647,"title":"Significance of serum and ascitic fluid C-reactive protein in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ascites.","abstract":"The values of C-reactive protein (CRP) can prove useful in determining disease progress. Because of synthesis by the liver, production of CRP in response to inflammation may be attenuated in patients with liver dysfunction. This may result in differences interpreting CRP levels in patient with portal and non-portal hypertension ascites.The aim of the present study is to assess discriminant value of serum and ascitic fluid CRP, which is easily accessible and inexpensive laboratory marker of inflammation, concentrations for diagnosis of underlying cause of ascites.This prospective study was conducted at D?skap? Y?ld?r?m Beyaz?t Educational and Research Hospital Department of Gastroenterology. Patients with ascites were further divided into two subgroups based on underlying cause of ascites: Group 1, patient with ascites due to portal hypertensive etiology (high-gradient ascites); Group 2, patient with ascites due to non-portal hypertensive etiology (low-gradient ascites).A total of 91 patients fulfilling the criteria for a diagnosis of ascites were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 50 had proven (Group 1) ascites due to portal hypertensive etiology (high-gradient ascites) and 41 had clinical (Group 2) ascites due to non-portal hypertensive etiology (low-gradient ascites). Mean baseline serum and ascites levels of CRP were significantly higher in Group 2 compared to those in Group 1 (p = 0.021, p = <0.0001, respectively).Increased levels of serum and ascitic fluid CRP were associated with malignant ascites.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838501","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.915853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.762319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.580419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.54354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.248557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0394773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Discriminant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Army Medical Department (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Medical_Department_(United_States)"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
