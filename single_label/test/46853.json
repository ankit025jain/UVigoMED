{"id":46853,"title":"[Clinical observation of fluorescence endoscopy in medical diagnosis].","abstract":"It's difficult to diagnose precancerous lesion and early cancer for a long time, because both of them haven't typical morphological characteristics. As a novel diagnostic modality, fluorescence endoscopy can accurately reflect minimal changes in human's tissue, thus making a meaningful progress for cancer diagnosing. 200 patients were examined by fluorescence endoscopy to evaluate the diagnostic value. The overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for detecting malignant gastrointestinal tumor was 94.0%, 94.6% and 93.5%, respectively. Thus, fluorescence endoscopy can be used to diagnose malignant gastrointestinal tumors with high validity and reliability, and is advantageous over conventional white light endoscopy especially in detecting the atypical and suspicious lesions. Furthermore, fluorescence endoscopy can also guide target biopsy, is significant to improve the early cancer detection rate, has a broad development prospect.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617222","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.800817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.745947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.70338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.5415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.399514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.328787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.111667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"}]}
