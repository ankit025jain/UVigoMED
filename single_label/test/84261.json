{"id":84261,"title":"Antiangiogenic and antiproliferative assessment of cyanobacteria.","abstract":"Biologically active compounds with different modes of action, such as antiproliferative, antioxidant, antimicrotubule, have been isolated from algae and cyanobacteria. The present study was designed to evaluate antiangiogenic and antiproliferative potential of dichloromethane and methanol (2:1) extracts of different cyanobacteria. Further fingerprinting of the activity possessing extracts were carried out using ESI-LC-MS/MS. Extracts (25, 50 and 100 microg) were screened in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced angiogenesis in inovo chick chorioallontoic membrane assay (CAM) at various concentrations using thalidomide and normal saline as positive and untreated control groups respectively. The extracts were also evaluated for their antiproliferative activity by MTT assay using HeLa cancer cell line. The results obtained from the various algal extracts did not show any significant antiangiogenic activity as compared to VEGF control. Oscillatoria sp. and Lyngbya officinalis exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity at IC50 values of 220 and 260 microg/mL respectively. ESI-LC-MS/MS of L. officinalis showed the presence of lyngbyatoxin-A and that of Oscillatoria sp. reveals the presence of malyngamide-J suggesting the possibility of antiproliferative activity.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141548","annotations":[{"name":"HeLa","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.805127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Cyanobacteria","weight":0.741171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Algae","weight":0.683973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.573055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.509264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Dichloromethane","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloromethane"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.2865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0788712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"}]}
