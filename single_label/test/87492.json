{"id":87492,"title":"Genetics of osteoporosis.","abstract":"Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, which increases susceptibility to fractures. BMD is a complex quantitative trait with normal distribution and seems to be genetically controlled (in 50-90% of the cases), according to studies on twins and families. Over the last 20 years, candidate gene approach and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with low BMD, osteoporosis, and osteoporotic fractures. These SNPs have been mapped close to or within genes including those encoding nuclear receptors and WNT-?-catenin signaling proteins. Understanding the genetics of osteoporosis will help identify novel candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic targets.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139232","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.705739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.683329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Candidate gene","weight":0.548886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.444457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.386427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.304085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.247559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.239588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.0633088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Genome-wide association study","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
