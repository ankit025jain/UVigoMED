{"id":34871,"title":"Surgical outcomes for congenital lung malformations: 10 years experience at a single center.","abstract":"To study the surgical outcome of congenital lung malformation and natural history of the disease at Srinagarind Hospital.Retrospectively review the medical records of 25 patients diagnosed with congenital lung malformation who underwent surgical treatment between January 2001 and December 2011.Twenty-five patients diagnosed with congenital lung malformation underwent surgery: 16 males (64%), 9 females (36%), median age seven months, median body weight 6 kg. Twelve (48%) had congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation congenital cystic adenomatoidmaflormation (CCAM), seven (28%) pulmonary sequestration, four (16%) congenital lobar emphysema, and one a bronchogenic cyst (4%). The most common presenting symptoms were respiratory tract infection (14, 56%), respiratory distress (7, 28%), lung abscess (1, 4%), hemoptysis (1, 40%), and asymptomatic (2, 8%). Post-operative mortality over 30 days was 0. Complications included lung infection, atelectasis, post-operative bleeding, and wound infection. Post-operative follow-up (lasting between 1-8 years) revealed normal tolerance to daily activity without any respiratory problems.Surgical treatment for congenital lung malformations had a good result with few complications.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701729","annotations":[{"name":"Atelectasis","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelectasis"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.748461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.735011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.655162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.559626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pulmonary sequestration","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_sequestration"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.314275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lung abscess","weight":0.301989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_abscess"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.241231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"}]}
