{"id":89023,"title":"Effect of depression on femoral head avascular necrosis from femoral neck fracture in patients younger than 60 years.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of depression on femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) from femoral neck fracture in patients younger than 60 years and the relationship between depression and postoperative quality of life. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was completed by 641 patients (352 men and 289 women; average age, 41.7Â±10.2 years; range, 20-60 years) postoperatively. Patients were divided into groups according to BDI-II score: a depressed group (BDI-II score of 14 or higher) and a nondepressed group (BDI-II score lower than 14). They were followed for an average of 28 months (range, 24-37 months). The postoperative diagnosis was confirmed by typical radiographs and single photon-emission computed tomography. Quality of life among patients was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. The overall incidences of depression and AVN were 30.6% (196 of 641) and 20.9% (134 of 641), respectively. Ninety-four (48.0%) patients in the depressed group and 40 (9.0%) patients in the nondepressed group ultimately developed AVN. Symptoms of depression significantly affected AVN. In addition, depression predicted patients' quality of life, as did sex, partner status, employment status, living alone, frequency of exercise, severity of fractures, and length of hospital stay. In a multiple linear regression model analyzing all of these variables, depression was the best independent predictor of quality of life. Depression in patients younger than 60 years with femoral neck fractures may increase postoperative femoral head AVN risk and greatly affect patients' quality of life.
