{"id":39182,"title":"Clinical and radiologic evaluation of patients before TIPS creation.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to highlight the clinical and radiologic evaluation of patients referred for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation.TIPS creation is an effective procedure for portal diversion in the setting of recurrent variceal bleeding or diuretic refractory ascites secondary to portal hypertension. Close collaboration between hepatologists and interventional radiologists is important for appropriate patient selection. Pre-procedural clinical and radiologic evaluation is fundamental for successful management of these patients.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247938","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjugular_intrahepatic_portosystemic_shunt"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.781457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.402244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.0261198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
