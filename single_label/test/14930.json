{"id":14930,"title":"An update on approaches to controlling coccidia in poultry using botanical extracts.","abstract":"1. This paper reviews the use of botanical extracts in the control of coccidial infection in poultry. 2. Some plants and their respective volatile oils and extracts have the potential to alleviate coccidiosis and reduce its severity. 3. Most plant bioactives improve some, but not all, aspects of coccidiosis with variable effectiveness against different species of Eimeria. 4. Difficulties in comparing research findings have arisen from the use of different experimental models, different active components and infectious dose of Eimeria. 5. Current knowledge of their potential anti-coccidial effects may provide guidance for the use of botanical extracts in the control of the coccidiosis.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397508","annotations":[{"name":"Plant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Botany","weight":0.497213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.292202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.227383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.123231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Coccidia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidia"},{"name":"Eimeria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eimeria"},{"name":"Volatility (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Passivity (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivity_(engineering)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
