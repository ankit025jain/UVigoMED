{"id":89579,"title":"Infrared-induced adult colloid milium treated with fractionated CO2 laser.","abstract":"Adult colloid milium is a rare cutaneous deposition disorder that frequently involves areas of chronic sun exposure. The most common clinical presentation exhibits multiple, firm, and amber-colored papules that cluster to form large plaques. Histologically, there are masses of amorphous, eosinophilic material expanding the papillary dermis, and at times extending into the mid-dermis, with adjacent solar elastosis. When this disorder affects the face, disfiguring is of great concern and treatment is often sought. Attempts to safely remove colloid milium are generally unsuccessful. Dermabrasion has been reported to be effective. The present authors present a case with extensive facial colloid milium successfully ablated by the fractionated CO2 laser.
