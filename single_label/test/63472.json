{"id":63472,"title":"Synthesis, antitubulin, and antiproliferative SAR of C3/C1-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines.","abstract":"The syntheses and antiproliferative activities of novel substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives and their sulfamates are discussed. Biasing of conformational populations through substitution on the tetrahydroisoquinoline core at C1 and C3 has a profound effect on the antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines. The C3 methyl-substituted sulfamate (Â±)-7-methoxy-2-(3-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (6 b), for example, was found to be ?10-fold more potent than the corresponding non-methylated compound 7-methoxy-2-(3-methoxybenzyl)-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (4 b) against DU-145 prostate cancer cells (GI50 values: 220 nM and 2.1 ?M, respectively). Such compounds were also found to be active against a drug-resistant MCF breast cancer cell line. The position and nature of substitution of the N-benzyl group in the C3-substituted series was found to have a significant effect on activity. Whereas C1 methylation has little effect on activity, introduction of C1 phenyl and C3-gem-dimethyl substituents greatly decreases antiproliferative activity. The ability of these compounds to inhibit microtubule polymerisation and to bind tubulin in a competitive manner versus colchicine confirms the mechanism of action. The therapeutic potential of a representative compound was confirmed in an in vivo multiple myeloma xenograft study.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24436228","annotations":[{"name":"Microtubule","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.761605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.750059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Tubulin","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubulin"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Methoxy","weight":0.676261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxy"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.673222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Polymerization","weight":0.606567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.55219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.414591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Substituent","weight":0.392151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent"},{"name":"Organic synthesis","weight":0.374546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_synthesis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.367615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.361749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colchicine","weight":0.337806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.266389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.113159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Sulfamic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfamic_acid"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Tetrahydroisoquinoline","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydroisoquinoline"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Structure-activity relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure-activity_relationship"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
