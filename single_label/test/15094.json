{"id":15094,"title":"[MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometric analysis of cell proteins during identification of leptospira genus members].","abstract":"Development of methodological approaches for identification of leptospira by using MALDI-TOF direct protein profiling technology.Analysis of cell proteins of 34 leptospira strains was carried out in Microflex LT by using \"MALDI Biotyper 3.0 for identification and classification of microorganisms\" program.19 reference spectra of reference leptospira strains from 7 species were generated and imported into MALDI Biotyper 3.0 database. Identification of 6 strains with undetermined taxonomic position was carried out.The approved method allows determination of leptospira species with accuracy that depends on their adaptation to nutrient media, preparation approach and sample storage conditions for mass-spectrometry.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286526","annotations":[{"name":"Genus","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.789718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.763288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.375104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.278019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.151817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.139558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.131745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization"},{"name":"Leptospira","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospira"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Computer data storage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Storage of wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_of_wine"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
