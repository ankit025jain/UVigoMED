{"id":52962,"title":"Akt-mediated cardioprotective effects of aldosterone in type 2 diabetic mice.","abstract":"Studies have shown that aldosterone would have angiogenic effects and therefore would be beneficial in the context of cardiovascular diseases. We thus investigated the potential involvement of aldosterone in triggering a cardiac angiogenic response in the context of type-2 diabetes and the molecular pathways involved. Male 3-wk-old aldosterone synthase (AS)-overexpressing mice and their control wild-type (WT) littermates were fed a standard or high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. After 6 mo of diet treatment, mice were euthanized, and cardiac samples were assayed by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistology. HFHS diet induced type-2 diabetes in WT (WT-D) and AS (AS-D) mice. VEGFa mRNAs decreased in WT-D (-43%, P<0.05 vs. WT) and increased in AS-D mice (+236%, P< 0.01 vs. WT-D). In WT-D mouse hearts, the proapoptotic p38MAPK was activated (P<0.05 vs. WT and AS-D), whereas Akt activity decreased (-64%, P<0.05 vs. WT). The AS mice, which exhibited a cardiac up-regulation of IGF1-R, showed an increase in Akt phosphorylation when diabetes was induced (P<0.05 vs. WT and AS-D). Contrary to WT-D mice, AS-D mouse hearts did not express inflammatory markers and exhibited a normal capillary density (P<0.05 vs. WT-D). To our knowledge, this is the first study providing new insights into the mechanisms whereby aldosterone prevents diabetes-induced cardiac disorders.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558200","annotations":[{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.833959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.662088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.619436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.491465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.341938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.249922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1_receptor"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Aldosterone synthase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone_synthase"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"}]}
