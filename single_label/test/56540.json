{"id":56540,"title":"Primary and secondary implantation of scleral-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lenses in adult patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate and to compare the results of primary and secondary scleral-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantations in adult patients.A retrospective analysis of scleral-fixated PCIOLs-implanted during (primary group) or after (secondary group) cataract surgery was performed. The median follow-up time of 96 patients was 6 months (minimum: 6; maximum: 35 months). Outcome measures were indications, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), change in visual acuity and complications.A total of 37 patients (38.5%) had primary implantations and 59 (61.5%) had secondary implantations. Penetrating keratoplasty was combined with secondary implantation in 13 cases. The median post-operative CDVA was 0.5 in decimal notation in both groups (P = 0.576). The CDVA improved by at least one Snellen line or remained unchanged in 35 eyes (94.6%) in the primary group and in 52 eyes (88.1%) in the secondary group (P = 0.263). Eyes with CDVA of 0.5 or higher were 62.2% (n = 23) in the primary group and 67.8% (n = 40) in the secondary group post-operatively (P = 0.066). The difference in early and late complications were not statistically significant between groups (P = 0.637, P = 0.154, respectively). Regarding late complications, 30 eyes (81%) in the primary group and 40 eyes (67.9%) in the secondary group had no complications (P = 0.154).Both primary and secondary scleral-fixated PCIOL implantations can provide favorable visual outcomes with lower complication rates. An important consideration is the appropriate timing for scleral fixation, taking into account the patient's characteristics and the course of the operation.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669145","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.79756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Posterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.515055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.374132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.212711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Decimal","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Primary and secondary groups","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_groups"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
