{"id":35916,"title":"Neonatal progeroid variant of Marfan syndrome with congenital lipodystrophy results from mutations at the 3' end of FBN1 gene.","abstract":"We report a 16-year-old girl with neonatal progeroid features and congenital lipodystrophy who was considered at birth as a possible variant of Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome. The emergence of additional clinical signs (marfanoid habitus, severe myopia and dilatation of the aortic bulb) lead to consider the diagnosis of the progeroid variant of Marfan syndrome. A de novo donor splice-site mutation (c.8226+1G>A) was identified in FBN1. We show that this mutation leads to exon 64 skipping and to the production of a stable mRNA that should allow synthesis of a truncated profibrillin-1, in which the C-terminal furin cleavage site is altered. FBN1 mutations associated with a similar phenotype have only been reported in four other patients. We confirm the correlation between marfanoid phenotype with congenital lipodystrophy and neonatal progeroid features (marfanoid-progeroid-lipodystrophy syndrome) and frameshift mutations at the 3' end of FBN1. This syndrome should be considered in differential diagnosis of neonatal progeroid syndromes.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613577","annotations":[{"name":"Marfan syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.715199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.672012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.461637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Lipodystrophy","weight":0.390777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipodystrophy"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.294691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Translational frameshift","weight":0.262604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Furin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furin"},{"name":"FBN1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBN1"},{"name":"Marfanoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfanoid"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Bulb","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb"},{"name":"De novo","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"}]}
