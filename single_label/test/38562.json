{"id":38562,"title":"Two novel VPS33B mutations in a patient with arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis syndrome in mainland China.","abstract":"Arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder and has not been described in China. We present a female infant with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis from a Chinese family with ARC syndrome. All 23 coding exons and flanking introns of the VPS33B gene were amplified and sequenced using peripheral lymphocyte genomic DNA of the patient and her parents. Genetic testing revealed two novel mutations (c.1033delA and c.1567C>T) in the VPS33B gene. The patient is a compound heterozygote and her parents were heterozygous for each of the mutations.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415890","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.869195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.813142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Heterozygote","weight":0.765447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Intron","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.646195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"China","weight":0.632776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Compound heterozygosity","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_heterozygosity"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.188149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.112367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Arthrogryposis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"}]}
