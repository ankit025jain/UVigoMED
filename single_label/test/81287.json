{"id":81287,"title":"Does post-bleaching fluoridation affect the further demineralization of bleached enamel? An in vitro study.","abstract":"Topical fluoride agents have been shown to be the most effective method in treating demineralized enamel after in-office bleaching treatments. Thus, this study aimed to examine the effects of two different post-bleaching fluoridation agents: 1.5% titanium tetrafluoride (TiF(4)) (9200 ppm) and 2.1% sodium fluoride (NaF) (9500 ppm), on the calcium loss of enamel after an acidic challenge.Ten maxillary premolars were sectioned into four pieces and then divided into the following four groups: Group 1: Control, kept in artificial saliva, no treatment; Group 2: 38% hydrogen peroxide (HP); Group 3: 38% HP followed by 1.5% TiF(4); Group 4: 38% HP followed by 2.1% NaF solution. The specimens were subjected to demineralization for 16 days, refreshing the solution every 4 days; that is, on the 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th days. Calcium ion (Ca(2+)) concentration was determined by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests (p = 0.05).The loss of Ca(2+) in each of the test groups was compared with that of the control group, depicting that there was a statistically significant difference among the groups after 4, 8, 12, and 16 days and in total (p < 0.05). The calcium released from the fluoride-applied groups was lower when compared with the 38% HP and control group. At the end of the 16th day, the total amount of calcium released from the TiF(4-)treated samples (9.12 mg/mL) was less than from the NaF-treated samples (13.67 mg/mL) (p < 0.05).Regarding the results of our in vitro study, the risk of further demineralization was significantly reduced with the use of TiF(4) and NaF after bleaching with 38% HP. TiF(4) was found to be more effective in preventing Ca2+ release owing to acid attack when compared with NaF. In the case of an intra-oral acidic exposure, the use of topical 1.5% TiF(4) and 2.1% NaF agents might be beneficial after bleaching with 38% HP.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193250","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.854727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.827774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.822632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Bleach","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.669301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.659469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Water fluoridation","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.578086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.214801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Bleaching of wood pulp","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleaching_of_wood_pulp"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Atomic absorption spectroscopy","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
