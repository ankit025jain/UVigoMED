{"id":51467,"title":"Experimental and simulation study of the wavelength dependent second harmonic generation of collagen in scattering tissues.","abstract":"We report on the wavelength dependence of second harmonic generation (SHG) of collagen in scattering tissues over the wavelength range of 800-1200 nm. The study incorporates inclusion of the molecular hyperpolarizability ? of collagen and optical scattering, both of which are wavelength dependent. Using 3D SHG imaging and Monte Carlo simulations, we find the wavelength dependence of ? is not well described by a two-state model based on known absorption bands. We further find that longer wavelength excitation is inefficient as the reduction in scattering is overcome by the decreased ? far from resonance and the optimal excitation is within the 800-900 nm range. The impact is larger for backward collected SHG.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686633","annotations":[{"name":"Scattering","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"},{"name":"Wavelength","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Nonlinear optics","weight":0.737187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Spectral line","weight":0.518596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.344357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Harmonic","weight":0.328677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.300168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Excited state","weight":0.230474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.213858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Monte Carlo method","weight":0.181975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"},{"name":"Second-harmonic generation","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.131569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.129167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Hyperpolarizability","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpolarizability"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Electricity generation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Pareto efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
