{"id":81872,"title":"Amount of interleukin-1? and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in periodontitis and healthy patients.","abstract":"Regulation of interleukin-1? (IL-1?) is a critical element of immune responses in health and disease. Additional research is required to determine the levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) sufficient to inhibit inteleukine-1-induced responses in periodontium. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of IL-1?, IL-1ra in gingival crevicular fluid samples obtained from periodontitis and healthy patients.The periodontitis group consisted of 50 patients (F-31, M-19) with chronic periodontitis. The control group consisted of 30 periodontally healthy subjects (F-19, M-11). Oral hygiene index-simplified, gingival index, pocket depth, clinical attachment level were measured. The concentrations of interleukins in gingival crevicular fluid were measured by the ELISA technique.The total amounts of interleukin-1? and IL-1ra were significantly higher in periodontitis group than in the control group (P<0.05). The levels of each cytokine were reported also as moles. In the control group there were 800-times more moles/sample of IL-1ra than IL-1?. In periodontitis group nearly 300-times more moles/sample of IL-1ra was obtained. The significant positive Spearman's rank correlations was identified between both concentrations (R=0.39; P<0.05) and total amounts (R=0.31; P<0.05) of cytokines in the periodontitis group.The increased secretion of IL-1ra in periodontitis is not adequate to \"curb\" the release of IL-1?.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798982","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.533002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.426962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.403539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.383037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.378195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"M11 motorway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M11_motorway"},{"name":"Gingival sulcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_sulcus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Curb (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_(road)"}]}
