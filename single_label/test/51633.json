{"id":51633,"title":"Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy: tips and pearls for the surgical technique.","abstract":"The objectives of this study were first to show principles of the minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT), based on a video highlighting critical steps, and second to discuss tips and pearls to assist surgical teams that would like to start using this technique.Based on a video, we described tips and pearls of a MIVAT.MIVAT includes 5 main steps: (1) skin incision and identification of the common carotid artery, (2) dissection and ligation of the upper pedicle, (3) identification of the inferior laryngeal nerve and parathyroid glands, (4) isthmectomy and lobe extraction, and (5) closure.Coordination between the surgeon and the 2 assistants is of paramount importance for the performance of MIVAT. Appropriate material is also required. The magnification and tissue contrast emphasizes the identification of the vessels, the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves, and parathyroid glands, on a large-view screen.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671545","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.878309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.682375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.523477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.380654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pearl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Laryngeal nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_nerve"}]}
