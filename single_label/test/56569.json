{"id":56569,"title":"Antioxidant therapy for retinal disease.","abstract":"Disease mechanisms associated with retinal disease are of immense complexity, mutations within 45 genes having been implicated, for example, in retinitis pigmentosa, while interplay between genetic, environmental, and demographic factors can lead to diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. In light of such diversity, any therapeutic modality that can be targeted to an early molecular process instrumental in multiple forms of disease, such as oxidative stress, holds much attraction. Here, we provide a brief overview of a selection of compounds displaying antioxidant activity, which have been shown to slow down degeneration of retinal tissues and highlight suggested modes of action.
