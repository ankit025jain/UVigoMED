{"id":87712,"title":"Emergency medical services response to active shooter incidents: provider comfort level and attitudes before and after participation in a focused response training program.","abstract":"Emergency Medical Services (EMS) routinely stage in a secure area in response to active shooter incidents until the scene is declared safe by law enforcement. Due to the time-sensitive nature of injuries at these incidents, some EMS systems have adopted response tactics utilizing law enforcement protection to expedite life-saving medical care.Describe EMS provider perceptions of preparedness, adequacy of training, and general attitudes toward active shooter incident response after completing a tactical awareness training program.An unmatched, anonymous, closed-format survey utilizing a five-point Likert scale was distributed to participating EMS providers before and after a focused training session on joint EMS/police active shooter rescue team response. Descriptive statistics were used to compare survey results. Secondary analysis of responses based on prior military or tactical medicine training was performed using a chi-squared analysis.Two hundred fifty-six providers participated with 88% (225/256) pretraining and 88% (224/256) post-training surveys completed. Post-training, provider agreement that they felt adequately prepared to respond to an active shooter incident changed from 41% (92/225) to 89% (199/224), while agreement they felt adequately trained to provide medical care during an active shooter incident changed from 36% (82/225) to 87% (194/224). Post-training provider agreement that they should never enter a building with an active shooter changed from 73% (165/225) to 61% (137/224). Among the pretraining surveys, significantly more providers without prior military or tactical experience agreed they should never enter a building with an active shooter until the scene was declared safe (78% vs 50%, P = .002), while significantly more providers with prior experience felt both adequately trained to provide medical care in an active shooter environment (56% vs 31%, P = .007) and comfortable working jointly with law enforcement within a building if a shooter were still inside (76% vs 56%, P = .014). There was no difference in response to these questions in the post-training survey.Attitudes and perceptions regarding EMS active shooter incident response appear to change among providers after participation in a focused active shooter response training program. Further studies are needed to determine if these changes are significant and whether early EMS response during an active shooter incident improves patient outcomes.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006975","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.619937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.574907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Law enforcement agency","weight":0.0524933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Shooting sport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sport"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Lifeguard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeguard"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Computer security incident management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security_incident_management"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Active shooter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shooter"},{"name":"Large Group Awareness Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Group_Awareness_Training"}]}
