{"id":68117,"title":"A case of sustained virologic response of HCV with telaprevir-based therapy in a patient with HIV and end stage kidney disease.","abstract":"Sustained virologic response rates for hepatitis C virus are difficult to achieve in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, especially if they have other poor predictors of response. Rates of sustained virologic response for hepatitis C virus genotype 1 in patients with end stage kidney disease are lower than patients with normal renal function. We present the first case report of a co-infected African American man with end stage kidney disease, who was haemodialysis dependant, and an interferon non-responder with advanced liver fibrosis, who achieved sustained virologic response on a telaprevir-based regimen.
