{"id":68166,"title":"Expression of CD9 and CD82 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and its clinical significance.","abstract":"CD9 and CD82, members of the tetraspanin family, act as metastasis suppressors in many human malignant tumors, but the role of these molecules is not well known in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). This study was designed to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of CD9 and CD82 in 644 cases of CCRCC and to determine the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of their expression. The percentage of positive tumor cells was evaluated, and the expression was classified into 2 categories: low expression (less than 10% positive cells) or high expression (more than 10% positive cells) for CD9 expression and negative (no positive cells) or positive for CD82 expression. CD9 high expression was found in 303 (47.0%) patients, and CD82 positivity was found in 98 (15.2%) patients. High expression of CD9 was statistically associated with older patients (p=0.003). The cases showing positive immunoreactivity for CD82 exhibited a high stage (p<0.001) and high nuclear grade (p<0.001). The overall, cancer-specific and progression-free survival rates were significantly higher in patients with a CD82-negative profile compared to patients with a CD82-positive profile (p<0.001). Although the biological function of CD82 in CCRCC remains unclear, the CCRCC patients with CD82 positive expression show poor prognosis.
