{"id":47423,"title":"Ogilvie syndrome: a potentially life-threatening phenotype of immobilization hypercalcemia.","abstract":"Ogilvie syndrome, also known as acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, is characterized by the clinical presentation and imaging evidence of acute colonic obstruction in the absence of a mechanical cause. Several comorbidities and serious associated medical or surgical conditions have been described to be relevant to this syndrome. In general, a preferred initial management with favorable treatment outcomes is virtually to correct underlying disorders. Although disrupted electrolyte homeostasis may induce impaired colonic motility, hypercalcemia secondary to immobilization as a major culprit in this syndrome has rarely been studied. In this report, we profiled radiographic features, therapeutic strategies, and pathogenetic hypothesis of this clinical entity and highlighted the need for clinicians to maintain awareness of this distinct manifestation.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589023","annotations":[{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.733597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.645467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.532844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypercalcaemia","weight":0.529967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalcaemia"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.42989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Intestinal pseudoobstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_pseudoobstruction"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
