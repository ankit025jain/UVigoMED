{"id":1198,"title":"Surgical treatment of giant aneurysm of hepatic artery: report of three cases.","abstract":"To explore the surgical way of treating giant hepatic artery aneurysm(HAA).Three hepatic artery aneurysm patients who were performed aneurysm resection without revascularization of the hepatic artery were reviewed. After surgery, the values of liver function and enhanced CT scan of the patients were followed.All the three patients were recovered well postoperatively and only several values of biochemistry marks of liver function as ALT, AST, TBIL and DB in one case with liver cirrhosis were elevated and decreased to normal ranges in a few days postoperatively. The values of biochemistry marks of liver function in other two cases were within normal limits. The enhanced CT scan also showed arteries in the liver after hepatic artery aneurysm resection.Giant HAA may be safely removed without revascularization of the hepatic artery.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436281","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.691044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.690704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.561866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.425994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.273383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Common hepatic artery","weight":0.161111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_hepatic_artery"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Deutsche Bahn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bahn"},{"name":"Multivalued function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivalued_function"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
