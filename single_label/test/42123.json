{"id":42123,"title":"Multidetector computed tomography of superior mesenteric artery: anatomy and pathologies.","abstract":"The recent introduction of multidetector computed tomography scanners has significantly improved computed tomography angiographic (CTA) applications, especially for the evaluation of medium- and small-arterial structures. CTA of the superior mesenteric artery has been reported previously. However, there have been few systematic and detailed reviews of the superior mesenteric artery pathologies that use CTA. The purpose of this pictorial essay is mainly to review the various superior mesenteric artery pathologies at CTA with our own experiences.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874500","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.587655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric artery","weight":0.274145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_artery"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.236714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Essay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"List of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chicago_Transit_Authority_bus_routes"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0106373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
