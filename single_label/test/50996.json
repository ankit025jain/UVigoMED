{"id":50996,"title":"?-cell telomere attrition in diabetes: inverse correlation between HbA1c and telomere length.","abstract":"Although accelerated ?-cell telomere shortening may be associated with diabetes that shows a dramatically increased incidence with aging, ?-cell telomere length in diabetes has never been explored.The objective of the present study was to examine telomere length in the ?-cells of patients with diabetes.We determined telomere length in ?- and ?-cells of pancreases obtained at autopsy from 47 patients with type 2 diabetes and 51 controls, all older than 60 years.The normalized telomere to centromere ratio (NTCR), an index of telomere length, was determined for ?- (NTCR?) and ?- (NTCR?) cells by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization.The NTCR? was reduced by 27% ± 25% and NTCR? by 15% ± 27% in the patients with diabetes relative to the controls (P < .01 for both). Importantly, the degree of shortening was significantly (P < .01) greater in ?-cells than in ?-cells. The histogram of NTCR distribution was significantly skewed to the left in the patients with diabetes relative to the controls for both ?- and ?-cells, indicating preferential depletion of longer-telomere islet cells. Glycated hemoglobin was negatively correlated with ?-cell telomere length, and the telomeres were significantly shorter in patients who had used hypoglycemic agents than in those who had not.The telomeres of ?-cells are shortened in patients with type 2 diabetes. There may be a vicious cycle involving ?-cell telomere attrition and sustained hyperglycemia.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735425","annotations":[{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.9371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.646655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Histogram","weight":0.645301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.61834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.491877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.414524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.4,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.228415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.087094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.06086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Normalization (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Skewness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Virtuous circle and vicious circle","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle"}]}
