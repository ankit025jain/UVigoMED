{"id":16207,"title":"[Measurement of genital mycoplasma concentration by using a microbiological and molecular-biological methods].","abstract":"Establishment of ratios that would allow to execute recalculation of mycoplasma concentration from CFU/ml and/or CCU/ml into units obtained during PCR analysis--geq/ml.Pure cultures of Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum were studied by cultural and molecular-biological methods with quantitative evaluation. Studies of initial cultures as well as series of 10-fold dilutions were carried out. 32 experiments in total were carried out.Ratio between geq/ml and CFU/ml for M. hominis was 3.5; geq/ ml and CCU/ml ratio--4.4. Ratio between geq/ml and CCU/ml for U. parvum was 7.1; for U. urealyticum--11.2.Ratios between indexes obtained during quantitative study of pure genital micoplasma cultures by using 2 methods were established.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051693","annotations":[{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Mycoplasma hominis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_hominis"},{"name":"Ureaplasma urealyticum","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureaplasma_urealyticum"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Ureaplasma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureaplasma"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"The Establishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment"}]}
