{"id":70154,"title":"Heterochromatin domain number correlates with X-ray and carbon-ion radiation resistance in cancer cells.","abstract":"Although it is known that cancer cells can develop radiation resistance after repeated exposures to X rays, the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of this radiation-induced resistance of cancer cells are not well understood. Additionally, it is not known whether cells that develop X-ray resistance also would develop resistance to other types of radiation such as heavy-ions including carbon ions (C-ion). In this study, we established X-ray resistant cancer cell lines by delivering repeated exposures to X rays, and then assessed whether the cells were resistant to carbon ions. The mouse squamous cell carcinoma cell line, NR-S1, was X irradiated six times with 10 Gy, and the X-ray resistant cancer cells named X60 and ten subclones were established. Significant X-ray resistance was induced in four of the subclones (X60, X60-H2, X60-A3 and X60-B12). The X60 cells and all of the subclones were resistant to carbon ions. The correlation analysis between radioresistance and morphological characteristics of these cells showed that X-ray (R=0.74) and C-ion (R=0.79) resistance correlated strongly with the number of heterochromatin domains. Moreover, the numbers of ?-H2AX foci remaining in irradiated X60 cells and radioresistant subclones X60-A3 and X60-H2 were lower than in the NR-S1 cells after X-ray or C-ion irradiation, indicating that X60 cells and the radioresistant subclones rapidly repaired the DNA double-strand breaks compared with NR-S1 cells. Our findings suggest that the underlying causal mechanisms of X-ray and C-ion radiation resistance may overlap, and that an increase in heterochromatin domain number may be an indicator of X-ray and C-ion resistance.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229975","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.796753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.55071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Radioresistance","weight":0.380204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance"},{"name":"Heterochromatin","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromatin"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.361876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Sunlight","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.219529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.159322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Radiation resistance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_resistance"},{"name":"H2AFX","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2AFX"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Canonical correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation"},{"name":"University of California Natural Reserve System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Natural_Reserve_System"},{"name":"SL X60","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL_X60"},{"name":"Focus (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
