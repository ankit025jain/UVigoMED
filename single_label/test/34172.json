{"id":34172,"title":"Perventricular device closure of congenital ventricular septal defects.","abstract":"Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a common congenital heart disease. Open surgical repair with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and sternotomy is the classic treatment. Percutaneous device closure is a minimally invasive alternative in treating selected VSDs, but it is limited by vascular access as well as radiation exposure especially in pediatric patients. Hybrid perventricular device closure of VSDs was designed to combine the advantages of both approaches allowing direct access to the defect without CPB and has gained wider acceptance in recent years. Under transesophageal echocardiography guidance, it could effectively close muscular, perimembranous, and even doubly committed defects. It is a safe and effective option for selected patients with congenital VSDs. In this article, we reviewed the application and results of this technique.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762039","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.632099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.547438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.392913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.199618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Transesophageal echocardiography","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transesophageal_echocardiography"}]}
