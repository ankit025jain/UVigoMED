{"id":24245,"title":"[Hidden diseases: tuberculosis in a woman with a severe mental illness].","abstract":"Patients with severe mental illness often have only limited access to health care for physical symptoms. They have difficulty in organising their thoughts and articulating their requests for medical help; in addition, they often have a reduced perception of stimuli like physical pain. There may also be a language barrier and sometimes a cultural barrier. The case that we present demonstrates that these are not separate causes but they are interrelated in a complex manner. Screening for a latent disease such as tuberculosis reduces the risk of a delayed diagnosis stemming from the patient's inability to articulate a request for medical help. The physical symptoms of patients with severe mental illness can only be reliably interpreted when there is close cooperation between physicians and psychiatrists.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446227","annotations":[{"name":"Perception","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.721977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.679206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Psychiatrist","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.196183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Interpretation (logic)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"}]}
