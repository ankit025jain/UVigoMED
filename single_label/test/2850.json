{"id":2850,"title":"[A meibomian gland massage mechanism for upper and lower eyelids based on anti-phase rolling and enveloping movement].","abstract":"During the course of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) treatment, meibomian gland massage is an effective auxiliary method. Based on an extrusion method using anti-phase massage rollers and a theory on envelope plane, a massage mechanism was proposed in this paper for the defect of the traditional mechanical assist massage structure to discharge obstruction of Meibomian gland more smoothly and to enlarge massage coverage. Meanwhile, for the case that the power of motor was significantly limited by size, an evaluation, about the input, output and loss, was carried out to initially verify the feasibility of the designed mechanism.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330603","annotations":[{"name":"Paper","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.413057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.266363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Input/output","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Meibomian gland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meibomian_gland"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Crystallographic defect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_defect"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"Envelope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Electrostatic discharge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Miller Brewing Company","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Brewing_Company"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Output","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output"}]}
