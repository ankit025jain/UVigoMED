{"id":34885,"title":"What is new in familial hypercholesterolemia?","abstract":"The purpose of this review is to describe advances in the diagnosis, cause, metabolism, risk factors for atherosclerosis, and treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is almost four-fold more frequent than previously thought and is associated with 10-fold to 13-fold risk of cardiovascular disease comparing with normolipidemics. LDL receptor (LDLR) dysfunction and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) accumulation disturb the metabolism of other lipoprotein classes, such as chylomicrons and remnants and HDL. Next-generation sequencing can improve familial hypercholesterolemia molecular diagnosis due to its better performance and lower costs than usual techniques. Despite this, roughly 40% of familial hypercholesterolemia patients do not present mutations on the LDLR, apolipoprotein B, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. Many individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia phenotype have polygenic instead of monogenic cause of their elevated LDL-C concentrations. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia show elevated burden of subclinical atherosclerosis. The intensity of atherosclerosis burden is associated with the severity of LDLR mutation rather than maternal or paternal heritability. Newer-approved and on-development medications that reduce LDL-C hold promise for preventing cardiovascular disease in familial hypercholesterolemia.Familial hypercholesterolemia is frequent and currently underdiagnosed and undertreated, but effective cascade screening programs and early and intensive LDL-C lowering can change this picture and the natural history of the disease.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699416","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"LDL receptor","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDL_receptor"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.775493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.744124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.541951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Familial hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.454784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.44856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chylomicron","weight":0.432024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chylomicron"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.370101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.279788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.195016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein B","weight":0.0561906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_B"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
