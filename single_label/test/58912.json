{"id":58912,"title":"The role of interventional radiology in reducing haemorrhage and hysterectomy following caesarean section for morbidly adherent placenta.","abstract":"To report experience of prophylactic occlusion balloon catheters (POBCs) in both internal iliac arteries before caesarean section, with or without embolization, to preserve the uterus and reduce haemorrhage.Twenty-seven women diagnosed with morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) and with suspected placenta percreta underwent POBC placement before caesarean section. The balloons were inflated immediately after delivery of the baby. The patients' case notes were reviewed retrospectively for histological grading of MAP, blood loss, transfusion, requirement of uterine artery embolization (UAE), or hysterectomy, radiation dose, and infant or maternal morbidity and mortality.MAP was confirmed histologically as percreta in 17, accreta in eight, and increta in two women. Mean blood loss was 1.92 l (range 0.5-12 l). Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) occurred in nine patients. Eight were referred for UAE, which was successful in six. Immediate peri-partum hysterectomy was performed in one patient. Three women in total required hysterectomy, two after recurrent haemorrhage after UAE. No foetal morbidity or mortality occurred. No maternal mortality occurred. There was one case of iliac artery thrombosis, which resolved with conservative therapy.POBC, with or without UAE, contributes to reduction of blood loss and preservation of the uterus in women with MAP.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880757","annotations":[{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Placenta accreta","weight":0.827477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta_accreta"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Postpartum hemorrhage","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.72666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.717296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.665675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.625688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.588611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Uterine artery embolization","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_artery_embolization"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.20029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Internal iliac artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_iliac_artery"},{"name":"Uterine artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_artery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
