{"id":40852,"title":"L-Theanine healed NSAID-induced gastric ulcer by modulating pro/antioxidant balance in gastric ulcer margin.","abstract":"L-Theanine is a unique non-protein-forming amino acid present in tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze]. In the present work, we evaluated the healing effect of L-theanine on NSAID (indomethacin)-induced gastric ulcer. Histology of the stomach tissues revealed maximum ulceration on the third day after indomethacin administration (18 mg/kg, single dose p.o.) which was accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation; protein carbonylation; Th1 cytokine synthesis, and depletion of thiol, mucin, prostaglandin (PG) E, Th2 cytokine synthesis; and total antioxidant status in mice. L-Theanine healed gastric ulcer at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. but aggravated the ulcerated condition at a higher dose of 40 mg/kg b.w. At 10 mg/kg b.w., L-theanine significantly alleviated the adverse oxidative effect of indomethacin through enhanced synthesis of PGE2 by modulation of cyclo-oxygenase-1 and 2 [COX-1 and COX-2] expression, Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, and restoration of cellular antioxidant status at the gastric ulcer margin. The present study revealed for the first time the dose-dependent biphasic effect of a natural neuroprotective agent, L-theanine, on gastric ulcer disease.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981317","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.873017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.701005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.696382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Indometacin","weight":0.524712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.448417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.335847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Tea","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Carbonylation","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonylation"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.255579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.170722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"}]}
