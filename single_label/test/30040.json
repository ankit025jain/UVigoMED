{"id":30040,"title":"Two cases of chylopericardium after aortic valve surgery.","abstract":"Chylopericardium is a rare clinical condition. It is largely idiopathic but could be iatrogenic from breached thoracic duct collaterals or secondary to thoracic duct flow obstruction. We describe 2 patients seen in a single cardiothoracic center within 6 weeks, and detail the clinicopathologic correlation of an unusual complication of cardiac surgery, as well as provide an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of postcardiotomy pericardial chylous effusion.
