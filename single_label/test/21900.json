{"id":21900,"title":"Genetic systems for studying obligate intracellular pathogens: an update.","abstract":"Rapid advancements in the genetic manipulation of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens have been made over the past two years. In this paper we attempt to summarize the work published since 2011 that documents these exciting accomplishments. Although each genus comprising this diverse group of pathogens poses unique problems, requiring modifications of established techniques and the introduction of new tools, all appear amenable to genetic analysis. Significantly, the field is moving forward from a focus on the identification and development of genetic techniques to their application in addressing crucial questions related to mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity and the requirements of obligate intracellular growth.
