{"id":29237,"title":"Association of CREB1 gene polymorphism with drug seeking behaviour in eastern Indian addicts.","abstract":"cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a major transcription factor which plays an important role in a wide array of cellular functions. CREB also has a significant function in developing substance abuse. A study was undertaken to identify the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at selective areas of CREB1 gene in heroin as well as in alcohol addicts in comparison with control population. One hundred and forty control subjects, 112 heroin and 102 alcoholics, all male and residing in Kolkata, a city in eastern India participated in the study. SNPs from several exonic regions of CREB1 gene were assessed to investigate possible associations with addiction. One SNP in exon 3, rs35349697, demonstrated a significant correlation with opioid addiction as well as with alcohol addiction. A novel SNP, also located in exon 3, was identified which showed epistatic interaction with rs35349697 to decrease susceptibility to narcotic addiction in the population. The study is the first report on the identification of a role of CREB1 gene polymorphism with addiction.
