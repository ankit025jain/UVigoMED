{"id":68784,"title":"Pre-emptive replacement of water treatment components improves responsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in maintenance haemodialysis patients: a quality improvement report.","abstract":"Hypo-responsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has been associated with increased mortality. We examined the effect of water treatment component replacement on declining ESA responsiveness in the absence of chemical or microbiological standards failure. Pre-emptive renewal of the water treatment system supplying 802 standard-flux haemodialysis patients resulted in a significant rise in haemoglobin from (mean ± SD) 12.1 ± 1.2 to 12.3 ± 1.0 g/dl (p < 0.0001), accompanied by a significant decrease in prescribed dose of darbepoetin alfa from 47.9 ± 27.3 to 44.7 ± 27.6 ?g/week (p < 0.0001). ESA responsiveness improved significantly from 0.060 ± 0.041 to 0.055 ± 0.040 ?g/kg/g · dl(-1) (p < 0.0001) and the number of patients no longer requiring ESA therapy increased threefold. These benefits were derived in the absence of haemolysis or significant changes in water quality. Renewal of water system components should be conducted even in the absence of proven microbiological and chemical failure.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496198","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.865113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Water quality","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.707668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.614744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Water treatment","weight":0.451847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment"},{"name":"European Space Agency","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.375952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.357891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.269552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Water supply network","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network"},{"name":"Greywater","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greywater"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Darbepoetin alfa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbepoetin_alfa"},{"name":"Dirasha language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirasha_language"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"802","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Preemption (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)"},{"name":"Responsiveness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsiveness"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"California's 12th State Senate district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_12th_State_Senate_district"}]}
