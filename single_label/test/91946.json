{"id":91946,"title":"Traumatic dislocation of intact mandibular condyle into middle cranial fossa.","abstract":"A 10-year-old girl presented to the Emergency Department with temporomandibular joint pain, malocclusion, and trismus after a bicycle accident.CT of the temporal bones showed displacement of the right mandibular condyle into the middle cranial fossa with small intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The condyle was reduced using closed reduction technique and the patient was placed in maxillomandibular fixation.Complete reduction of the displaced condyle with resultant normal occlusion and persistent bony defect in the temporal bone.In early follow-up assessments the patient has had complete resolution of symptoms with residual bony defect from the site of fracture in the temporal bone.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462110","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Temporal bone","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.764492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Middle cranial fossa","weight":0.614783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cranial_fossa"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.434635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.417818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Intraparenchymal hemorrhage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraparenchymal_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Trismus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trismus"},{"name":"Condyloid process","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyloid_process"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
