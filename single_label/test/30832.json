{"id":30832,"title":"Cytotoxic, hematologic and histologic effects of niobium pentoxide in Swiss mice.","abstract":"The use of metal devices in medical application is increasing but it remains incompletely understood the physiological effects of component degradation. Niobium (Nb) alloys have already been investigated in the 1980's and recent studies demonstrated the potential of Nb as an implant material. The purpose of this study was to determine cytotoxic, hematologic and histologic effects of niobium in Swiss mice. Animals were treated with a single dose of 3 % niobium oxide (Nb2O5) diluted in PBS, i.p. Cytotoxic assay, hematologic and histologic evaluation were done 3, 7 and 12 days after niobium treatment. Data have shown increased number of cells after niobium treatment, but there was no difference in cell viability. Furthermore, it was not observed hematological modification 3, 7 or 12 days after niobium treatment. Despite the fact that animals treated with niobium for 3 and 7 days showed mild degeneration in hepatocytes, mice kept alive for 12 days showed liver cells regeneration. Our results suggested that niobium cytotoxicity was not progressive because 12 days after treatment there was an evident liver regeneration. Data obtained indicated that niobium may be promising alternatives to biomedical applications.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449027","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.756125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.570683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.561195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.240035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.219212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Alloy","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Niobium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0153745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
