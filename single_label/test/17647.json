{"id":17647,"title":"Efficacy of plasma exchange in septic shock: a case report.","abstract":"The mortality rate for severe sepsis and septic shock remains high. Additionally, this life-threatening state poses serious difficulties for the treatment of patients. Unfortunately, the mechanism of sepsis is complex and not well understood. In this paper, we present the case of a 2.5-year-old female with septic shock treated with plasma exchange (PE) as a nonstandard therapy. We analysed the medical history of disease, including patient data, physical examination, laboratory tests and treatment. Unexpectedly, we achieved clinical improvement after the first PE. During PE, the dose of catecholamine was reduced. In addition, the level of C-reactive protein seemed to be a better predictor of the efficacy of PE in septic shock compared to procalcitonin. We conclude that PE may improve the survival rate for patients with septic shock. These data could be useful in the search and introduction of new or alternative methods of treatment for critically ill children.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858968","annotations":[{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.817307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.784779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.698987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.681021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.515256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.323833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Physical education","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
