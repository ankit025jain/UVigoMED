{"id":62711,"title":"Donor-derived natural killer cells infused after human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation: a dose-escalation study.","abstract":"The doses of donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells that can be given safely after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remain to be defined. Forty-one patients (ages 17 to 75 years) with hematologic malignancy underwent HLA-haploidentical HCT after reduced-intensity conditioning containing busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. Cell donors (ages 7 to 62 years) underwent growth factor-mobilized leukapheresis for 3 to 4 days. Cells collected on the first 2 to 3 days were used for HCT, whereas those collected on the last day were CD3-depleted and cultured into NK cells using human interleukins-15 and -21. These NK cells were then infused into patients twice at 2 and 3 weeks after HCT at an escalating doses of .2 × 10(8) cells/kg of body weight (3 patients), .5 × 10(8) cells/kg (3 patients), 1.0 × 10(8) cells/kg (8 patients), and ? 1.0 × 10(8) cells/kg or available cells (27 patients). At all dose levels, no acute toxicity was observed after NK cell infusion. After HLA-haploidentical HCT and subsequent donor NK cell infusion, when referenced to 31 historical patients who had undergone HLA-haploidentical HCT after the same conditioning regimen but without high-dose NK cell infusion, there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidences of major HCT outcomes, including engraftment (absolute neutrophil count ? 500/?L, 85% versus 87%), grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD, 17% versus 16%), moderate to severe chronic GVHD (15% versus 10%), and transplantation-related mortality (27% versus 19%). There was, however, a significant reduction in leukemia progression (74% to 46%), with post-transplantation NK cell infusion being an independent predictor for less leukemia progression (hazard ratio, .527). Our findings showed that, when given 2 to 3 weeks after HLA-haploidentical HCT, donor-derived NK cells were well tolerated at a median total dose of 2.0 × 10(8) cells/kg. In addition, they may decrease post-transplantation progression of acute leukemia.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525278","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Leukapheresis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukapheresis"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.850087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Busulfan","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busulfan"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.815563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Fludarabine","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.730699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.630593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.622707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.524047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.431956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.428706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.425213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Absolute neutrophil count","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_neutrophil_count"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
