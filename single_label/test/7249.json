{"id":7249,"title":"Immunisation with bacterial expressed VP2 and VP5 of bluetongue virus (BTV) protect ?/? interferon-receptor knock-out (IFNAR(-/-)) mice from homologous lethal challenge.","abstract":"BTV-4 structural proteins VP2 (as two domains: VP2D1 and VP2D2), VP5 (lacking the first 100 amino acids: VP5?1-100) and full-length VP7, expressed in bacteria as soluble glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion-proteins, were used to immunise Balb/c and ?/? interferon receptor knock-out (IFNAR(-/-)) mice. Neutralising antibody (NAbs) titres (expressed as log10 of the reciprocal of the last dilution of mouse serum which reduced plaque number by ?50%) induced by the VP2 domains ranged from 1.806 to 2.408 in Balb/c and IFNAR(-/-) mice. The immunised IFNAR(-/-) mice challenged with a homologous live BTV-4 survived and failed to develop signs of infection (ocular discharge and apathy). Although subsequent attempts to isolate virus were unsuccessful (possibly reflecting presence of neutralising antibodies), a transient/low level viraemia was detected by real time RT-PCR. In contrast, mice immunised with the two VP2 domains with or without VP5?1-100 and VP7, then challenged with the heterologous serotype, BTV-8, all died by day 7 post-infection. We conclude that immunisation with bacterially-expressed VP2 domains can induce strong serotype-specific NAb responses. Bacterial expression could represent a cost effective and risk-free alternative to the use of live or inactivated vaccines, particularly if viruses prove to be difficult to propagate in cell culture (like BTV-25). A vaccine based on bacterially expressed VP2 and VP5 of BTV is also DIVA-compatible.
