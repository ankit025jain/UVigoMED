{"id":47006,"title":"[Diverticular bleeding. Diagnostics, non-surgical treatment, indications for surgery].","abstract":"Diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of acute severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have not been standardized.Development of an evidence-based management algorithm.A systematic search of the literature (PubMed 1998-2013) was carried out and a review with consideration of current guidelines is given.The lifetime risk of clinically relevant bleeding is estimated to be 5?% in persons with colonic diverticula. Patients with clinically suspected diverticular hemorrhage should be admitted to hospital. Diverticular bleeding will cease spontaneously in around 70-90?% of the cases. In patients with severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, defined as instability of the circulation, persistent bleeding after 24 h, drop of the hemoglobin level to ??2 g/dl or the necessity for transfusion, endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract within the first 12-24 h is recommended. In patients with active diverticular bleeding or signs of recent hemorrhage (e.g. visible vessel or adherent clot) endoscopic therapy is strongly recommended because it significantly decreases the rate of early and late rebleeding. Angiography with superselective embolization is a therapeutic option in patients where endoscopy failed. Surgery should be considered in patients with ongoing bleeding and failure of interventional treatment and in patients who suffered from recurrent severe diverticular bleeding.Diverticulosis coli remains the most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopy is recommended as first-line diagnostic and therapeutic approach. In the vast majority of patients diverticular hemorrhage can be readily managed either conventionally or by interventional therapy.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610007","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.827617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diverticulum","weight":0.691716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulum"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.68385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.585964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.501002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Lower gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.465373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.464349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.441692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Diverticulosis","weight":0.355662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulosis"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
