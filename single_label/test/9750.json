{"id":9750,"title":"A retrospective study comparing the outcome of horses undergoing small intestinal resection and anastomosis with a single layer (Lembert) or double layer (simple continuous and Cushing) technique.","abstract":"To (1) compare postoperative complications and survival in horses after small intestinal resection and anastomosis using 2 anastomosis techniques (single layer Lembert; double layer simple continuous oversewn with Cushing), and (2) to compare outcome by anastomosis type (jejunoileostomy; jejunojejunostomy).Retrospective case series.Horses (n = 53).Medical records (July 2006-July 2010) of all horses that had small intestinal resection and anastomosis. Horses were divided into groups based on technique and type of anastomosis. Comparisons of pre- and intraoperative findings (disease severity), postoperative complications, and survival rates were made between groups.There were no differences in disease severity, postoperative complications, or survival between single layer (n = 23) or double layer (n = 31) anastomoses. There were no differences in disease severity or survival between jejunoileostomy (n = 16) or jejunojejunostomy (n = 38). There was a higher incidence of postoperative colic in hospital after jejunoileostomy (13/16) compared with jejunojejunostomy (18/38) (P = .0127).Postoperative complications and survival are comparable between horses undergoing single layer and double layer small intestinal end-to-end anastomoses. With the exception of increased postoperative colic in the hospital, postoperative complications and survival after jejunoileostomy and jejunojejunostomy are also comparable.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689880","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.567093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.549112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.327476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.276157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.122673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Baby colic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_colic"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"1838","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1838"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"1316","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1316"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Harvey Williams Cushing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Williams_Cushing"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
