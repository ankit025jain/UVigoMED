{"id":61539,"title":"Survival improvement of poor-prognosis AML/MDS patients by maintenance treatment with low-dose chemotherapy and differentiating agents.","abstract":"We evaluated a maintenance, post-remission treatment with low-dose chemotherapy plus differentiating agents on poor-prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients ineligible to allografting. Patients had either age over 60 and/or secondary AML, therapy-related AML, previous relapse, high-risk MDS. Forty-five patients received the maintenance therapy based on two alternated schedules: (a) 6-thioguanine + 13-cis retinoic acid + dihydroxylated vitamin D3 and (b) low-dose cytarabine + 6-mercaptopurine + all-trans retinoic acid + dihydroxylated vitamin D3. We compared their outcome, at a median follow-up of 52 months, to that of a matched population of 49 patients who stopped treatments after consolidation. Maintenance group had a lower relapse incidence (70.3 vs. 86.4 % at 5 years p = 0.007) and a longer disease-free survival (median 21.2 vs. 8.7 months, p = 0.017). The relapse reduction improved overall survival: median 40.4 months (35.9 % at 5 years) for maintenance group vs. 15.8 (14.2 % at 5 years) for controls (p = 0.005). At multivariate Cox analysis, both cytogenetic and maintenance therapies resulted independent outcome predictors for overall survival. Maintenance treatment also reduced minimal residual disease (detected by WT1 and CBF?-MYH11) in five of eight evaluable patients. The present results suggest that our strategy of maintenance therapy might improve the outcome of poor-risk AML/MDS patients.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705888","annotations":[{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.866178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Retinoic acid","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Mercaptopurine","weight":0.800655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptopurine"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.794251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.731494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.668485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tioguanine","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioguanine"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.624215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.566177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0657051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"WT1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WT1"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Cis-trans isomerism","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis-trans_isomerism"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Ironman 70.3","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_70.3"}]}
