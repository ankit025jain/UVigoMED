{"id":4553,"title":"The effect of aging on pulmonary function: implications for monitoring and support of the surgical and trauma patient.","abstract":"Age-related anatomic, physiologic, and immunologic changes to the pulmonary system, as well as a high prevalence of chronic pulmonary diseases, puts the geriatric patient at an especially high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. Successful perioperative respiratory care of the geriatric patient relies on careful risk assessment and optimization of pulmonary function and support. The success of such efforts aimed at preventing and/or mitigating pulmonary complications in the geriatric patient depends on a thorough, individualized, yet standardized and evidence-based approach to the care of every patient.
