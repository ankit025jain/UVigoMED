{"id":23095,"title":"[Fluoroquinolone resistance determining region mutation in Streptococcus pneumonia isolates].","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between different fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the mutations of target genes.A total of 232 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were collected from 12 teaching hospitals at 9 cities between June and December 2010. The antibacterial activities of 16 antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution method. The ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin MIC ? 1 mg/L isolates were selected to detect the mutations in QRDR (parC, parE, and gyrA genes) through PCR combined sequencing.The susceptible rates of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were 53.9% (125/232) , 98.7% (229/232) , 98.7% (229/232) .Forty-three strains were randomly selected to be analyzed, including 19 levofloxacin MIC ? 2 mg/L strains and 24 levofloxacin MIC = 1 mg/L strains. The MIC of levofloxacin were 1-2 mg/L, ciprofloxacin were 2 mg/L and moxifloxacin were 0.125-0.250 mg/L when a single mutation in parE occurred. The MIC of levofloxacin were 2 mg/L, ciprofloxacin were 4 mg/L and moxifloxacin were 0.25 mg/L or 0.50 mg/L when mutations in both parE and parC occurred. The MIC of levofloxacin were 16 mg/L, ciprofloxacin were ? 16 mg/L and moxifloxacin were 4 mg/L when mutations in both parE and gyrA occurred.The single mutation in parE/parC is associated with low level levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin resistance, while double mutations in both parC/parE and gyrA are associated with moxifloxacin resistance.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503427","annotations":[{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Levofloxacin","weight":0.83303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.636532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.535281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.531511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Moxifloxacin","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxifloxacin"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.317087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.27286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1250","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1250"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"}]}
