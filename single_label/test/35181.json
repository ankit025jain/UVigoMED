{"id":35181,"title":"Safety and efficacy using a detachable tip microcatheter in the embolization of pediatric arteriovenous malformations.","abstract":"The treatment of deep-seeded pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a challenging task. We describe our experience using a new detachable tip microcatheter in the embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations, pial arteriovenous fistulas, and vein of Galen malformations. We describe the safety and efficacy using a new detachable tip microcatheter in the treatment of pediatric deep brain arteriovenous malformations, pial malformations, and vein of Galen malformations.During a period of 9 months from March 2013 through January 2014, 11 pediatric patients in 14 procedures with 27 total injections were selected for treatment with a detachable tip under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compassionate use exemption and were admitted to our department for treatment of their brain AVM using a liquid embolic agent and a detachable tip microcatheter. The ages of the patients ranged from 3 months to 18 years old.Of the 27 total injections done, the tip detached in seven cases. For the 16 n-BCA injections, the tip detached six times (37.5 %), and for the 11 Onyx injections, the tip detached one time (9 %). There were no cases of premature microcatheter detachment during normal vessel navigation.The introduction of these detachable tip microcatheters allows for a safe and relaxed injection that permits a true circumferential occlusion, and may further permit filling a larger amount of angioarchitecture without the risk of distal migration, or vessel damage during the usual rapid removal of non detachable micocatheters.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671157","annotations":[{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.892578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Galen","weight":0.640241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.389132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.366471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.36234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Pia mater","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_mater"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.187916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Expanded access","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_access"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Detachable chairlift","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachable_chairlift"},{"name":"Single-family detached home","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
