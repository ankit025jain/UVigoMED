{"id":87938,"title":"The role of imaging in diagnosing diseases of the distal radioulnar joint, triangular fibrocartilage complex, and distal ulna.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to review the anatomy, biomechanics, and multimodality imaging findings of common and uncommon distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), triangular fibrocartilage complex, and distal ulna abnormalities.The DRUJ is a common site for acute and chronic injuries and is frequently imaged to evaluate chronic wrist pain, forearm dysfunction, and traumatic forearm injury. Given the complex anatomy of the wrist, the radiologist plays a vital role in the diagnosis of wrist pain and dysfunction.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951208","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.58667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.521733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.469872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ulna","weight":0.445674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.0989523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Fibrocartilage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrocartilage"},{"name":"Distal radioulnar articulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radioulnar_articulation"},{"name":"Triangular fibrocartilage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_fibrocartilage"},{"name":"Radioulnar joint","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioulnar_joint"}]}
