{"id":92229,"title":"Treatment of recent trochanteric fracture in adults.","abstract":"Recent trochanteric fracture is frequent in adults, and mainly affects elderly patients who risk loss of independence. Treatment is surgical, of various sorts. Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with intra- or extra-medullary implants is the most frequent attitude in these fractures, which usually heal easily. In elderly patients, arthroplasty is an alternative of choice for some authors. These different treatment modalities are presented, focusing on technical details. Possible technical difficulties and the means of dealing with them are considered. Published results help in choosing the treatment most suitable for a particular type of fracture in a particular patient.
