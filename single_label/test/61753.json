{"id":61753,"title":"[The role of iron metabolism in myelodysplastic syndromes].","abstract":"Patients affected by myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with transfusion-dependent anemia are destined to develop iron overload. The main diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of transfusional iron overload are serum ferritin and transfusion history. In MDS several studies showed that iron overload is an independent negative prognostic factor. Deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, has shown efficacy and acceptable tolerability in MDS setting, and has also been shown to improve peripheral cytopenia in 10-20% of patients. Iron chelation therapy is recommended, after the transfusion of 20 red cell units, in low-risk MDS patients, and also in high-risk patients responding to treatment of the disease and/or candidates to receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
