{"id":67075,"title":"[Diseases of solitary kidney: the history and evolution of scientific issues].","abstract":"The lecture is devoted to one of the most important problems of modern urology, which has a long scientific history--the diseases of solitary kidney after nephrectomy. Fundamental theory of solitary kidney was laid in the early XX century, during which it was significantly enriched by fundamental provisions preserving their practical significance in the present time. In the domestic literature of the last decade, however, the problem of diseases of solitary kidney is undeservedly forgotten and slightly developed. At the same time, recent data suggest a certain theoretical and practical conflict in this section of urology: on the one hand, the incidence of diseases of solitary kidney in the last 50 years has increased by at least a 2 times; on the other--an effective conservative treatments of diseases of solitary kidney at different stages of kidney failure have not yet implemented in clinical practice, except hemodialysis and renal transplantation used in the terminal stages of chronic renal failure. Methods of primary and secondary prevention of diseases of solitary kidney are not developed at all. The history and evolution of problems of diseases of solitary kidney is a good example of fact that despite available data and accumulation of new scientific evidence of the close relationship between local and systemic factors in the pathogenesis of these diseases, their new rethinking in the framework of interdisciplinary interactions for the optimization of methods of clinical management of this specific group of patients as well as for the development of new effective methods for early diagnosis, treatment and prevention are required.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649775","annotations":[{"name":"Urology","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.684591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.320466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.30722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.270315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"History","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.253562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Lecture","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecture"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.117565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.104316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1960s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Theory of everything","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"War","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
