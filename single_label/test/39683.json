{"id":39683,"title":"The gap between scientific evidence and clinical practice: 5-aminosalicylates are frequently used for the treatment of Crohn's disease.","abstract":"There is uncertain evidence of effectiveness of 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) to induce and maintain response and remission of active Crohn's disease (CD), and weak evidence to support their use in post-operative CD.To assess the frequency and determinants of 5-ASA use in CD patients and to evaluate the physicians' perception of clinical response and side effects to 5-ASA.Data from the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort, which collects data since 2006 on a large sample of IBD patients, were analysed. Information from questionnaires regarding utilisation of treatments and perception of response to 5-ASA were evaluated. Logistic regression modelling was performed to identify factors associated with 5-ASA use.Of 1420 CD patients, 835 (59%) were ever treated with 5-ASA from diagnosis to latest follow-up. Disease duration >10 years and colonic location were both significantly associated with 5-ASA use. 5-ASA treatment was judged to be successful in 46% (378/825) of treatment episodes (physician global assessment). Side effects prompting stop of therapy were found in 12% (98/825) episodes in which 5-ASA had been stopped.5-Aminosalicylates were frequently prescribed in patients with Crohn's disease in the Swiss IBD cohort. This observation stands in contrast to the scientific evidence demonstrating a very limited role of 5-ASA compounds in the treatment of Crohn's disease.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146487","annotations":[{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.547774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.470979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.462222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.397409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.371966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.331718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.310879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.265536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.139755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"}]}
