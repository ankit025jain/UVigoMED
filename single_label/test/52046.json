{"id":52046,"title":"Antecedent hypoglycaemia does not diminish the glycaemia-increasing effect and glucoregulatory responses of a 10 s sprint in people with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"A 10 s sprint has been reported to provide a means to prevent acute post-exercise hypoglycaemia in young adults with type 1 diabetes because of its glycaemia-raising effect, but it is unclear whether this effect is impaired by antecedent hypoglycaemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether antecedent hypoglycaemia impairs the glycaemia-raising effect of a 10 s sprint in individuals with type 1 diabetes.Eight individuals underwent a hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic or hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp on two separate mornings. Thereafter, the participants underwent a basal insulin-euglycaemic clamp before performing a 10 s sprint on a cycle ergometer. The levels of blood glucose and glucoregulatory hormones and rates of glucose appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) were compared between conditions.During the morning clamps, blood glucose levels were significantly different between conditions of hypoglycaemia (2.8?±?0.1 mmol/l) and euglycaemia (5.4?±?0.2 mmol/l; p?<?0.001). Mean glycaemia prior to sprinting was similar (5.6?±?0.4 and 5.5?±?0.3 mmol/l for hypoglycaemic and euglycaemic conditions, respectively; p?=?0.83). In response to the afternoon sprint, the pattern of increase in blood glucose levels did not differ between conditions, reaching similar maximal levels 45 min after exercise (6.5?±?0.4 and 6.6?±?0.3 mmol/l, respectively; p?=?0.43). The early post-exercise patterns in glucose Ra and Rd and increases in plasma adrenaline (epinephrine), growth hormone and cortisol levels did not differ between conditions.Hypoglycaemia in the morning does not diminish the glycaemia-raising effect of an afternoon 10 s sprint in young adults with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that sprinting is a useful strategy for opposing hypoglycaemia, regardless of prior hypoglycaemia.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632737","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.890526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.636555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Stationary bicycle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_bicycle"},{"name":"Sprint (running)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Clamp (tool)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamp_(tool)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 10","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_10"},{"name":"Ra","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
