{"id":89256,"title":"[The formation of the School of Military Neurosurgery of the Military Medical Academy].","abstract":"The article is devoted to stages of formation of the school of military neurosurgery. Famous pioneers of this school were Vsevolod Galkin and Boris Samotokin. Their scientific works were based on personal experience of treatment for the battle scull and brain injuries during the Great Patriotic War. The main aim of the activity of the talented researcher Vitally Khilko was to develop microneurosurgery, neuroimmunology and fundamental researchers of cerebral blood flow pathology. Boris Gaidar and Valeriy Parfyonov reorganized the echelon neurosurgical care system in a relatively short time. This reorganization formed the basis of the modem principles of specialized neurosurgical care in armed conflicts. At the present time department of neurosurgery is the leading methodological and clinical center of military neurosurgery in Russia.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738278","annotations":[{"name":"Russia","weight":0.783055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.444062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"War","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"School","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Eastern Front (World War II)","weight":0.115088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.086037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Battle","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle"},{"name":"Researcher","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Researcher"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Science in medieval Islam","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_medieval_Islam"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Soviet military academies","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_military_academies"},{"name":"Cerebral blood flow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_blood_flow"},{"name":"Neuroimmunology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimmunology"},{"name":"Modem","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Yegor Gaidar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yegor_Gaidar"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Sculling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculling"},{"name":"Boris (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_(band)"},{"name":"Military Medical Academy (Serbia)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medical_Academy_(Serbia)"},{"name":"Formation (military)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(military)"},{"name":"French invasion of Russia","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Settler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler"},{"name":"Religious experience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_experience"}]}
