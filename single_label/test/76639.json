{"id":76639,"title":"Coping style as a mediator between attachment and mental and physical health in patients suffering from morbid obesity.","abstract":"The presence of mental health problems and limitations in physical functioning is high in patients suffering from morbid obesity. The purpose of the current study was to examine the mediating role of coping style in the relationship between attachment representations and mental health and physical functioning in a morbidly obese population.A total of 299 morbidly obese patients who were referred to the Slotervaart bariatric surgery unit in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, completed self-report questionnaires assessing adult attachment style (Experiences in Close Relationship-Revised Questionnaire), coping style (Utrecht Coping List), and patients physical functioning and mental health (Short Form-36).Attachment anxiety (beta = -.490, p < .001) and attachment avoidance (3 = -.387, p < .001) were both found to be related to mental health. In addition, attachment anxiety was also found to be related to physical functioning (beta = - .188,p < .001). Coping style partly mediated these associations.Findings suggest that coping mediates the association between attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on the one hand and mental health and physical functioning in patients with morbid obesity on the other hand.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956919","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.682679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.666165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.418291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.401471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Amsterdam","weight":0.40099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.281518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Utrecht","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht"},{"name":"Attachment in adults","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults"},{"name":"Slotervaart","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slotervaart"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Representation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory"},{"name":"Military unit","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0158637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Experience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
