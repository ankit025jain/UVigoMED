{"id":80110,"title":"[Establishment of malaria early warning system in Jiangsu Province III effect of automatic early warning information system on the response of malaria elimination].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of automatic early warning information system on the response of malaria elimination in Jiangsu Province through the operation of the national automatic early warning system of infectious diseases.The malaria early warning information was collected from the automatic early warning information subsystem in the national information system for diseases control and prevention. Malaria early warning signals were analyzed from September 1 to December 31, 2012. The statistical analysis was conducted for the completion rates of case investigation within 3 days before and after the application of malaria early warning information system.Jiangsu Province received 85 mobile phone short messages (SMS) of malaria case from early warning system from September 1 to December 31, 2012. After judgments, 23 cases were deleted including 8 repeated cases and 15 cases that were excluded through the microscopy examination and epidemiological investigation by the confirmation of county CDC. From July to December in 2012, the monthly completion rates of case investigation within 3 days were 55.56%, 78.57%, 90.00%, 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively. The completion rates of case investigation within 3 days in July, August, September and October were significantly different by chi2 test ( chi2 = 10.66, P < 0.05). The completion rates of foci investigation and action within 7 days in Jiangsu Province were all 100% from July to December in 2012.The completion rates of case investigation within 3 days are associated with SMS from the early warning system. The malaria warning system from the national infectious diseases can effectively improve the response to malaria cases for primary CDC. It also plays an important role for the timely confirmation and diagnosis of malaria cases.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800561","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.790201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.698353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.51043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"SMS","weight":0.430408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.314254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.224274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.128079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"System","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Province 3 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_3_of_the_Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Church of England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"September 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Warning system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_system"},{"name":"Early warning radar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_warning_radar"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Judgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Focus (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)"},{"name":"Aposematism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
