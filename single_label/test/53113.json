{"id":53113,"title":"\"Geyser\" leakage on fluorescein angiography.","abstract":"An 82-year-old patient with diabetes was followed up due to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema in the right eye. Visual acuity was 6/36. Focal macular laser was conducted (A). Three years later, the patient presented with blurry vision in the right eye. Visual acuity was 3/60. Vitreous hemorrhage was observed (B), and neovascularization of the disc was suspected (C). Fluorescein angiography (D, mid venous phase; E-F, recirculation phase) confirmed neovascularization of the disc and depicted a striking vertical leakage. Panretinal photocoagulation was started. Possible explanations for the \"geyser\" leakage may be either a partial posterior vitreous detachment allowing the fluorescein to track upwards but not elsewhere or a pocket of syneretic vitreous allowing the fluorescein passage in which to diffuse, much like the passage the blood would have taken.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548789","annotations":[{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Posterior vitreous detachment","weight":0.869607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_vitreous_detachment"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.773426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.706967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.651618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.607706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.487785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.424244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Blurred vision","weight":0.383118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
