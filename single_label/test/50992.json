{"id":50992,"title":"Residual dysglycemia when at target HbA(1c) of 7% (53mmol/mol) in persons with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"To understand the composition of the residual dysglycemia when HbA1c is between 6.5% (48mmol/mol) and 7% (53mmol/mol), representing the definition of diabetes and the recommended treatment goal, respectively.One hundred persons with type 2 diabetes and a HbA1c<7% (53mmol/mol), treated with diet alone and/or oral hypoglycemic agents underwent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and were further divided into two subgroups 1 (n=50) and 2 (n=50) according to whether the HbA1c was <6.5% (48mmol/mol) or 6.5-6.9% (48-52mmol/mol), respectively. A similar analysis was performed in those on diet alone: subgroups A (n=34, HbA1c<6.5%, 48mmol/mol) and B (n=10, HbA1c 6.5-6.9%, 48-52mmol/mol). The residual dysglycemia determined from the CGM was assessed using glucose exposures defined as areas under curves (AUCs) and mean glucose values.Averaged 2-h postprandial glucose value (averaged PPG, mmol/L, mean±SD) and postprandial glucose exposure (AUCpp, mean±SD, mmol·L(-1)·h) were significantly higher in subgroup 2 (mean HbA1c=6.7%, 50mmol/mol) than in subgroup 1 (mean HbA1c=6.0%, 42mmol/mol): averaged PPG=8.1±1.3 versus 7.3±1.3mmol/L (p<0.002); AUCpp=23.5±8.6 versus 16.2±8.6 (p<0.0001). The percentages of persons with averaged PPG?7.8mmol/L were 52% and 24% (p<0.01) in subgroups 2 and 1, respectively. Similar results were observed in those (subgroups A and B) who were on diet alone.The residual dysglycemia in type 2 diabetes with HbA1c between 6.5 and 6.9% (48-52mmol/mol) inclusive is mainly due to remnant abnormal postprandial glucose excursions. Consequently, HbA1c<6.5% (48mmol/mol) is an achievable goal with therapeutic measures aimed at reducing postmeal glucose when the HbA1c is at 7% (53mmol/mol).","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735710","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.790269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.661831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.620804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.548198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.436844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"C (musical note)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(musical_note)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Match play","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
