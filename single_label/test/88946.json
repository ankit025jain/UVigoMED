{"id":88946,"title":"Fatal injury caused by low-energy trauma - a 10-year rural cohort.","abstract":"Death after injury with low energy has gained increasing focus lately, and seems to constitute a significant amount of trauma-related death. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of deaths from low-energy trauma in a rural Norwegian cohort.All deaths from external causes in Finnmark County, Norway, from 1995 to 2004 were identified retrospectively through the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Deaths caused by hanging, drowning, suffocation, poisoning, and electrocution were excluded. Trauma was categorised as high energy or low energy based on mechanism of injury. All low-energy trauma deaths were then reviewed.There were 262 cases of trauma death during the period. Low-energy trauma counted for 43% of the trauma deaths, with an annual crude death rate of 13 per 100,000 inhabitants. Low falls accounted for 99% of the injuries. Fractures were sustained in 89% of cases and head injuries in 11%. Ninety per cent of patients had pre-existing medical conditions, and the median age was 82 years. Death was caused by a medical condition in 85% of cases. Fifty-two per cent of the patients died after discharge from the hospital.In this cohort, low-energy trauma was a significant contributor to trauma related death, especially among elderly and patients with pre-existing medical conditions.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773521","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.832248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Drowning","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.701117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.684436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Electric shock","weight":0.492902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.422509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Hanging","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Finnmark","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnmark"},{"name":"Particle physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
