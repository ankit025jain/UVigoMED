{"id":21390,"title":"[Molecular-genetic characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from patients with tuberculous spondylitis].","abstract":"Molecular-genetic characteristic of M. tuberculosis strains isolated from operation material of patients with tuberculous spondylitis.107 strains of M. tuberculosis isolated in 2007 - 2011 from patients with spine tuberculosis were studied by methods of spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR by 12 and 24 loci.Strains of genetic family Beijing dominated (n = 80), 78% of those had multiple drug resistance (MDR). Strains of genetic families T, H3 (Ural), LAM, Manu, H4 and S were also detected. Differentiating of 80 strains of Beijing genotype by MIRU-VNTR method by 24 loci revealed 24 variants (HGI = 0.83) including 7 clusters, the largest of those (100-32) included 23 strains (87% MDR).The leading role of Beijing genotype M. tuberculosis strains in development of tuberculous spondylitis with multiple drug resistance of the causative agent is shown.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605650","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.932498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.634476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.619996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.508618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Pott disease","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pott_disease"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.362412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.297784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.216162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Spondylitis","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylitis"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.074314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Croatian Civic Initiative","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Civic_Initiative"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Inflorescence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Manu (Hinduism)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_(Hinduism)"},{"name":"Ural Mountains","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
