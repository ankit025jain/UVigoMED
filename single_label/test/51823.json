{"id":51823,"title":"Insulin resistance as a risk factor for new-onset diabetes after kidney transplantation.","abstract":"New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a serious and common complication after kidney transplantation. Insulin resistance, together with ?-cell dysfunction, plays an essential role in the development of diabetes. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), which is calculated as [fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) Ã— fasting insulin (mU/L)]/22.5, is widely used as an index of insulin resistance. However, the correlation between pretransplant HOMA-IR and the development of NODAT has not been fully established.We performed a retrospective study of 44 nondiabetic patients who underwent living donor kidney transplantation in our hospital from July 2006 to October 2009. We compared the HOMA-IR and demographic variables of patients who developed NODAT with those who did not.Five patients (11.4%) developed NODAT within 3 years after transplantation. There were no differences in demographic variables between patients who developed NODAT and those who did not. Logistic regression analysis revealed that HOMA-IR was a predictive factor of NODAT (odds ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.11-9.59; P < .05).Our results indicate that high HOMA-IR might be an important predictive factor for NODAT. These findings underline the importance of routine pretransplant measurements of fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin for evaluating HOMA-IR.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656006","annotations":[{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.92372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.788238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.663701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.550591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.547689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.313385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.238056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.13879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0813771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
