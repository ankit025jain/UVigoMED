{"id":42353,"title":"Peginterferon ?-2a and rivabirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.","abstract":"Peginterferon ?-2a with ribavirin produces significantly higher sustained virological response (SVR) in comparison to conventional interferon monotherapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of peginterferon ?-2a plus ribavirin combination in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C among Bangladeshi patients. A total of 64 patients were randomly selected in this study and were assigned for treatment with peginterferon ?-2a 180?g once weekly plus ribavirin daily for 24 weeks in case of genotypes 2 and 3 infections and 48 weeks in case of genotypes 1 and 4 infections. Ribavirin was given 800mg in divided doses in case of genotypes 2 and 3 infections and 1000mg-1200 mg in case of genotypes 1 and 4 infections according to body weight daily(1000 mg in divided doses if body weight <75kg and 1200mg in divided doses if body weight >75kg). Efficacy was assessed by measurements of serum HCV-RNA and serum ALT. A higher proportion of patients (71.87%) who received peginterferon ?-2a plus ribavirin had a sustained virological response. It is observed that genotype 3 (a and b) patients showed poor response (SVR-47.05%), where as genotypes 1(a,b), 3 and 4 mixed, 2b and 4 infections showed response rate of 100%. So it can be concluded that once weekly peginterferon ?-2a plus daily ribavirin is effective in chronic HCV infection in Bangladesh and overall response rate is similar to that reported in other studies.
