{"id":77106,"title":"A new full-field digital mammography system with and without the use of an advanced post-processing algorithm: comparison of image quality and diagnostic performance.","abstract":"To compare new full-field digital mammography (FFDM) with and without use of an advanced post-processing algorithm to improve image quality, lesion detection, diagnostic performance, and priority rank.During a 22-month period, we prospectively enrolled 100 cases of specimen FFDM mammography (BrestigeÂ®), which was performed alone or in combination with a post-processing algorithm developed by the manufacturer: group A (SMA), specimen mammography without application of \"Mammogram enhancement ver. 2.0\"; group B (SMB), specimen mammography with application of \"Mammogram enhancement ver. 2.0\". Two sets of specimen mammographies were randomly reviewed by five experienced radiologists. Image quality, lesion detection, diagnostic performance, and priority rank with regard to image preference were evaluated.Three aspects of image quality (overall quality, contrast, and noise) of the SMB were significantly superior to those of SMA (p < 0.05). SMB was significantly superior to SMA for visualizing calcifications (p < 0.05). Diagnostic performance, as evaluated by cancer score, was similar between SMA and SMB. SMB was preferred to SMA by four of the five reviewers.The post-processing algorithm may improve image quality with better image preference in FFDM than without use of the software.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843234","annotations":[{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.537478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.510689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.462149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.403229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.400141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.325461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Digital mammography","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mammography"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Server Message Block","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Imaging science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_science"},{"name":"Metastatic calcification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_calcification"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Visualization (computer graphics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
