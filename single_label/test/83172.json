{"id":83172,"title":"The use of platelet-rich plasma gel in patients with mixed tumour undergoing superficial parotidectomy: a randomized study.","abstract":"Salivary gland tumors are mostly benign tumors. Whether a more conservative surgical approach at greater risk of recurrence, or a more radical intervention with an increased risk of facial paralysis is warranted is still under discussion. Our study addresses the opportunity for improving surgical outcome by employing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel at the surgical site.Twenty consecutive patients undergoing superficial parotidectomy were randomized and assigned to two groups, one with and one without PRP gel. Many parameters were evaluated after surgery and during follow-up, such as the duration of hospitalization, facial nerve deficit, onset of Frey's syndrome, relapse, cosmetic results, presence of keloid or scar depressions, behavior of several facial muscles.Our explorative analysis suggests a positive effect of PRP on surgical outcome in patients undergoing parotidectomy, whereas no negative effects were detected.This work suggests that administration of PRP in patients undergoing parotidectomy is beneficial.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24425846","annotations":[{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.729552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.601503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.581574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.555478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.536861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.406857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.332177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.134477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Facial nerve paralysis","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve_paralysis"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Facial muscles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_muscles"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"House Frey","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Frey"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
