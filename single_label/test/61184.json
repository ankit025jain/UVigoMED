{"id":61184,"title":"Bendamustine-based therapy as first-line treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"Recently, bendamustine has become an important agent in the treatment for patients with lymphoid malignancies. Although the drug has received approval for second-line therapy in indolent lymphoma, a growing body of evidence suggests its efficacy and safety in first-line use. The results of randomised and observational studies with bendamustine as front-line therapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with emphasis on efficacy and toxicity are presented. Furthermore, completed and ongoing clinical trials evaluating upfront bendamustine effectiveness in combination with other agents are discussed. The review refers mainly to indolent lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and aggressive lymphoma, as the most commonly diagnosed NHL types. Finally, we elaborated on the safety profile of bendamustine and the perspectives of using the drug as a first-line therapy.
