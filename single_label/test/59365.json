{"id":59365,"title":"L-selectin ligands expression in human fallopian tube epithelia of tubal pregnancies.","abstract":"The objective of the study was to evaluate the expression of L-selectin ligands in tubal epithelia during tubal ectopic pregnancy. Sixteen fallopian tube samples from ectopic pregnancies and four normal control fallopian tubes from women undergoing sterilization were obtained for the study. Oviduct tissues from ectopic pregnancies were separated into implantation sites and matched nonimplantation sites. Expression of L-selectin ligands was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against HECA-452 and MECA-79 and by real-time PCR. Immunoreactivity levels against HECA-452 and MECA-79 were significantly higher at the implantation site than at the paired nonimplantation site or at the normal oviducts. Moreover, compared with MECA-79 staining, stronger HECA-452 staining was observed in the implantation and nonimplantation groups. HECA-452 histologic scores at implantation sites correlated with serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels. Increased expression of L-selectin ligands may be involved in the implantation process in tubal pregnancy.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829027","annotations":[{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sterilization (medicine)","weight":0.597689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oviduct","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviduct"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.484022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.070898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
