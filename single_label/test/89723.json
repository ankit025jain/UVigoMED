{"id":89723,"title":"[Chronic ankle joint instability: in unrecognized distal rupture of the syndosmosis and malunion of the distal fibula].","abstract":"It is often difficult in the acute phase to diagnose a lesion of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. If this lesion is overlooked, the patient will develop an incongruity of the upper ankle joint with a pathological external rotation of the talus. The risk of a possible premature arthritis is clearly increased.In this case study a distal rupture of the syndesmosis in a young patient was overlooked in the initial diagnostic work-up.A search of the relevant literature and a case report.In the case described the shortened fibula and chronic instability of the tibiofibular syndesmosis were repaired with a lengthening and derotational osteotomy and reconstruction using the gracilis muscle tendon. Through this method an exact reconstruction of the normal anatomy could be achieved.Posttraumatic misalignment in the ankle joint is associated with a high risk of secondary degenerative lesions. In cases with suspicion of a syndesmosis lesion, confirmation of the diagnosis is imperative so as to perform an anatomic repositioning and reconstruction of stability.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687252","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.66794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.652371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.438752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.379007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.344444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Talus bone","weight":0.0694878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talus_bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Gracilis muscle","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracilis_muscle"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Syndesmosis","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndesmosis"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Imperative mood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Diplomatic recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Yemeni al-Qaeda crackdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_al-Qaeda_crackdown"},{"name":"Joint stability","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_stability"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"}]}
