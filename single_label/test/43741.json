{"id":43741,"title":"[Case of ischemic ileitis complicated by portal venous gas].","abstract":"A 65-year-old woman was admitted with sudden-onset abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed hepatic portal venous gas. Physical and laboratory examination suggested that a conservative approach was appropriate; however, 4 days later, the pain recurred and severe ischemic enteritis was diagnosed. A stenosis was identified 60 cm distal to the start of the ileum, and partial resection of the small intestine was performed. The diagnosis of ischemic enteritis was confirmed. Ischemic enteritis affecting the small intestine is uncommon, and enteritis causing intestinal stenosis with hepatic portal vein gas is even rarer.
