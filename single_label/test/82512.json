{"id":82512,"title":"The prospective study of autotransplanted severely impacted developing premolars: periodontal status and the long-term outcome.","abstract":"To determine the periodontal status and long-term outcomes of the surgical treatment of severely impacted developing premolars.Nine impacted and adversely angulated second premolars (four maxillary and five mandibular) were autotransplanted from their initial position to the ideal position within the arches (trans-alveolar autotransplantation). The mean age of patients at the time of the surgery was 13 years and 9 months (from 11 years and 5 months to 17 years) and the mean observation period was 5 years (from 2 to 8 years and 6 months). Naturally erupted, contralateral premolars in the same patients were used for comparison.The survival and success were 100%. Autotransplanted premolars did not differ statistically from their controls, except for having a wider zone of keratinized gingiva (mean difference 0.625 mm), increased probing depths (from 0.04 to 0.49 mm depending on the probing location), pulp canal obliteration and a slightly higher crown-to-root ratio (C/R = 0.71 for transplanted teeth and C/R = 0.6 for control teeth respectively).Trans-alveolar transplantation of severely impacted and adversely angulated developing premolars is a viable treatment option and an attractive alternative to other treatment modalities.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601990","annotations":[{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.625646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.583062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.551808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Keratin","weight":0.484724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.399023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.397256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.135474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Pharyngeal arch","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_arch"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"CR postcode area","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_postcode_area"}]}
