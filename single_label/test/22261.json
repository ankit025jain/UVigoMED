{"id":22261,"title":"Streptococcus agalactiae: an emerging cause of septic arthritis.","abstract":"Invasive Streptococcus agalactiae infection in nonpregnant women has been reported increasingly worldwide. This study reports the clinical features and outcome of S. agalactiae septic arthritis in Thai patients.The medical records of cases with septic arthritis seen between July 1990 and December 2010 were reviewed. Only those with S. agalactiae were included in this study.From 244 cases of septic arthritis, 38 (15.57%, 13 men and 25 women) were caused by S. agalactiae, with 34 of them (89.48%) occurring between 2008 and 2010. Their mean age was 52.89 (SD, 18.95) years. Twenty-four of the 38 patients (63.16%) had 1 or more underlying disease that might predispose to joint infection. Fever and joint pain were the most common symptoms presented. Eleven cases (28.95%) presented monoarthritis, 15 (39.47%) oligoarthritis, and 12 (31.58%) polyarthritis, with a mean joint involvement of 3.34 (SD, 2.35) joints (range, 1-8). Cellulitis was seen in 27 cases (71.05%). Blood cultures were positive in 31 patients (81.58%). Thirty-five of the 38 synovial fluid specimens obtained were enough for cultures and stain smears, with 24 (68.57%) growing S. agalactiae and 19 (54.29%) showing gram-positive cocci. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin. Ten patients (26.31%) received arthroscopic drainage. The articular outcome was good in 11 patients, fair in 24, and poor in 3. There were no deaths.Streptococcus agalactiae is an emerging cause of septic arthritis in Thai patients. Physicians should be especially aware of this condition in patients presenting with acute oligopolyarthritis and prominent cellulitis.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561409","annotations":[{"name":"Synovial fluid","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Polyarthritis","weight":0.80977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyarthritis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.754445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Coccus","weight":0.722288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccus"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Streptococcus agalactiae","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_agalactiae"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.394337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.311123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
