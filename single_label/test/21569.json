{"id":21569,"title":"Pseudoaneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva with coronary artery compression as the primary manifestation of infective endocarditis: a case report.","abstract":"A pseudoaneurysm of the native sinus of Valsalva compressing a coronary artery is extremely rare. Herein, the case is reported of infective endocarditis with a pseudoaneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva compressing the right coronary artery as the primary diagnostic finding, and its successful treatment. It is suggested that patients with suspected pseudoaneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva should undergo cardiac computed tomographic angiography for diagnosis of this condition.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597416","annotations":[{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.791023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.710265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Infective endocarditis","weight":0.709608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.588917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.455372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Right coronary artery","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.354215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Aortic sinus","weight":0.165522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_sinus"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0741325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Data compression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression"},{"name":"Native plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant"}]}
