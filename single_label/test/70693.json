{"id":70693,"title":"A statistical evaluation of common cancer trends and cancer occurrence by age group in the population of Lahore, Pakistan, 1984-2011.","abstract":"Due to the unavailability of a common cancer incidence database in Pakistan, the cancer incidence data from nuclear medicine and oncology institutes have been gathered and presented.The cancer incidence data for the last 27 years (1984-2011) is included to present a data set of male and female patients. The data analysis concerning occurrence, trends of common cancers in male and female patients, stage-wise distribution, and mortality/follow-up cases is also incorporated for the last 7 years (2004-2011).The cancer incidence rates for head and neck (13.41 percent), brain tumors (10.90 percent), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, 9.70 percent) were found to be the highest in male patients, whereas breast cancer (45 percent), ovary tumors (6.6 percent), and head and neck (6.21 percent) cancer incidence rates were observed to be the most common in female patients. The age range distribution of diagnosed and treated patients in conjunction with the percentage contribution of cancer-treated patients from different cities of Punjab at the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, Lahore is also included. Leukemia has been found the most common cancer for the age group of 1-12 years. It has been identified that the maximum number of diagnosed cases were found in the age range of 51-60 years for male and 41-50 years for female cancer patients.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153014","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Nuclear medicine","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.784866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.729728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.722947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.664112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.501026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.243552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.213497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Lahore","weight":0.193284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.144841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.139042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Punjab, Pakistan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"},{"name":"Distribution (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"}]}
