{"id":63617,"title":"CD1d expression is higher in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with unfavorable prognosis.","abstract":"Through the analysis of CD1d expression by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR we showed lower CD1d molecule and CD1d mRNA expression in B cells of CLL patients than of healthy controls. The frequency of CD1d(+)/CD19(+) cells, CD1d staining intensity and CD1d transcript levels increased with the disease stage. CD1d expression was positively associated with ZAP-70 and CD38 expressions as well as with unfavourable cytogenetic changes. We established the relationship between high CD1d expression and shorter time to treatment and overall survival. We observed that CD1d expression in individual patients significantly changed over time. The percentage of CD1d(+)/CD19(+) cells inversely correlated with the percentage of iNKT cells.
