{"id":7283,"title":"Fox smell abrogates the effect of herbal odor to prolong mouse cardiac allograft survival.","abstract":"Herbal medicines have unique odors, and the act of smelling may have modulatory effects on the immune system. We investigated the effect of olfactory exposure to Tokishakuyaku-san (TJ-23), a Japanese herbal medicine, on alloimmune responses in a murine model of cardiac allograft transplantation.Naïve or olfactory-dysfunctional CBA mice underwent transplantation of a C57BL/6 heart and were exposed to the odor of TJ-23 until rejection. Some naïve CBA recipients of an allograft were given olfactory exposure to Sairei-to (TJ-114), trimethylthiazoline (TMT), individual components of TJ-23, or a TJ-23 preparation lacking one component. Adoptive transfer studies were performed to determine whether regulatory cells were generated.Untreated CBA mice rejected their C57BL/6 allografts acutely, as did olfactory-dysfunctional CBA mice exposed to the odor of TJ-23. CBA recipients of a C57BL/6 heart given olfactory exposure to TJ-23 had significantly prolonged allograft survival, whereas those exposed to the odor of TJ-114, TMT, one component of TJ-23, or TJ-23 lacking a component did not. Secondary allograft recipients that were given, at 30 days after transplantation, either whole splenocytes, CD4+ cells, or CD4+CD25+ cells from primary recipients exposed to the odor of TJ-23 had indefinitely prolonged allograft survival.Prolonged survival of cardiac allografts and generation of regulatory cells was associated with exposure to the odor of TJ-23 in our model. The olfactory area of the brain may have a role in the modulation of immune responses.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886081","annotations":[{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.856024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.679496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.678392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Olfaction","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.640654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.568124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Odor","weight":0.315179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0894997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Joule","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Alloimmunity","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloimmunity"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Fox","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
