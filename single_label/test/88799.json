{"id":88799,"title":"[Effect of dinitrosyl iron complexes on erythrocyte energy metabolism under thermal trauma conditions].","abstract":"The effect of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNIC) on the energy metabolism of erythrocytes under combined thermal trauma conditions has been studied on a group of 30 Wistar rats, which was divided into 3 groups: intact (n = 10), control (n = 10), and main (n = 10). Combined thermal trauma (skin burn + thermoinhalation damage) was modeled in animals of the control and main groups. Rats of control group received infusions of sodium chloride solution (n = 10) every day. Rats of the main group obtained infusions of DNIC solution in sodium chloride. Rat blood samples were characterized by the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in direct and reverse reaction, lactate level, and coefficients of the substrate provision and energy reactions balance. It was stated, that DNIC clearly normalized the energy metabolism of erythrocytes beginning with the third day after thermal trauma onset.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791335","annotations":[{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.660801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.470625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.453812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.383893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.287499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Reversible reaction","weight":0.102962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_reaction"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.10095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0940385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"}]}
