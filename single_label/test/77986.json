{"id":77986,"title":"Ossicular reconstruction for incus long-process defects: bone cement or partial ossicular replacement prosthesis.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare hearing results in patients undergoing ossiculoplasty with bone cement (BC) vs partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) in cases of incudostapedial discontinuity during tympanoplasty surgeries.Case series with chart review.Tertiary referral center.A total of 44 patients with incudostapedial discontinuity, 21 operated on with BC and 23 operated on with PORP, were enrolled in this study.Preoperative and postoperative audiograms at 12 months were evaluated. Pure-tone averages and air-bone gaps (ABGs) were calculated according to the guidelines.The ABG was 26.61 dB preoperatively and 9.76 dB postoperatively in the BC group. The hearing gain in ABG was statistically significant (P = .0001). The preoperative and postoperative ABGs in the PORP group were 29.48 and 8.89 dB, respectively. The hearing gain in ABG was statistically significant (P = .0001). When the groups were compared for mean gains in the ABG, the difference was not statistically significant (P = .192). The postoperative ABG of less than 20 dB was achieved by 90.4% in the BC group and 86.9% in the PORP group. This difference was not statistically significant (P = .745). No adverse reactions or complications were observed.Both BC and PORP are reliable and efficient methods for the repair of incudostapedial joint defects. There is no difference between these 2 methods, based on the hearing results. Additional research is necessary to determine the maximum incudostapedial defect length suitable for bone cement repair.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825875","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.732436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Incus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incus"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Josh \"Puretone\" Abrahams","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_\"Puretone\"_Abrahams"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Alticor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alticor"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
