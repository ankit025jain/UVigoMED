{"id":87133,"title":"Polymorphism of Interleukin-6 is not associated with the presence or absence of high HPV E6/E7.","abstract":"The present study evaluated the frequency of the polymorphism of Interleukin-6 (IL6) in women positive for E6/E7 Human Papillomavirus (HPV) (n=152) and women negative for HPV (n=238), 390 women in total. Material for analysis was obtained at the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo. Interleukin-6 polymorphism was detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and analyzed in 3% agarose gel.No significant associations between the frequency of the polymorphism of IL6 in patients expressing E6 and E7 with HPV-positive and -negative reactions were found. There was no statistically significant difference between the case and control group for genotype distribution (p=0.280).Genotypic analysis showed a striking similarity of IL6 polymorphisms in both cases and controls. The allelic distribution in cases and controls for G and C of IL6 were very similar (p=0.186), which could point to similar IL6 functionality for both groups.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982360","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.729788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.588132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.362411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.357292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.342151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.20076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.15119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Agarose gel electrophoresis","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarose_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0471159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0390912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length"},{"name":"238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Federal government of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material"},{"name":"European route E6","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E6"}]}
