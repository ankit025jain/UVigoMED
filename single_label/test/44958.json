{"id":44958,"title":"Laparoscopic ultrasound for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis: quick, safe, and effective.","abstract":"Visualization of the common bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is frequently required to confirm or exclude choledocholithiasis. Although on-table cholangiogram (OTC) is the traditional imaging technique, laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) is increasingly deployed for this purpose. We are reporting a 31-month experience with an LUS, starting from the initial set up of the equipment. We retrospectively studied 70 patients who underwent LUS during their laparoscopic cholecystectomy operation over a period of 31 months. Data about preoperative investigation, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcome were retrospectively collected and analyzed. LUS was found to be quick, safe, and effective in the intraoperative diagnosis of the common bile duct stones. It does not add significantly to the operative time and is inherently safer than intraoperative cholangiogram owing to the fact that it does not involve ionizing radiation. It is also more convenient, as there is no need to wear protective lead to avoid the side effects of ionizing radiation.
