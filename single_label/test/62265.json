{"id":62265,"title":"miR-30-5p functions as a tumor suppressor and novel therapeutic tool by targeting the oncogenic Wnt/?-catenin/BCL9 pathway.","abstract":"Wnt/?-catenin signaling underlies the pathogenesis of a broad range of human cancers, including the deadly plasma cell cancer multiple myeloma. In this study, we report that downregulation of the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-30-5p is a frequent pathogenetic event in multiple myeloma. Evidence was developed that miR-30-5p downregulation occurs as a result of interaction between multiple myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells, which in turn enhances expression of BCL9, a transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt signaling pathway known to promote multiple myeloma cell proliferation, survival, migration, drug resistance, and formation of multiple myeloma cancer stem cells. The potential for clinical translation of strategies to re-express miR-30-5p as a therapeutic approach was further encouraged by the capacity of miR-30c and miR-30 mix to reduce tumor burden and metastatic potential in vivo in three murine xenograft models of human multiple myeloma without adversely affecting associated bone disease. Together, our findings offer a preclinical rationale to explore miR-30-5p delivery as an effective therapeutic strategy to eradicate multiple myeloma cells in vivo.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599134","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.842882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.731971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.604709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.602129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.422784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.28755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.243394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Coactivator (genetics)","weight":0.219945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
