{"id":46208,"title":"The occurrence of primary hepatic adenoma in deceased donor renal transplant recipient.","abstract":"We reported a case of new-onset, multi-focal hepatic adenoma in an 18 year-old man with no classic risk factors occurring forty months after a renal transplant from a cadaver donor. Histopathology of the adenoma was examined and genotype and phenotype were also analyzed. Histopathologic examination of the adenoma showed no malignancy. Genotype and phenotype analysis revealed no HNF1? or ?-catenin gene mutations and no inflammatory infiltration. The patient was well and disease-free postoperatively. CASE HYPOTHESIS: Hepatic adenoma occurs mostly in those taking oral contraceptives or androgenic-anabolic steroids or in those with hereditary diseases. Hepatic adenoma in a renal transplant recipient is rare and has only been reported in one case with glycogen storage disease type Ia. Immunosuppressive treatment might have contributed to the development of the neoplasm.Although malignant change occurs most often in ?-catenin gene mutation hepatic adenoma, surgical resection of the adenoma in a patient under immunosuppressive therapy should be considered in order to avoid the possibility of malignant transformation or hemorrhagic rupture.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System
