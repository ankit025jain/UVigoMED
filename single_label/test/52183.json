{"id":52183,"title":"Effectiveness and safety of negative-pressure wound therapy for diabetic foot ulcers: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The authors conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of negative-pressure wound therapy for diabetic foot ulcers.PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify relevant studies published up to February of 2013. All randomized controlled trials comparing negative-pressure wound therapy and non-negative-pressure wound therapy (i.e., standard wound care) for diabetic foot ulcers were included. Results were pooled using meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of negative pressure in managing diabetic foot ulcers.The databases were derived from eight qualified studies that included a total of 669 patients. Overall, compared with the non-negative-pressure wound therapy-treated diabetic foot ulcers, negative pressure resulted in a significantly higher proportion of healed ulcers (relative risk, 1.52; 95 percent CI, 1.23 to 1.89; p<0.001), more reduction of ulcer area (standardized mean difference, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.41 to 1.37; p=0.003), and shorter time to wound healing (standardized mean difference, -1.10; 95 percent CI, -1.83 to -0.37; p=0.003). Negative-pressure wound therapy patients also experienced significantly fewer major amputations (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent CI, 0.04 to 0.51; p=0.003), but the rate of minor amputations was not affected (p=0.837). No significant difference was observed between negative-pressure wound therapy and non-negative-pressure wound therapy (p=0.683). No heterogeneity among studies was detected.Negative-pressure wound therapy appears to be more effective for diabetic foot ulcers compared with non-negative-pressure wound therapy, and has a similar safety profile.Therapeutic, II.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622569","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.646187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.619018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.489296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.47281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.446785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.347521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.339153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.289508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.249773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.23601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.165553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
