{"id":19344,"title":"[Evidence-based practice for perioperative patient safety: preface and comments].","abstract":"Various kinds of evidence-based checklists and guidelines aimed at patient safety in the perioperative period are becoming popular in the clinical setting. These include WHO guidelines on surgical patient safety, surgical-crisis checklists, checklist for preventing major complications associated with cesarean delivery, NICE guidelines for surgical site infection, guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of pulmonary thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis, appropriateness criteria for stress echocardiography and so on. Better knowledge of evidence of these guidelines and check lists for acute care in the perioperative period helps us provide high-quality care for surgical patients. When we use the guidelines and checklists correctly, we could see what is happening in a patient and what to do next for the patient leading us to correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Thus, evidence-based practice will be established in the near future in the perioperative period.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724432","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.588502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.382248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"}]}
