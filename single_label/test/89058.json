{"id":89058,"title":"Occupational ladder fall injuries - United States, 2011.","abstract":"Falls remain a leading cause of unintentional injury mortality nationwide [corrected].Among workers, approximately 20% of fall injuries involve ladders. Among construction workers, an estimated 81% of fall injuries treated in U.S. emergency departments (EDs) involve a ladder. To fully characterize fatal and nonfatal injuries associated with ladder falls among workers in the United States, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analyzed data across multiple surveillance systems: 1) the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), 2) the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII), and 3) the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-occupational supplement (NEISS-Work). In 2011, work-related ladder fall injuries (LFIs) resulted in 113 fatalities (0.09 per 100,000 full-time equivalent [FTE] workers), an estimated 15,460 nonfatal injuries reported by employers that involved ?1 days away from work (DAFW), and an estimated 34,000 nonfatal injuries treated in EDs. Rates for nonfatal, work-related, ED-treated LFIs were higher (2.6 per 10,000 FTE) than those for such injuries reported by employers (1.2 per 10,000 FTE). LFIs represent a substantial public health burden of preventable injuries for workers. Because falls are the leading cause of work-related injuries and deaths in construction, NIOSH, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Center for Construction Research and Training are promoting a national campaign to prevent workplace falls. NIOSH is also developing innovative technologies to complement safe ladder use.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24759655","annotations":[{"name":"National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health","weight":0.932498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health"},{"name":"Occupational Safety and Health Administration","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.704043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.666864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.624967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.624663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.606453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Falling (accident)","weight":0.569189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_(accident)"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.524104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.22226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0632044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Full-time equivalent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent"},{"name":"Ladder","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Health administration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_administration"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Political campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign"},{"name":"Burglar alarm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglar_alarm"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"}]}
