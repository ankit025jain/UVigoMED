{"id":79263,"title":"[Meta-analysis on the risk factors for stomal recurrence after total laryngectomy].","abstract":"To evaluate the risk factors of stomal recurrence in patients after total laryngectomy.A thorough literature search was performed among Wanfang database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database of VIP and pubmed database. Meta analysis was performed on a total of 2725 patients in 2 Chinese papers and 6 English papers which met the inclusion criteria. Data was analyzed by RevMan 5.0 software.Subglottic and transglottic location (tumor location), the extent of the tumor of the primary site (T4), preoperative tracheotomy were important risk factors of recurrence after total laryngectomy.Subglottic and transglottic location (tumor location), the extent of the tumor of the primary site (T4), preoperative tracheotomy were related to stomal recurrence after total laryngectomy.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459925","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.350742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.160927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.135492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Scientific journal","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Recursion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion"},{"name":"Wanfang","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanfang"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"Meta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta"},{"name":"Very Important Person","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Important_Person"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"T4 (Channel 4)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T4_(Channel_4)"}]}
