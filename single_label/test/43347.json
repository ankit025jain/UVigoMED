{"id":43347,"title":"Mouse strain influences angiogenic response to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis.","abstract":"Angiogenesis is a known pathologic factor in chronic inflammatory diseases. Regarding the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis model, different mouse strains produce variable clinical and inflammatory responses. We hypothesize that DSS colitis applied to diverse mouse strains will similarly elevate colonic microvessel density in parallel with inflammation, but will do so with different angiogenic profiles.We induced DSS colitis in 129S2/SvPas, BALB/c, and C57BL/6 mice, then performed histologic and molecular analysis at day 7 to evaluate colonic inflammation and angiogenesis.Inflammation and microvessel density were similarly increased in DSS groups. The C57BL/6 cohort mounted a more severe colitis with 25% weight loss and greater colonic ulceration. Gene expression of angiogenic factors at baseline and in colitis groups were widely variable among strains. BALB/c mice exhibited higher angiogenic gene expression in control and DSS groups compared with other strains, specifically platelet-derived growth factor, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-2), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and PDGF receptor. When evaluating the effect of DSS relative to controls, BALB/c mice were not significantly affected. 129S2/SvPas mice exhibited broad suppression of growth factors, significantly platelet-derived growth factor, Ang-2, and PDGF receptor. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice displayed increased gene expression, especially for angiopoietin-1 and Ang-2.Genetic heterogeneity influences the angiogenic profile elicited by DSS colitis. We demonstrate that within a model of murine colitis, mouse strain significantly affects inflammation-associated angiogenesis. These results may impact strain selection when using a colitis model focusing on inflammation and angiogenesis. Future studies to further define the angiogenesis pathway and potentially alter the disease course with targeted antiangiogenics are warranted.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Digestive System
