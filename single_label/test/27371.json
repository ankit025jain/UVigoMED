{"id":27371,"title":"[Comparison of perioperative outcome after endovascular repair between symptomatic and asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm].","abstract":"To compare the perioperative outcome after endovascular repair (EVAR) of symptomatic abdominal aneurysms (S-AAAs) and elective non-symptomatic AAAs (E-AAAs).From January 2008 to February 2013, a total of 230 non-ruptured AAA patients treated by EVAR met the inclusion criteria. S-AAAs were present in 43 (18.7%) patients, 40 patients were male, 3 patients were female, aged (69 ± 10) years and E-AAAs in 187 (81.3%) patients, 162 of which were male, the other 25 patients were female, aged (71 ± 9) years. Patients were followed up at 1 month after EVAR. The primary outcome of the study was perioperative mortality, secondary outcome included procedural data and major perioperative adverse events.At baseline, there were no differences in age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification score, and basic diseases. S-AAA patients had larger aneurysms on average (6.00 (1.97) cm vs. 5.10 (1.7) cm, Z = 2.51, P = 0.01). S-AAA patients had shorter preoperative hospitalization (5.00 (5.0) days vs. 7.00 (4.0) days, Z = 1.86, P = 0.02). No differences in the perioperative mortality, respectively, 0 and 1.1% (P = 0.66). Technical success and clinical success were all 100% and the other procedure data was similar (P > 0.05). The occurrence of major adverse events, including mortality, within the 30-day after EVAR were similar between S-AAA and E-AAA patients (0 vs. 2.1%, P = 0.43).There is no difference in perioperative outcome between S-AAA and elective E-AAA patients treated by EVAR. More study is needed to compare the middle and long-outcome between S-AAAs and E-AAAs after EVAR.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034740","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.717131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.653571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.532642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.437146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Perioperative mortality","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative_mortality"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Procedural programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Amateur Athletic Association of England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Athletic_Association_of_England"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0153226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
