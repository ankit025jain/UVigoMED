{"id":86301,"title":"[Peculiarities and clinical significance of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during pregnancy].","abstract":"There are relatively few data reported on specific features of drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics in pregnancy compared to the non-pregnant state. Changes in maternal physiology and metabolic processes during pregnancy effect on PK and show that standard adult dosing is likely to be incorrect during pregnancy. Physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model could be used to evaluate different dosing regimens for pregnant women and to correctly predict drug exposure and response on the personal level.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791339","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.690269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.682741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiologically_based_pharmacokinetic_modelling"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"}]}
