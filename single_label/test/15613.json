{"id":15613,"title":"MAIT cells and pathogen defense.","abstract":"Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a unique population of innate T cells that are abundant in humans. These cells possess an evolutionarily conserved invariant T cell receptor ? chain restricted by the nonpolymorphic class Ib major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule, MHC class I-related protein (MR1). The recent discovery that MAIT cells are activated by MR1-bound riboflavin metabolite derivatives distinguishes MAIT cells from all other ?? T cells in the immune system. Since mammals lack the capacity to synthesize riboflavin, intermediates from the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway are distinct microbial molecular patterns that provide a unique signal to the immune system. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that MAIT cells, which produce important cytokines such as IFN-?, TNF, and IL-17A, have the potential to influence immune responses to a broad range of pathogens. Here we will discuss our current understanding of MAIT cell biology and their role in pathogen defense.","date":"2014-11-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164578","annotations":[{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.877721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.644004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.521577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.428008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.341192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Histocompatibility","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
