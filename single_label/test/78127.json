{"id":78127,"title":"Longitudinal assessment of endolymphatic hydrops with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the labyrinth.","abstract":"To visualize the progression of endolymphatic hydrops in a patient with Ménière's disease.A 53-year-old patient with definite Ménière's disease underwent locally enhanced inner ear magnetic resonance imaging (LEIM) for visualizing endolymphatic hydrops. Two years later, a second magnetic resonance imaging was performed for follow-up.The first magnetic resonance image confirmed the presence of endolymphatic hydrops and a treatment with betahistine was begun. Two years later, no more vertigo attacks occurred. The audiometry showed a deterioration of the hearing loss on both sides, whereas the caloric irrigation revealed normal results on both occasions. In comparison to the first examination, the second LEIM showed an augmented endolymphatic hydrops in both the cochlear and the vestibular compartments.For the first time, this case of Ménière's disease shows an enlargement of endolymphatic hydrops in 1 individual in the course of 2 years. A further development of the LEIM technique is desirable to enable the volumetric quantification of endolymphatic hydrops and to monitor the effect of therapies on the course of Ménière's disease.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770407","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.80242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.785321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.646611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.615926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.560996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.52438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.219913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Betahistine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betahistine"},{"name":"Labyrinth","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.0169501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Endolymph","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endolymph"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Mental image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"}]}
