{"id":33923,"title":"Development of an AP-FRET based analysis for characterizing RNA-protein interactions in myotonic dystrophy (DM1).","abstract":"FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy is a powerful tool used to identify molecular interactions in live or fixed cells using a non-radiative transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore in the excited state to an acceptor fluorophore in close proximity. FRET can be a very sensitive tool to study protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acids interactions. RNA toxicity is implicated in a number of disorders; especially those associated with expanded repeat sequences, such as myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)n repeat expansion in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene which results in nuclear retention of mutant DMPK transcripts in RNA foci. This results in toxic gain-of-function effects mediated through altered functions of RNA-binding proteins (e.g. MBNL1, hnRNPH, CUGBP1). In this study we demonstrate the potential of a new acceptor photobleaching assay to measure FRET (AP-FRET) between RNA and protein. We chose to focus on the interaction between MBNL1 and mutant DMPK mRNA in cells from DM1 patients due to the strong microscopic evidence of their co-localization. Using this technique we have direct evidence of intracellular interaction between MBNL1 and the DMPK RNA. Furthermore using the AP-FRET assay and MBNL1 mutants, we show that all four zinc-finger motifs in MBNL1 are crucial for MBNL1-RNA foci interactions. The data derived using this new assay provides compelling evidence for the interaction between RNA binding proteins and RNA foci, and mechanistic insights into MBNL1-RNA foci interaction demonstrating the power of AP-FRET in examining RNA-Protein interactions in DM1.
