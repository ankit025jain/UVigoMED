{"id":19626,"title":"Which is the optimal algorithm for the prevention of neonatal early-onset group B streptococcus sepsis?","abstract":"The incidence of neonatal early-onset group B streptococcus (GBS EOS) sepsis has declined during the last decade since the implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis endorsed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. All the CDC guidelines versions provide recommendations for neonatal management. The neonatal algorithm of CDC has not been universally accepted and hence different algorithms have been suggested. Since all approaches to disease prevention are still imperfect, an optimal algorithm for GBS EOS prevention is still lacking; the development of improved diagnostic methods of distinguishing at-risk infants may contribute to improve the clinician's approach.
