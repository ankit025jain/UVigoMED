{"id":73088,"title":"Cholesterol depletion induces ANTXR2-dependent activation of MMP-2 via ERK1/2 phosphorylation in neuroglioma U251 cell.","abstract":"Cholesterol is a critical component of lipid rafts implicated in regulating multiple signal transduction. The anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2) is a type I membrane protein acting as the second receptor for the anthrax toxin. In this study, we first investigated the association between cholesterol and ANTXR2. We provided the evidence that cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M?CD) promoted ANTXR2 expression in U251 neuroglioma cell, which was reversed by cholesterol supplement. M?CD-induced ANTXR2 up-regulation contributed to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was responsible for MT1-MMP and MMP-2 activation. Our data suggested that cellular cholesterol regulated ANTXR2-dependent activation of MMP-2 via ERK1/2 phosphorylation in neuroglioma U251 cell.
