{"id":28786,"title":"Homeschooled adolescents in the United States: developmental outcomes.","abstract":"The mission of schools has broadened beyond academics to address risk behaviors such as substance use, delinquency, and socialization problems. With an estimated 3.4% of all U.S. youth being homeschooled, this study examines how U.S. homeschoolers fare on these outcomes given their lack of access to these school services. Adolescents (ages 12-17) from the 2002 through 2011 National Surveys of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were divided based on school status (home vs. traditional schooling) and religious affiliation (stronger vs. weaker). Controlling for demographic differences, homeschoolers with weaker religious ties were three times more likely to report being behind their expected grade level and two and a half times more likely to report no extracurricular activities in the prior year than their traditionally schooled counterparts. This group was also more likely to report lax parental attitudes toward substance use. Findings suggest homeschoolers with weaker religious ties represent an at-risk group.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793392","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Juvenile delinquency","weight":0.79319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency"},{"name":"School","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Socialization","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.58092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.422917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Extracurricular activity","weight":0.298387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_activity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.229374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Parenting styles","weight":0.150106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles"},{"name":"School bus","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_bus"},{"name":"Homeschooling","weight":0.120181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Mission (Christianity)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_(Christianity)"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"1217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1217"},{"name":"Tenseness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseness"},{"name":"Fare","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Recklessness (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_(psychology)"}]}
