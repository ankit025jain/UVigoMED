{"id":76002,"title":"[Therapeutic effects of different doses of botulinum toxin A injection on tiptoe deformation in children with cerebral palsy].","abstract":"To study the therapeutic effects of different doses of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injection on tiptoe deformation in children with cerebral palsy.A total of 256 children with tiptoe deformation due to spastic cerebral palsy were classified into group A (muscle tension levels I-II, n=147) and group B (muscle tension levels III-IV, n=109). Group A was randomly divided into group A1 (injected with high-dose BTX-A, n=73) and group A2 (injected with low-dose BTX-A, n=74). Group B was randomly divided into group B1 (injected with high-dose BTX-A, n=55) and group B2 ( injected with low-dose BTX-A, n=54). The dose of BTX-A was 6 U/kg for groups A1 and B1 and was 3 U/kg for groups A2 and B2. Before the injection and at 1,2,6, and 12 months after injection, the muscle tension of limbs was evaluated with the modified Ashworth Scale, and the recovery of motor function of lower limbs was assessed with the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM).Before and after treatment, there were no significant differences in Ashworth and GMFM scores between groups A1 and A2 (P>0.05). After treatment, group B1 had a significantly reduced Ashworth score and a significantly increased GMFM score, and group B1 had a significantly lower Ashworth score and a significantly higher GMFM score compared with group B2 (P<0.05). For groups A and B, Ashworth score gradually declined post-treatment, reached the lowest point at 3 months after treatment, and returned to the level before treatment at 12 months after treatment; GMFM score gradually increased post-treatment and reached the peak level at 12 months after treatment (P<0.05).The level of muscle tension should be considered when BTX-A injection is used for treating tiptoe deformation in children with cerebral palsy. It makes no difference to use high- or low-dose BTX-A when the muscle tension level is within I-II, but high-dose BTX-A has a better performance in reducing muscle tension and improving motor function when the muscle tension level is within III-IV.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008880","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral palsy","weight":0.927138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Botulinum toxin","weight":0.719967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Motor skill","weight":0.315437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.290249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.23575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Spastic","weight":0.228415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic"},{"name":"Spastic diplegia","weight":0.1894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic_diplegia"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0961829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0310801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"List of U.S. states by elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_elevation"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tiptoe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiptoe"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
