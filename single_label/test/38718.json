{"id":38718,"title":"A patient-led educational program on Tourette Syndrome: impact and implications for patient-centered medical education.","abstract":"Graduate medical education about Tourette Syndrome does not typically focus on understanding the perspectives and perceptions of individuals with the condition.Explore the impact of patient-centered, patient-led education programs on participant knowledge and empathy for patients.Seventy-nine medical residents and students at five training sites in New Jersey attended patient-led presentations. Results were obtained using a pretest-posttest design assessing physician empathy, using the 10 perspective-taking items from the Jefferson Scale of Empathy. Additional understanding of residents' experience was obtained by analyzing participant generated reaction statements.A factorial ANOVA (pretest, Posttest × Gender × Specialty) revealed a significant increase (p < .05) from total pre-presentation scores to total post-presentation scores indicating that participants endorsed a more empathic view following the patient-led presentation. Participant statements revealed themes concordant with the practice of patient-centered medicine.Providing patient-led educational presentations to medical residents can increase physician empathy, increase knowledge of Tourette Syndrome, and support the advancement of patient-centered medical education.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405344","annotations":[{"name":"Physician","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.678346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.668745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Graduate school","weight":0.393744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_school"},{"name":"New Jersey","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"},{"name":"Residency (medicine)","weight":0.306677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Empathy","weight":0.241975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Factorial","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"},{"name":"Tourette syndrome","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Jersey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey"},{"name":"Thomas Jefferson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Concordant coastline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordant_coastline"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"}]}
