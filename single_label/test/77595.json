{"id":77595,"title":"Relationships between occupational stress and depressive symptoms among prison officers in Japan.","abstract":"The relationships between occupational stress and depressive symptoms in prison officers have rarely been studied in Japan. Thus, we analyzed the associations between occupational stress factors and depressive symptoms among Japanese prison officers.This was a cross-sectional study involving 426 male prison officers (20-60-year-old). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Using this scale and a cut-off point of 50, the subjects were divided into the \"depressive group\" and \"non-depressive group\". Occupational stress was evaluated using the Generic Job Stress Questionnaire. Comparisons among the groups were performed with multiple logistic regression analysis.Of the 426 subjects, 107 were included in the depressive group. After adjusting for demographic and occupational variables, higher scores for the physical environment, role ambiguity, and quantitative workload and a lower score for social support from co-workers were found to be associated with an increased odds ratio of depressive symptoms.The physical environment, role ambiguity, quantitative workload, and social support from coworkers are associated with depressive symptoms in Japanese prison officers. We hope that educating prison officers about the results of this study and organizational/individual-based improvement strategies will reduce their risk of depression.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575584","annotations":[{"name":"Japan","weight":0.766273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.708774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.499137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.461992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.411485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.407862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.368238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prison","weight":0.120262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Officer (armed forces)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"2060s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060s"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Penal system of Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_system_of_Japan"},{"name":"Prison officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_officer"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 426","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_426"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Workload","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
