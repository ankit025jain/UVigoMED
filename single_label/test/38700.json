{"id":38700,"title":"[Early prediction of acute kidney injury in infants and young children after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery].","abstract":"To understand the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in infants and toddlers and evaluate the possibility of predicting AKI with urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin 18 (IL-18), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), microalbumin (MA) and ?1-microglobulin (?1-MG) after surgeries for congenital heart diseases with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Fifty-eight children (ages ? 3 years) who had undergone surgery for congenital heart diseases with CPB were enrolled. Urinary samples were collected before and 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h post CPB to detect the concentration of NGAL, IL-18, NAG, MA and ?1-MG.The AKI group had 29 cases, none AKI group also had 29 cases. Urinary concentration of NGAL 4, 6, and 12 h post CPB were significantly higher in AKI group (2820 µg/g, 905.7 µg/g, 76.1 µg/g separately) than in none AKI group (27.6 µg/g, 19.5 µg/g, 16.0 µg/g separately, P < 0.01). Urinary concentration of IL-18 4, 6, 12 and 24 h post CPB were significantly higher in AKI group than in none AKI group (P < 0.05). Urinary concentration of NAG 4 h and 6 h post CPB were significantly higher in AKI group than in none AKI group (P < 0.01). Urinary concentration of MA/UCr post CPB 4 h, 6 h and 12 h were significantly higher in AKI group than in none AKI group (P < 0.05). Urinary concentration of ?1-MG/UCr post CPB 4 h, 6 h and 12 h were significantly higher in AKI group than in none AKI group (P < 0.01). All the five biomarkers had predictive abilities at 4-hour after surgery.Urine biomarkers NGAL, IL-18, NAG, MA and ?1-MG were valuable early predictors of AKI after CPB surgery.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406230","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.789811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.771483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.757526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.701117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.522637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.395062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.26538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0438327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Interleukin 18","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_18"},{"name":"Lipocalin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipocalin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"MG Cars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":".gg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.gg"},{"name":"Octane rating","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
