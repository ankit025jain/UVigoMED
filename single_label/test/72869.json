{"id":72869,"title":"Case for diagnosis.","abstract":"We report the case of an 11-year-old male patient with a histopathological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of dermatofibroma with an atypical clinical presentation on the right forearm. Although dermatofibroma is considered a benign skin tumor, some of its differential diagnoses, such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, are truly aggressive. Lesions with atypical clinical aspects and topology associated with specific histopathological variants are some of the criteria for complete tumor excision.
