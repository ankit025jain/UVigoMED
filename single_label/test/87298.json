{"id":87298,"title":"[Intravascular decompressive aerogenesis ultrasonography in a practice of diving medical physician].","abstract":"The aim of research was substantiation of necessity and accessibility of acoustic indication of intravascular decompressive aerogenesis in a practice of diving medical. Authors define possibilities of portable ultrasound blood flow indicator for location of decompressive gas bubbles. It was found that acoustic indication of intravascular decompressive gas bubbles made by simple portable ultrasonic blood flow meter allows to reveal moving gas bubble in blood flow. Authors came to conclusion that it is necessary to include portable ultrasonic diagnostic equipment into the norms of medical supply for ships, vessels and military units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286575","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.75673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.723269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.541137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.533623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.441259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Flow measurement","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Armed Forces of the Russian Federation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Gas chamber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chamber"},{"name":"Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation"},{"name":"Scuba diving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving"},{"name":"Diving medicine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_medicine"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"},{"name":"Liquid bubble","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_bubble"},{"name":"Military organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_organization"},{"name":"Ship","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship"}]}
