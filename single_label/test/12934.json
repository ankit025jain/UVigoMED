{"id":12934,"title":"Immune response to Newcastle disease virus vaccination in a wild passerine.","abstract":"We studied the immune response of wild House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) experimentally challenged with different doses of inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine. We evaluated within-individual cell-mediated and humoral responses in birds kept in outdoor aviaries, over a 6-wk period. Nonbreeding adult House Sparrows developed a significant humoral response to NDV experimental vaccination within 1 wk postchallenge, as measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay; values increased until week 4 and persisted until week 6. Differences among treatments appeared by week 1, with individuals challenged with the highest dose (0.2 mL) eliciting a higher humoral response than the rest (n = 18). By week 4, all individuals vaccinated displayed an increased humoral response, with individuals challenged with the highest dose remaining significantly above responses of individuals vaccinated with the middle dose (0.1 mL, n = 14), but not the lowest dose (0.05 mL, n = 15). The middle and lowest dose responded similarly and significantly different from controls (n = 23). Differences persisted through week 6 postchallenge. Cell-mediated responses were independent of the experimental treatment. All individuals experienced a rise in granulocyte concentration, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte concentrations decreased, most likely as a result of captivity. Adult wild House Sparrows immunochallenged with inactivated NDV vaccine developed a specific humoral response, highlighting the utility of this technique in immunologic and evolutionary ecology studies in wild birds.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502730","annotations":[{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.869741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Hemagglutination","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutination"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.800433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.76033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.758056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.601443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Newcastle disease","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_disease"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.277943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Passerine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Evolutionary ecology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ecology"},{"name":"Aviary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviary"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"House Sparrow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Sparrow"},{"name":"House (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Passer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Domesticus (Roman Empire)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticus_(Roman_Empire)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Sparrow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Captivity (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captivity_(animal)"},{"name":"2011 Six Nations Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Six_Nations_Championship"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
