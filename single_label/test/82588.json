{"id":82588,"title":"Clinical evaluation of 16% and 35% carbamide peroxide as in-office vital tooth whitening agents.","abstract":"Tooth bleaching (whitening) is a conservative and cost effective treatment of discoloured teeth.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 16% and 35% carbamide peroxide as in-office bleaching agents.Thirty adult subjects who desired to whiten their discoloured teeth were enrolled in the study. Carbamide bleaching agents, in concentrations of 16% and 35%, were used to whiten their teeth employing the spilt-arch technique/half-mouth design using vacuum formed half-arch matrix seated over the maxillary teeth for a one-hour session per week for two weeks. Outcome was monitored with Vita shade guide and photographs.Twenty females and ten males, ages 18-43 years, with mean age 27.83 years, participated in the study. Tooth whitening was obtained in all subjects. Shade tab movement of 2-4 shades and 4-6 shades was recorded at first sessions then 3-5 and 5-9 shades at second sessions for 16% and 35% concentrations of carbamide peroxide respectively. The bleaching outcome was significantly better with the 35% concentration of carbamide peroxide while transient tooth sensitivity was observed in both concentrations ofthe bleaching agents.Carbamide peroxide in 16% and 35% concentration are effective and safe for bleaching discoloured vital teeth, however, 35% concentration gave significantly more lightening effect without additional side effects compared to 16% concentration.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579500","annotations":[{"name":"Urea","weight":0.56748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.329832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bleach","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach"},{"name":"Carbamide peroxide","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamide_peroxide"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Tooth bleaching","weight":0.127918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_bleaching"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0690403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Dentine hypersensitivity","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Vacuum forming","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_forming"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"1843","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1843"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Shade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade"},{"name":"Tooth (human)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_(human)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pornography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Livor mortis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livor_mortis"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
