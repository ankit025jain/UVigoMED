{"id":86486,"title":"Reliability and validity of the Thai version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.","abstract":"To assess the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity of the Thai version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Thai-PSQI), which was recently translated using a standardized method, in Thai patients with major sleep disorders.The Thai-PSQI was developed under a standard translation protocol and administered to \"bad\" sleepers (i.e. patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea [OSA], depression, or insomnia) and \"good\" sleepers in an academic tertiary care setting. All participants were asked to complete the same questionnaire after 2-4 weeks.A total of 138 participants consisting of 69 patients with OSA, 28 with major depression, 11 with primary insomnia, and 30 controls completed the questionnaire. The global scores of the Thai-PSQI revealed that it had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.837) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89). An analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant difference in Thai-PSQI global score between good sleepers and bad sleepers (p < 0.001). A cut-off point of 5 out of 6 on the global score resulted in a sensitivity of 77.78% and specificity of 93.33%.The Thai-PSQI is a valid and reliable tool for screening and identifying the presence of significant sleep disturbances, and is comparable to the original English version.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772581","annotations":[{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.794437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.741659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.637615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.632277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.412575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.324431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.257481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.211902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Pittsburgh","weight":0.104326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"837","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/837"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Railroad tie","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_tie"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Covariance","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"}]}
