{"id":73759,"title":"[Quality control in pathology and theranostics in head and neck cancers].","abstract":"Head and neck malignant tumors diagnosis require both standardized technical and personalized management in order to optimize patient care and therapy. The quality of multidisciplinary discussion for that goal needs common vocabulary. More than morphology, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, additional molecular theranostics approaches are in fast progress in head and neck cancers, as well as their other anatomic counterparts.
