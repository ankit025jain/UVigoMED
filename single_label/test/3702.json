{"id":3702,"title":"Bilateral synchronous breast cancer.","abstract":"We report a rare case of synchronous bilateral breast cancer in 79-year-old female patient treated at our hospital. The tumors were discovered one year ago after a complete clinical and radiological (mammography, US) examination with cytopunction of tumor masses. Results came back and showed carcinomas of both breasts. Patient underwent surgical re moval of the both breasts with bilateral axillary lymphadenectomy. Later histological examination confirmed earlier diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma in both breasts in a G3 stage. After surgical removal of the tumors patient was also treated with radiotherapy. One year after bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy, clinical and radiological examination that included mammography and ultrasound of breast with tumor marker C15-3 which was 2.8, we did not found recurrence of the tumor.","date":"2014-11-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420392","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.829848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.722795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ductal carcinoma","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.506284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.401224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.391339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.380868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"1992","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
