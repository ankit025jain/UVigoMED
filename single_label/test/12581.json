{"id":12581,"title":"Paroxetine attenuates the development and existing pain in a rat model of neurophatic pain.","abstract":"P2X4 receptor (P2X4R), a purinoceptor expressed in activated spinal microglia, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Spinal nerve injury induces up-regulation of P2X4R on activated microglia in the spinal cord, and blockade of this receptor can reduce neuropathic pain. The present study was undertaken to determine whether paroxetine, an inhibitor of P2X4R, could attenuate allodynia and hyperalgesia in chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain when used preemptively or after the sciatic nerve injury.Male Wistar rats (150-200 g, n = 6) were divided into 3 different groups: 1- CCI vehicle-treated group, 2- Sham group, and 3- CCI paroxetine-treated group. Paroxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 1 h before surgery and continued daily until day 14. In other part of the study, paroxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered at day 7 post injury and continued daily until day 14. von Frey filaments for mechanical allodynia and analgesia meter for thermal hyperalgesia were used to assay pain behavior.In a preventive paradigm, paroxetine significantly attenuated both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia (P<0.001). A significant decrease in pain behavior was seen with paroxetine on existing allodynia (P<0.001) and hyperalgesia (P<0.01) when initiated at day 7 post injury.It seems that paroxetine can attenuate pain behavior when administered before and also after sciatic nerve injury in CCI model of neuropathic pain.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Animal
