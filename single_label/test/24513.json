{"id":24513,"title":"[Application of FilmArray assay for detection of respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised persons].","abstract":"A variety of viruses and bacteria are responsible for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections worldwide. Severe and even fatal disease can occur especially in group ofimmunocompromised individuals. Accurate pathogen identification allows clinicians to determine the need for ancillary diagnostic testing, antibacterial and/or antiviral therapy and can motivate decisions regarding hospitalization and infection control measures.We compared the diagnostic performance of FilmArray Respiratory Panel highly multiplexed nucleic acid amplification test with previous used direct immunofluorescence assay. Both assays were performed on a panel of 6 nasopharyngeal-secretion specimens and 6 BALF samples, collected from 12 patients, subjected to allogeneic haematological stem cells transplantation, with lower respiratory tract symptoms.Among viruses detectable by both assays were especially influenzaA virus, parainfluenza viruses type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, the FilmArray assay is rapid and extremely user-friendly system, with results available in just over one hour with almost no labor involved. In few laboratories its low throughput and qualitative results may be a disadvantage in some clinical settings.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
