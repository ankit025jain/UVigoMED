{"id":89766,"title":"Prevention of arthrofibrosis after arthroscopic screw fixation of tibial spine fracture in children and adolescents.","abstract":"Arthrofibrosis is a major complication of tibial spine fracture treatment in children, potentially resulting in knee pain, quadriceps weakness, altered gait, decreased function, inability to return to sports, and long-term osteoarthritis. Thus, prevention rather than treatment of arthrofibrosis is desirable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an aggressive postoperative rehabilitation and early intervention approach to prevent permanent arthrofibrosis after tibial spine fracture treatment and to compare epiphyseal and transphyseal screws for fixation. A consecutive series of 24 patients younger than age 18 with displaced type II and III tibial spine fractures who underwent arthroscopic reduction and screw fixation between 2006 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Final range of motion was compared between patients with epiphyseal (n=12) and transphyseal (n=9) screws. One-third (4 of 12) of patients with epiphyseal screws underwent arthroscopic debridement and screw removal approximately 3 months postoperatively; 3 patients lacked 5° to 15° of extension, 1 experienced pain with extension, and 1 had radiographic evidence of screw pullout, loss of reduction, and resultant malunion. In the transphyseal screw group, 3 patients had 10° loss of extension, and all corrected after arthroscopic debridement and screw removal. The two groups did not significantly differ in time to hardware removal or return to sports or final range of motion. No growth disturbances were identified in patients after transphyseal screw removal. An aggressive approach of postoperative rehabilitation and early intervention after arthroscopic reduction and screw fixation of tibial spine fractures in children was successful in preventing permanent arthrofibrosis.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683658","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.76687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.695781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.683517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.620194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.610022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.544251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.467429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.459725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.279552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Arthrofibrosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrofibrosis"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Resultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant"},{"name":"Early childhood intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_intervention"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
