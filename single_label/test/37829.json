{"id":37829,"title":"Management during the first 72 h of age of the periviable infant: an evidence-based review.","abstract":"After NICU admission the extremely immature newborn (EIN) requires evaluation and support of each organ system, and the integration of all those supports in a comprehensive plan of care. In this review, I attempt to analyze the evidence for treatment options after the initial transition, during the first 3 days of life, which have been shown to improve survival or short- or long-term morbidity. This review revealed several things: there is little available evidence from studies that have included significant numbers of EINs; interventions affecting different organ systems need to be co-ordinated as any intervention will have multiple effects; and future advances in treatment of this group of patients will require the installation of permanent research networks to have enough power to perform many studies needed to improve outcomes.
