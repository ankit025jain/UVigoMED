{"id":82841,"title":"Neuro-proprioceptive facilitation in the re-education of functional problems in facial paralysis. A practical approach.","abstract":"Facial paralysis, in the form of Bell's syndrome, is an acute paralysis of idiopathic origin. Disability in patients with this medical condition is the result of impairment or loss of complex and multidimensional functions of the face like emotion expression through facial mimics, facial identity and communication.This study aimed to present new and improved practical manual techniques in the area of facial neuromuscular facilitations and to review the literature for disability indexes and facial nerve grading.We present the practical modality of using neuro-proprioceptive facilitation techniques, such as rhythmic initiation, repeated stretch (repeated contractions), combination of isotonics and percussion, and also report the effects of these techniques in three Bell's syndrome patients which were previously evaluated.Recovery from facial paralysis can be a difficult and long lasting process and the utilization of a grading system may help the physical therapist. The effects of this type of therapy may help_benefit the patient if the therapist is well trained and familiar with the neurophysiological background.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505900","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.819139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.658333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.566177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.431296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.324467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Percussion instrument","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.0824958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Facial nerve paralysis","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve_paralysis"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Medical condition","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_condition"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Bell (instrument)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_(instrument)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Recovery (Eminem album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_(Eminem_album)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Mind control","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_control"}]}
