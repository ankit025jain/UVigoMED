{"id":63090,"title":"Interleukin 28B gene polymorphisms and Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases.","abstract":"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the interleukin (IL) 28B gene encoding a type III interferon (IFN-?) are the most important genetic predictors of treatment response to hepatitis C virus (HCV). This retrospective study was undertaken to determine any association between IL28B SNPs and the development of viraemia in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).Genomic DNA extracted from plasma from 45 EBV seropositive controls and 46 acute IM, 23 non-PTLD (transplant) and 21 PTLD patients was tested by PCR for 2 SNPs within IL28B. EBV DNA levels were tested in IM and PTLD samples by a real-time quantitative PCR.No significant differences were seen in SNP frequencies at rs12979860 and rs8099917 in IM and PTLD patients compared to EBV seropositive controls and transplant patients. EBV DNA levels were lower in IM and PTLD patients with CC (a favourable genotype in HCV) at rs12979860 compared to non-CC genotypes (p = 0.055). Acute IM patients with CC had significantly lower levels of EBV DNA in plasma compared to those with non-CC genotypes (p = 0.011).Genotype CC may influence anti-viral responses of IFN-?, thereby allowing better control of EBV viraemia during lymphoproliferation, particularly in IM.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480970","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious mononucleosis","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.84925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.744544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.733877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.732852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.656039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.651978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.648901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.564559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.421841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Interleukin 28","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_28"}]}
