{"id":59332,"title":"Spinal cord stimulation in pregnancy with failed back surgery syndrome.","abstract":"Women of child-bearing age who are candidates for trial and possible implantation of a spinal cord stimulator (SCS) may express concerns regarding its effect on their ability to become pregnant, to maintain a pregnancy and to breastfeed. Despite the large number of SCS implanted worldwide there is a paucity of data regarding its effect on fertility and the course of the pregnancy. We describe a case of 32 year old lady in our centre who became pregnant after SCS implantation and had an uneventful pregnancy with delivery of a healthy baby which was breastfed.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834587","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.733976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.294179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.238241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Spinal cord stimulator","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_stimulator"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Failed back syndrome","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_back_syndrome"},{"name":"Laminectomy","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminectomy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
