{"id":54242,"title":"Autonomy support and responsibility-sharing predict blood glucose monitoring frequency among youth with diabetes.","abstract":"Adolescence poses a number of special challenges for youth and their families managing the Type 1 diabetes medical regimen. Little is known on how family and youth factors and management of the regimen change over the course of early adolescence and predict adherence to the regimen during this developmental period.Youth with Type 1 diabetes (n = 239) and their maternal caregivers completed measures of diabetes-specific autonomy support, diabetes-related family conflict, regimen responsibility, and blood glucose monitoring frequency (BGMF) at 4 timepoints over a 3-year period.Autonomy support and BGMF significantly decreased over time and responsibility for the diabetes regimen shifted from the caregiver toward youth over time. Significant changes in perceived family conflict over time differed depending on the reporter. Baseline BGMF, changes in caregiver autonomy support, and changes in responsibility for the regimen significantly predicted changes in BGMF over time.This study documents changes in autonomy support, youth responsibility for the diabetes regimen, and BGMF during the transition into early adolescence. Higher levels of caregiver autonomy support preserve BGMF during a developmental period in which BGMF typically deteriorates.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467252","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.0180135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"239","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/239"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Welfare_and_Sport_(Netherlands)"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Child development stages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stages"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"War","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
