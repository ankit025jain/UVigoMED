{"id":52392,"title":"Smart insulins.","abstract":"This review addresses a futuristic frontier of diabetes pharmaco-therapeutics. It describes the current status, and future prospects, of development of smart insulins, i.e., insulins which self-regulate their release, in response to ambient glycaemic levels. This approach helps to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia, and ensures physiological control. The article discusses the various technical strategies used to create such smart insulin.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605725","annotations":[{"name":"Risk","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.0472222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Frontier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier"},{"name":"Future","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future"},{"name":"Smart (automobile)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(automobile)"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"Ambient music","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music"}]}
