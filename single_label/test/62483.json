{"id":62483,"title":"Donor-derived CD4(+)/CCR7(+) T-cell partial selective depletion does not alter acquired anti-infective immunity.","abstract":"In previous studies, we observed that a high proportion of donor-derived CD4(+) T cells expressing the chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) was a major determinant of acute GVHD, without interfering with the incidence of other post-transplant outcomes, especially relapse and nonrelapse mortality rates. Here, we investigated in vitro the impact of partially selective CD4(+)/CCR7(+) T lymphocytes on acquired anti-infective immune response in 10 donors who underwent G-CSF-primed PBSC collection. Similar quantitative and functional proliferative reactions were observed in lymphocyte cultures in the presence of adenovirus and pp65 Ags with unmanipulated and partially depleted donor samples. No responses were observed in the presence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 used as a negative control. These results complete the proof of concept needed to build a clinical trial investigating partially selective CD4(+)/CCR7(+) T cell-depleted allo-SCT.
