{"id":3586,"title":"Periocular pilomatrixoma: case report.","abstract":"The aim is to present a case of pilomatrixoma in the periocular area in a 10-year-old female through retrospective review of medical records of a single patient. A 10-year-old female developed a lesion under her right eyebrow over a period of one year. The rest of the ophthalmic history was unremarkable. On examination, oval, well-defined, subcutaneous tumor measuring 7 x 4 mm was found under the right eyebrow. It gave bluish tint under the firmly adherent overlying skin of normal color and texture. Rocky hard and non-tender, it was mobile over the underlying tissues. Total excision biopsy was performed under general anesthesia. Histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis ofpilomatrixoma. Pilomatrixoma is a rare tumor with head, neck and periocular area being the commonest sites. It is often clinically misdiagnosed and/or missed on differential diagnosis. Although a benign tumor, malignant transformation into pilomatrix carcinoma has been described. Thus, total surgical excision of the mass is recommended.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509249","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.685497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Eyebrow","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyebrow"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
