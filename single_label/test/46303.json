{"id":46303,"title":"Non-invasive assessment of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD using controlled attenuation parameter and 1H-MR spectroscopy.","abstract":"Non-invasive assessment of steatosis and fibrosis is of growing relevance in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 1H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and the ultrasound-based controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) correlate with biopsy proven steatosis, but have not been correlated with each other so far. We therefore performed a head-to-head comparison between both methods.Fifty patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and 15 healthy volunteers were evaluated with 1H-MRS and transient elastography (TE) including CAP. Steatosis was defined according to the percentage of affected hepatocytes: S1 5-33%, S2 34-66%, S3 ?67%.Steatosis grade in patients with NAFLD was S1 36%, S2 40% and S3 24%. CAP and 1H-MRS significantly correlated with histopathology and showed comparable accuracy for the detection of hepatic steatosis: areas under the receiver-operating characteristics curves were 0.93 vs. 0.88 for steatosis ?S1 and 0.94 vs. 0.88 for ?S2, respectively. Boot-strapping analysis revealed a CAP cut-off of 300 dB/m for detection of S2-3 steatosis, while retaining the lower cut-off of 215 dB/m for the definition of healthy individuals. Direct comparison between CAP and 1H-MRS revealed only modest correlation (total cohort: r?=?0.63 [0.44, 0.76]; NAFLD cases: r?=?0.56 [0.32, 0.74]). For detection of F2-4 fibrosis TE had sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 98.1% at a cut-off value of 8.85 kPa.Our data suggest a comparable diagnostic value of CAP and 1H-MRS for hepatic steatosis quantification. Combined with the simultaneous TE fibrosis assessment, CAP represents an efficient method for non-invasive characterization of NAFLD. Limited correlation between CAP and 1H-MRS may be explained by different technical aspects, anthropometry, and presence of advanced liver fibrosis.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637477","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.710292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.683038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.590963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.307159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.128079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.0732274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"DBm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBm"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Bootstrapping (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Tight end","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Efficiency (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"}]}
