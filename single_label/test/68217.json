{"id":68217,"title":"Long-term follow-up after transurethral treatment of infravesical obstruction in boys.","abstract":"To study whether boys who underwent transurethral treatment of (mild) infravesical obstruction during childhood have lower urinary tract symptoms and complications at young adult age.Young adult men who underwent transurethral treatment for infravesical obstruction as a child were contacted. The following measurements were done: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire on Urinary Incontinence, frequency volume chart uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual. A group of 151 male students who completed IPSS and underwent uroflowmetry was used as reference group to compare with patients.Of 135 traceable patients, 87 men (median age 21.9 years; interquartile range [IQR] 19.6-25.6) returned the questionnaires, and 71 underwent uroflowmetry. Median age at initial treatment was 7.9 years (IQR 1.0-10.8). Compared with men in the reference group, patients had similar IPSS and quality of life scores; median IPSS was 3, and IPSS-quality of life 1 (IQR 0.0-1.0). Urgency incontinence and postmicturition incontinence were reported in 2.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Frequency volume charts (n = 29) showed normal frequency and voided volumes. Uroflowmetry results were comparable with the reference group, although 16 (22.5%) patients voided volumes >600 mL. One patient had urethral stricturing, and one a significant postvoid residual.Young adult men treated for (mild) urethral obstruction in childhood have few micturition symptoms and good uroflowmetry results, not different from a reference group. Some patients, however, report incontinence, and this group deserves close attention. Late complications were rare.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548707","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.788203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.748529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.491594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.255496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Urinary urgency","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_urgency"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Urine flow rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_flow_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Age of consent","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Consultation (Texas)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultation_(Texas)"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Young adult (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_(psychology)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Void (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(law)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
