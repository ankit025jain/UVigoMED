{"id":82600,"title":"Effectiveness of a new fluoride varnish for caries prevention in pre-school children.","abstract":"To investigate the effectiveness of a new fluoride varnish (Clinpro White Varnish, 3MEspe, Seefeld, Germany) with regard to the caries incidence within a 2-year periodA non-randomized sample of 400 children from the Kyffh√§user district (Thuringia, Germany) was divided into a fluoride group (FG, biannual application of fluoride varnish) and control group (CG, no intervention). (Non-)cavitated caries lesions were recorded using World Health Organization (WHO) and Universal Visual Scoring System (UniViSS) criteria. Parents were given questionnaires to gather information about their socio-economic status (SES). Non-parametric methods and binomial logistic regression were used for data analysis.There was a significant increase in caries incidence in both groups. The number of non-cavitated carious lesions was significantly lower in the FG (mean 2.2; sd 2.3) compared with the CG (mean 2.9; sd 1.9). Initial statistical analysis revealed that fluoride varnish might prevent non-cavitated carious lesions. When including SES as a confounder into regression model, potential preventive effect was lost.This study underlines the importance of the multi-factorial etiology of caries and illustrates that the effectiveness of biannual fluoride varnish application was evident in non-cavitated carious lesions only.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic
