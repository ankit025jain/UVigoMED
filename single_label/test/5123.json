{"id":5123,"title":"Analysis of the effects of heparin and enoxaparin on degloving injuries.","abstract":"Heparin and low molecular weight heparin are the most frequently used antithromboembolic drugs in fractures.We aimed to compare the effects of heparin and enoxaparin, which are used as standard treatment, on viability in degloving injuries.Thirty rats were used in the study. Three groups were composed including 10 rats in each group. Degloving injuries were formed in the tails of the rats. Enoxaparin was injected subcutaneously to the rats in group 1. Standard heparin was injected subcutaneously to the rats in group 2. Serum physiologic solution was injected subcutaneously to the rats in group 3. The experiment was ended on day 15. The tails of the rats were evaluated clinically and histopathologically.There was a statistically significant difference in the clinical results (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the histopathological results (p < 0.05).We encountered positive effects of both heparin and enoxaparin on the treatment of degloving injuries in this experimental study. However, the findings of this study should be supported and improved by new experimental and especially clinical studies (Fig. 3, Ref. 18).","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318913","annotations":[{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.851428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.685301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.64294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.596721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Low molecular weight heparin","weight":0.587414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_molecular_weight_heparin"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.560822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.552287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.482254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.45895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Enoxaparin sodium","weight":0.273049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoxaparin_sodium"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Degloving","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degloving"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"2011 French Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_French_Open"}]}
