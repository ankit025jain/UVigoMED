{"id":67691,"title":"Overactive bladder changes with time: a 5-year longitudinal followup of changes in overactive bladder symptoms, urodynamic studies and urinary nerve growth factor levels.","abstract":"We compared clinical symptoms, urodynamic diagnoses and urinary nerve growth factor levels at baseline and 5 years later in patients with overactive bladder.Patients diagnosed with overactive bladder at a tertiary teaching hospital who underwent urinary nerve growth factor tests 5 years previously were identified by chart review. Patients were invited to return for symptom evaluation, urodynamic studies and a repeat urinary nerve growth factor test. Changes in overactive bladder subtype, urgency severity score and urodynamic diagnosis were classified as improved, stable or worse. Changes in urinary nerve growth factor/creatinine were compared between baseline and 5 years later according to changes in bladder conditions.A total of 30 women and 45 men completed the study. Mean±SD age was 73.5±10.3 years. Urinary nerve growth factor/creatinine showed no significant difference among patients with improved, stable or worse bladder conditions based on overactive bladder or urgency severity score subtypes. However, urinary nerve growth factor/creatinine was significantly decreased in patients with an improved urodynamic diagnosis (mean 0.94±1.36 vs 0.17±0.19 pg/mg, p=0.02), significantly increased in patients with a worse urodynamic diagnosis (0.55±0.85 vs 2.08±2.81 pg/mg, p=0.04) and showed no change in those with a stable urodynamic diagnosis. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the change in urodynamic diagnosis was still predictive of the change in urinary nerve growth factor/creatinine after adjusting for age, gender, overactive bladder and urgency severity score subtypes (p=0.001).Urinary nerve growth factor/creatinine did not reflect the changes in bladder conditions based on subjective symptoms. However, the levels reflected dynamic changes in bladder pathophysiology according to urodynamic findings.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594404","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.715254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.594196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.359972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.247891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.218084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Nerve growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"941","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/941"},{"name":"Chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Dynamics (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Winning percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage"},{"name":"Psychodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
