{"id":11331,"title":"[MAIT cells in autoimmunity].","abstract":"Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells express a semi-invariant TCR? chain: V?7.2-J?33 in humans and V?19-J?33 in mice. They are restricted by a nonpolymorphic MHC-related molecule-1 (MR1), and cells are selected in the thymus. Interestingly, MAIT cells require B cells as well as commensal flora for their peripheral expansion. MAIT cells display antimicrobial capacity. Recently, vitamin metabolites were demonstrated as antigens created by intestinal flora for MAIT cells. MAIT cells play a protective role against autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of human multiple sclerosis (MS), wheras they play a pathogenic role in murine models of arthritis. In patients with autoimmune diseases, the frequency of MAIT cells in peripheral blood was significantly reduced. The frequency of MAIT cells reflected the disease activity in MS patients, suggesting the involvement of MAIT cells in the regulation of autoimmune diseases.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598064","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.778288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.777604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.288635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.178625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","weight":0.14807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_autoimmune_encephalomyelitis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Encephalomyelitis","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalomyelitis"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
