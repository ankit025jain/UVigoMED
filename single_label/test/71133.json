{"id":71133,"title":"Assessment of comorbidities in surgical oncology outcomes.","abstract":"The impact of comorbidities on treatment, postoperative complications, survival, prognosis, and quality of life, makes comorbidities' assessment essential in surgically managed cancer patients. Multiple indices exist to measure the presence and severity of comorbidities, of which the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 are the most widely employed. Incorporation of comorbidity data in cancer registries facilitates surgical oncology research conduct with an objective to improve cancer care through better-informed patient counseling and treatment planning.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25100618","annotations":[{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.662005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.624413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.23589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
