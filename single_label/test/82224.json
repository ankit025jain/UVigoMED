{"id":82224,"title":"The impact of a laser-microtextured collar on crestal bone level and clinical parameters under various placement and loading protocols.","abstract":"Physical attachment of connective tissue fibers to a laser-microtextured (8- and 12-?m grooves) surface on the collar of an implant has been demonstrated using human histology. Related clinical research has suggested that this microtextured surface may help to decrease initial bone loss after implant placement. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare crestal bone heights and clinical parameters between implants with laser-microtextured and machined collars placed and loaded with different protocols.This study evaluated 300 single implants in 300 patients (155 men, 145 women; mean age: 49.3 years; range: 45 to 75 years). One hundred sixty implants with laser-microtextured collars (L) and 140 with machined collars (M) were used. Implants were grouped into the treatment categories of immediate placement, delayed placement, immediate nonocclusal loading, and delayed loading. For all groups, crestal bone level, attachment level (CAL), Plaque Index, and bleeding on probing were recorded at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after loading with the definitive restoration.Nine implants were lost (four L and five M). The type of implant and timing of placement and loading showed no significant influence on survival rates. A mean CAL loss of 1.12 mm was observed during the first 2 years in the M group, while the mean CAL loss observed in the L group was 0.55 mm. Radiographically, L group implants showed a mean crestal bone loss of 0.58 mm, compared to 1.09 mm for the M group.A laser-microtextured surface on the implant collar may mitigate the negative sequelae associated with peri-implant bone loss, regardless of the placement and loading protocols used.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic
