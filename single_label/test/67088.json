{"id":67088,"title":"[The choice of method of treatment of patients with stones in ureteropelvic junction].","abstract":"Stones located in the UPJ are accompanied by the most severe violation of the upper urinary tract urodynamics compared to other localizations of stones, which often leads to severe septic complications requiring emergency care. The study has evaluated the results of treatment of 147 patients with UPJ stones using various methods of treatment, and their efficacy in these patients. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) was performed in 55 patients, contact ureterolithotripsy (CULT)--in 23 patients, percutaneous nephroureterolithotripsy and nephroureterolithoextraction (PCNLT and PCNLE)--in 43 patients, and open surgery (ureterolithotomy, pelviolithotomy)--in 26 patients. The best results in all parameters were obtained from patients with stone size up to 1 cm after ESWL, as well as in patients with stone size greater than 1 cm after PCNLT (PCNLE). In these groups, full discharge of stone at 3 months after treatment was achieved in 95 and 97.7% of patients, respectively. Complications in the ESWL group were recorded in 14.6% of patients, in the PCNLT (PCNLE) group--in 9.2% of patients.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649758","annotations":[{"name":"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy","weight":0.819147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_shock_wave_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.511431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Lithotripsy","weight":0.508502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotripsy"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Localization of a ring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_ring"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"United for Peace and Justice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_for_Peace_and_Justice"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Urolithiasis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolithiasis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"}]}
