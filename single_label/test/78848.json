{"id":78848,"title":"Cochlear implantation in a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia before allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"Bilateral deafness can occur in patients with acute leukemia and it can cause communication problems and depressed mood during the treatment of leukemia. Cochlear implantation (CI) is the choice of hearing rehabilitation; however, there is scarce information about the safety of CI during the treatment of leukemia. A 50-year-old female leukemia patient was successfully implanted with a Nucleus cochlear implant while in complete remission before peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Until now, with a follow-up of 4 years, the patient has useful hearing perception without any complications. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a successful CI in a patient with acute leukemia during the treatment of leukemia.
