{"id":72638,"title":"Reliability of immunostaining using pan-melanoma cocktail, SOX10, and microphthalmia transcription factor in confirming a diagnosis of melanoma on fine-needle aspiration smears.","abstract":"Accurate fine-needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosis of metastatic melanoma is of therapeutic and prognostic significance and often requires ancillary studies. To the authors' knowledge, the reliability of immunostaining using a pan-melanoma cocktail, Sry-related HMG-BOX gene 10 (SOX10), and microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) in confirming a diagnosis of melanoma on FNA smears has not been studied to date.This retrospective study included 50 FNA cases with a definitive diagnosis of melanoma. Twenty-nine cases were epithelioid type (group 1), and 21 cases were predominantly spindle cell type with or without an epithelioid component (group 2). Each case was immunostained using pan-melanoma cocktail, SOX10, and MITF. Staining intensity and the percentage of positive cells were recorded.The pan-melanoma cocktail was positive in 43 cases (86%), SOX10 was positive in 50 cases (100%), and MITF in 45 cases (90%). SOX10 and MITF demonstrated nuclear staining with stronger and more diffuse staining with less or no background staining compared with pan-melanoma cocktail, which displayed cytoplasmic staining. For pan-melanoma cocktail and SOX10, the detection rates were identical in groups 1 and 2 (86% with pan-melanoma cocktail and 100% with SOX10). For MITF, the detection rate was higher in group 1 compared with Group 2 (93% vs 86%).In the current study, SOX10 was found to have the highest overall detection rate, followed by MITF and pan-melanoma cocktail. The pan-melanoma cocktail and SOX10 performed equally well for groups 1 and 2, and MITF had a higher detection rate in group 1. Overall, SOX10 and MITF appeared to be superior to the pan-melanoma cocktail and SOX10 seemed better than MITF in confirming a diagnosis of melanoma on FNA smears.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954720","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphthalmia-associated_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.762962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.64616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.561076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.272072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Microphthalmia","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphthalmia"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"SOX10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX10"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Cocktail","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail"},{"name":"SOX genes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX_genes"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Spindle neuron","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_neuron"}]}
