For these 52 plasmodium positive individuals, the blood retests and case investigations were completed within 3 days after these cases were reported by the network system, and the investigation confirmed that they were foreign imported malaria cases. The malaria focus investigation and disposition were finished within 1 week and the data were reported by the Parasitic Diseases Information System.
