{"id":29512,"title":"Towards a framework for implementing evidence based alcohol interventions.","abstract":"Alcohol is ranked as the eighth leading cause of death globally and is a causal factor in more than sixty major types of diseases and injuries and results in approximately 2.5 million deaths a year. This study tested the feasibility of screening and brief intervention (SBI) within four emergency departments. A total of 944 patients were screened for hazardous and harmful alcohol use. The results showed that there was good co-operation from the public with 888 (94%) people agreeing to be screened. The screening tool detected that 460 (49%) of those needed no intervention, 345 (36%) needed brief advice and 83 (9%) required referral to specialist services. This showed the value of the screening but also helped to reassure staff that people were happy to take part.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654479","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.461024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"345","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/345"},{"name":"944","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/944"},{"name":"888","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/888"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Dangerous goods","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Offensive (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_(military)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
