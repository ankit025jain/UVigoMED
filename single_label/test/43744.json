{"id":43744,"title":"[Virtual enteroscopy for the evaluation of stenosis in a case of chronic multiple ulcers of the small intestine].","abstract":"A 39-year-old female presented to our hospital with diarrhea, vomiting, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Virtual enteroscopy was performed to evaluate the small bowel; we found annular stenoses at 89, 100, 116, 147, and 154 cm from the ligament of Treitz. Small bowel resection was performed, and annular ulcers were confirmed at 58, 71, 90, 130, 138, 218, and 225 cm from the ligament of Treitz. Clinical records and pathological examination failed to determine the cause of these ulcers, and we diagnosed chronic multiple ulcers of the small intestine. Thus, we believe that virtual enteroscopy can be beneficial in preoperatively diagnosing multiple ulcers and stenoses in the small bowel.
