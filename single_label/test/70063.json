{"id":70063,"title":"Epidemiology, risk factors, prevention, and early detection of melanoma.","abstract":"The incidence of melanoma has increased over the past several decades. Despite improved case mortality, overall deaths from melanoma have increased because of the large increase in incidence. Although we have a better understanding of the pathogenesis of melanoma and improved early diagnostic capabilities, the burden of disease and societal costs remain high. This article provides an update on the epidemiology of cutaneous melanoma worldwide and the common risk factors including heritable and modifiable risks, emphasizing the importance of education, early detection, and prevention in reducing the disease burden.
