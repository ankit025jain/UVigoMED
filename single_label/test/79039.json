{"id":79039,"title":"The efficacy of unilateral bone-anchored hearing devices in Chinese Mandarin-speaking patients with bilateral aural atresia.","abstract":"The bone-anchored hearing device (BAHD) was not introduced in China until 2010. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the efficacy of Chinese Mandarin-speaking patients with bilateral aural atresia.To evaluate the speech recognition of Chinese Mandarin-speaking patients with BAHDs as well as patients' satisfaction using 2 questionnaires.A retrospective case review of 16 patients with bilateral aural atresia conducted at a tertiary referral center.A BAHD was implanted during auricle reconstruction surgery or after the auricle was rebuilt. A surgical method to combine the BAHD implantation with the second stage of ear reconstruction was introduced.Speech audiometry test and mean pure-tone threshold results were compared among patients with unaided hearing and those with BAHDs. Scores from the BAHD user questionnaire and Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory (GCBI) were used to measure patients' satisfaction and subjective health benefit.The mean (SD) speech discrimination scores measured in a sound field with a presentation level of 45 dB HL (hearing level) were 6.7% (7.4%) unaided and 86.5% (4.4%) with a BAHD. Scores with a presentation level of 65 dB HL were 56.5% (7.4%) unaided and 90.1% (3.4%) with a BAHD. The speech reception threshold was 60.6 (7.5) dB HL unaided and 24.7 (5.0) dB HL with a BAHD. The mean (SD) pure-tone threshold of the patients was 61.6 (7.8) dB HL unaided and 23.8 (5.9) dB HL with a BAHD. The BAHD application questionnaire demonstrated excellent patient satisfaction. The mean (SD) benefit score of GCBI was 45.6 (14.4).For aural atresia, the BAHD has been one of the most reliable methods of auditory rehabilitation. It can improve the patient's word recognition performance and quality of life. The technique of BAHD implantation combined with auricular reconstruction in a 2-stages-in-1 surgery and the modified incision of patients with reconstructed auricle proved to be safe and effective.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503772","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.632976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.614763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.499801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Pinna (anatomy)","weight":0.449522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.376873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Speech recognition","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.199749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.172891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.123825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0461352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Word","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Value theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_theory"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Ossicles","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Party","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
