{"id":32796,"title":"Transcatheter occlusion of azygos/hemiazygos vein in patients with systemic venous collateral development after the bidirectional Glenn procedure.","abstract":"To elucidate the feasibility and treatment effects of transcatheter occlusion of the azygos/hemiazygos vein in patients with progressive cyanosis after performing the bidirectional Glenn procedure.From January 2007 to May 2011, transcatheter closure was performed on 9 patients (7 males and 2 females) aged 5-15 years (median 9 years).A total of 7 azygos veins and 3 hemiazygos veins were occluded successfully. Coils were employed in 4 of the procedures, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occluders in 3, atrial septal defect occluders in 2 and a PDA occluder together with coils in 1 procedure. Immediate complete occlusions were achieved in 9 (81.8%) procedures and trivial residual shunt in 2 (18.2%). The femoral artery oxygen saturation (SaO2) rose from 81 [interquartile range (IQR) 75-86%] to 88% (IQR 84-91%).Patients with superior vena cava azygos vein collateral channels can be treated successfully by transcatheter occlusion with multiple devices. The device for embolization depends on the extent of the severity of the shunt, the size of the lumen of the azygos vein/hemiazygos vein and the candidate location for occlusion.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903599","annotations":[{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Patent ductus arteriosus","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.772315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.735704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.685769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.574063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Azygos vein","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azygos_vein"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.487555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.423605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.345291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Systemic venous system","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_venous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Personal digital assistant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"},{"name":"Hemiazygos vein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiazygos_vein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cardiac shunt","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_shunt"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Coil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coil"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Occlusion culling","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_culling"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"}]}
