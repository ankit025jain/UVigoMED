{"id":53292,"title":"Comparison of time- and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in management of diabetic macular edema.","abstract":"Some clinical trials that proved the benefits of anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic macular edema (DME) based retreatment decisions on visual acuity and time-domain ocular coherence tomography (TD-OCT) central subfield thickness changes since the last treatment. This study assessed the impact of TD-OCT followed by spectral domain (SD)-OCT on as needed treatment decision-making in the management of DME with anti-VEGF medications.Patients previously treated for DME with anti-VEGF medications in the Retina Division of the Wilmer Eye Institute, following an institutional review board-approved informed consent process, underwent clinical examination, TD-, and SD-OCT imaging. Their retina specialists recorded whether additional anti-VEGF therapy was recommended and their level of certainty in the decision after performing a clinical examination and reviewing a TD-OCT, and then again after reviewing a SD-OCT.Data were collected for 129 treatment decision pairs involving 67 eyes from 46 subjects. Nonconcordant decisions occurred in 9 (7%) treatment decision pairs. In 7 of these (5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%-11%), the addition of SD-OCT changed the retina specialist's decision from not recommending to recommending retreatment. The addition of SD-OCT increased the certainty of the retina specialist in 36% (95% CI: 27%-45%) of all treatment decision pairs.Spectral-domain OCT does not appear to change the ultimate treatment decision or increase the level of certainty of the retina specialist relative to TD-OCT in most cases of DME under anti-VEGF management in clinical practice. The few nonconcordant decisions appear to trend toward recommending more anti-VEGF therapy following SD-OCT.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526445","annotations":[{"name":"Retina","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.757316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.626289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.619924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.594083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.556292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.476785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.439588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.354578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.303665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Distance measuring equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measuring_equipment"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins Hospital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital"},{"name":"Field extension","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_extension"},{"name":"Wilmer, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer,_Texas"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Certainty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
