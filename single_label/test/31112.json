{"id":31112,"title":"Double-locus sequence typing using porA and peb1A for epidemiological studies of Campylobacter jejuni.","abstract":"Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of foodborne bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Bacterial typing schemes play an important role in epidemiological investigations to trace the source and route of transmission of the infectious agent by identifying outbreak and differentiating among sporadic infections. In this study, a double-locus sequence typing (DLST) scheme for C. jejuni based on concatenated partial sequences of porA and peb1A genes is proposed. The DLST scheme was validated using 50 clinical and environmental C. jejuni strains isolated from human (C5, H, H15-H19), chicken (CH1-CH15), water (W2-W17), and ovine samples (OV1-OV6). The scheme was found to be highly discriminatory (discrimination index [DI]=0.964) and epidemiologically concordant based on C. jejuni strains studied. The DLST showed discriminatory power above 0.95 and excellent congruence to multilocus sequence typing and can be recommended as a rapid and low-cost typing scheme for epidemiological investigation of C. jejuni. It is suggested that the DLST scheme is suitable for identification of outbreak strains and differentiation of the sporadic infection strains.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24404778","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Campylobacter","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Campylobacter jejuni","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter_jejuni"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.61704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.578368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.465467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.452562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.187384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.162483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"W2W","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W2W"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Trace (linear algebra)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)"},{"name":"Typewriter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter"},{"name":"Concatenation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation"},{"name":"Order of the Companions of Honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Concordant coastline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordant_coastline"},{"name":"Porsche 964","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_964"},{"name":"Eastern Pomo language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Pomo_language"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"H19 (gene)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H19_(gene)"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Scheme (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics)"},{"name":"LSWR H15 class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSWR_H15_class"},{"name":"Discovery Investigations","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Investigations"}]}
