{"id":81263,"title":"Influence of implant surface topography on bone-regenerative potential and mechanical retention in the human maxilla and mandible.","abstract":"To evaluate the short- and mid-term effects of commercial pure (cp) titanium implant surface topography on osseointegration, bone-regenerative potential and mechanical retention in the human maxilla and mandible.32 micro-implants with the same geometry but with four different surface treatments were implanted in the maxilla and mandible of eight patients. Each patient received four micro-implants, one of each type. Percentage of bone-to-implant contact analysis and histological evaluation was carried 3, 6 and 12 weeks after implantation. Furthermore, reverse removal torque tests were conducted 3 and 6 weeks after implantation to analyze functional bone attachment. Implant surfaces tested were: machined, grit-blasted, acid-etched, and grit-blasted with acid-etch. One-way ANOVA was performed using the multiple comparison Fisher's test to determine significance of observed differences among test groups. The level of significance was established at 5% (P < 0.05). Mean and standard deviations of the test groups were calculated.Surface roughness had a significant correlation with the evolution of bone regeneration. The surfaces with roughness Ra approximately 4 microim (grit-blasted and grit-blasted with acid-etch), showed rapid tissue colonization compared to machine and acid-etched surfaces. The results of reverse removal torque tests confirmed a significant correlation between surface roughness and functional bone attachment. Grit-blasted and grit-blasted with acid etched surfaces showed higher retention values compared to machine and acid-etched implants. This finding was supported by higher bone-to-implant contact observed for rougher surfaces (grit-blasted and grit-blasted with acid etching).","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25208367","annotations":[{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.528547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.489734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.307409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.162983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.16009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.121183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0967484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Multiple comparisons","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons"},{"name":"Etching","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etching"},{"name":"Surface roughness","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_roughness"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Cp (Unix)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix)"},{"name":"Surface finishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_finishing"},{"name":"Glass etching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_etching"},{"name":"One Way (South Korean band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Way_(South_Korean_band)"},{"name":"Machining","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Ra","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra"}]}
