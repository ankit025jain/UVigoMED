{"id":36470,"title":"[Prosopagnosia--a case report].","abstract":"Face recognition plays a key role in initiation and coordination of social interactions. Face is a source of many valuable information about sex, age, health and emotional state of another person. Face perception is also considered as the best developed component of human visual perception. The term prosopagnosia means the inability to recognize faces previously known, while still remaining the ability to correctly identifying other objects from the surroundings. This dysfunction can affect face recognition of famous people, family members or even own face. Affected person correctly names the object (knows, that he deals with the \"face\"), properly assess the emotional expression of a second person, adequately identifies the sex and age of observed person, but cannot determine who the person is. The aim of this study is to present a case of a patient complaining about emotional dysfunctions and presence of prosopagnosia symptoms following neurosurgery for arteriovenous malformation in the right temporal lobe.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575649","annotations":[{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.868774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.812764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.592441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Face perception","weight":0.550636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.308618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Prosopagnosia","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia"},{"name":"Facial recognition system","weight":0.155599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Emotional expression","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_expression"},{"name":"Celebrity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0162377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
