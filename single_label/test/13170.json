{"id":13170,"title":"Exendin-4 decreases liver inflammation and atherosclerosis development simultaneously by reducing macrophage infiltration.","abstract":"The aetiology of inflammation in the liver and vessel wall, leading to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and atherosclerosis, respectively, shares common mechanisms including macrophage infiltration. To treat both disorders simultaneously, it is highly important to tackle the inflammatory status. Exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, reduces hepatic steatosis and has been suggested to reduce atherosclerosis; however, its effects on liver inflammation are underexplored. Here, we tested the hypothesis that exendin-4 reduces inflammation in both the liver and vessel wall, and investigated the common underlying mechanism.Female APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a model with human-like lipoprotein metabolism, were fed a cholesterol-containing Western-type diet for 5 weeks to induce atherosclerosis and subsequently treated for 4 weeks with exendin-4.Exendin-4 modestly improved dyslipidaemia, but markedly decreased atherosclerotic lesion severity and area (-33%), accompanied by a reduction in monocyte adhesion to the vessel wall (-42%) and macrophage content in the plaque (-44%). Furthermore, exendin-4 reduced hepatic lipid content and inflammation as well as hepatic CD68? (-18%) and F4/80? (-25%) macrophage content. This was accompanied by less monocyte recruitment from the circulation as the Mac-1? macrophage content was decreased (-36%). Finally, exendin-4 reduced hepatic chemokine expression in vivo and suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein accumulation in peritoneal macrophages in vitro, effects dependent on the GLP-1 receptor.Exendin-4 reduces inflammation in both the liver and vessel wall by reducing macrophage recruitment and activation. These data suggest that exendin-4 could be a valuable strategy to treat NASH and atherosclerosis simultaneously.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Animal
