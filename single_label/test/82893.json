{"id":82893,"title":"[Herbal acupoint sticking combined with electroacupuncture therapy in the treatment of Bell's palsy: a randomized controlled trial].","abstract":"To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) combined with herbal acupoint sticking in the treatment of Bell's palsy and provide optimizations for the clinic.One hundred and two cases of Bell's palsy were randomized into an EA combined with herbal acupoint sticking group (group A, 50 cases) and an EA group (group B, 52 cases), EA at Cuanzhu (BL 2), Yangbai (GB 14), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Quanliao (SI 18),Xiaguan (ST 7), Yingxiang (LI 20), etc. were applied in both groups and \"facial paralys No.I \" was applied at Yifeng (TE 17) in group A, once daily and 10 times totally were needed. The score of facial nerve function, clinical efficacy were compared before and after treatment. At 1 and 3 month follow up visit, the quality of life scale( WHOQOL-BREF) and the occurrence of complication were observed.The scores of facial nerve function in group A and group B were all significantly improved compared with those before treatment (48. 2+/- 2. 9 vs 25. 7 +/- 4. 9, 45. 9 +/- 6. 2 vs 25. 8 +/- 5. 5, both P<O. 01), the cured rate in group A [82.0% (41/50)] were significantly superior to that in group B [67. 3% (35/52)](P<0. 05); the difference of WHOQOL-BREF in both groups at 1 and 3 month follow up visit was not significant(all P>0. 05). The occurrence of complication in group A (1 case) was significantly less than that in group B (8 cases, P 0. 05).Compared with EA, the combination of EA and acupoint sticking therapy for Bell's palsy cannot only improve the clinical efficacy and reduce the occurrence of complication but also reliable without any side effect.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494279","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.710295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.586886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.524712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.515945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Liberal International","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_International"},{"name":"Program optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Electronic Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Tight end","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Gigabyte","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_1"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
