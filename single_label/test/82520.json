{"id":82520,"title":"Use of Twin Block of Clark in management of Angle's Class II Division I malocclusion. Case report.","abstract":"A case report on the orthodontic management of a 10-year-old female patient with Angle's Class II Division I malocclusion, 12 mm overjet, incompetent lips, a deep bite and a lower midline shift to the right using the Twin Block of Clark is presented. Treatment objectives included reduction of the overjet and overbite, obtaining a Class I molar and canine relationship, and improving the patient's profile. After a thorough patient assessment, a two-phase orthodontic treatment plan was chosen with myofunctional therapy using the Twin Block constituting the first phase of treatment. Second phase of treatment was to be carried out using a preadjusted edgewise appliance system. Active treatment with the Twin Block lasted for nine months. Patient's compliance with the appliance was good, and an overjet reduction to 4.5 mm was achieved with an improvement in facial profile after the first phase of treatment. The Twin Block of Clark is a very good treatment alternative in managing selected cases of Angle's Class II Division I malocclusion.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600762","annotations":[{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.557154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.450641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.233534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.146864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0993063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Angles","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"1 millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_millimetre"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Regulatory compliance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance"},{"name":"Mean line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_line"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"The Twin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twin"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Horse teeth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_teeth"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Soviet First League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_First_League"},{"name":"Division I (NCAA)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)"}]}
