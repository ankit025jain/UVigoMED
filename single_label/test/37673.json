{"id":37673,"title":"Maternal-fetal attachment and prenatal diagnosis of heart disease.","abstract":"To test the hypothesis that there are differences in the level of maternal-fetal attachment before and after fetal echocardiography in the presence or absence of cardiac abnormalities.Cohort study in which the mothers responded to a validated Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale. The study compared a group of pregnant women with diagnosis of fetal heart disease (FHD) with a group without this diagnosis (\"no fetal heart disease\" - NFHD).197 pregnant women were included, 96 FHD and 101 NFHD. Maternal-fetal attachment at the initial and final periods showed no significant baseline differences between groups (p=0.081). At the final period, migration from medium to high level of attachment was significantly higher in FHD (p=0.017). Transition from medium to high levels comparing the initial and final periods was more pronounced in FHD (p=0.009).Diagnosis of fetal heart disease increases the level of maternal-fetal attachment.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480110","annotations":[{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.672546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.622519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.454163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"Fetal circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_circulation"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"}]}
