{"id":28515,"title":"Difference of the naltrexone's effects in social drinkers by spicy food preference.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in subjective acute effects of alcohol and naltrexone among those who prefer spicy food to varying degrees. Acute biphasic alcohol effects scale (BAES), visual analogue scale for craving (VAS-C), blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and food preference scale were measured in 26 men. Repeated measures ANOVA (2 preference groups×4 time blocks) on the stimulative subscale of BAES revealed a significant group by block interaction in naltrexone condition (N+) (P<0.001), but not in non-naltrexone condition (N-). Furthermore, repeated measures ANOVA (2 drug groups×4 time blocks) on the stimulative subscale of BAES revealed a significant group by block interaction in strong preference for spicy food (SP) (P<0.001), but not in lesser preference for spicy food (LP). The paired t-test revealed that significant suppression of the stimulative subscale of BAES was observed at 15 min (P<0.001) and 30 min (P<0.001) after drinking when N+ compared with N- in SP. For those who prefer spicy food, the stimulative effect of acute alcohol administration was suppressed by naltrexone. This result suggests that the effect of naltrexone may vary according to spicy food preference.
