{"id":28446,"title":"Kinetic characterization of human butyrylcholinesterase mutants for the hydrolysis of cocaethylene.","abstract":"It is known that the majority of cocaine users also consume alcohol. Alcohol can react with cocaine to produce a significantly more cytotoxic compound, cocaethylene. Hence a truly valuable cocaine-metabolizing enzyme as treatment for cocaine abuse/overdose should be efficient for not only cocaine itself, but also cocaethylene. The catalytic parameters (kcat and KM) of human BChE (butyrylcholinesterase) and two mutants (known as cocaine hydrolases E14-3 and E12-7) for cocaethylene are characterized in the present study, for the first time, in comparison with those for cocaine. On the basis of the obtained kinetic data, wild-type human BChE has a lower catalytic activity for cocaethylene (kcat=3.3 min(-1), KM=7.5 ?M and kcat/KM=4.40 × 10(5) M(-1)·min(-1)) compared with its catalytic activity for (-)-cocaine. E14-3 and E12-7 have a considerably improved catalytic activity against cocaethylene compared with the wild-type BChE. E12-7 is identified as the most efficient enzyme for hydrolysing cocaethylene in addition to its high activity for (-)-cocaine. E12-7 has an 861-fold improved catalytic efficiency for cocaethylene (kcat=3600 min(-1), KM=9.5 ?M and kcat/KM=3.79 × 10(8) M(-1)·min(-1)). It has been demonstrated that E12-7 as an exogenous enzyme can indeed rapidly metabolize cocaethylene in rats. Further kinetic modelling has suggested that E12-7 with an identical concentration as that of the endogenous BChE in human plasma can effectively eliminate (-)-cocaine, cocaethylene and norcocaine in simplified kinetic models of cocaine abuse and overdose associated with the concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24870023","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.667072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.657002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.570816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.520807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cocaethylene","weight":0.194746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaethylene"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Butyrylcholinesterase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyrylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Hydrolase","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolase"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"861","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/861"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"},{"name":"Bachelor of Engineering","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Engineering"}]}
