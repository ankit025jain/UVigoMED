{"id":78193,"title":"Technology intervention research with deaf and hard of hearing learners: levels of evidence.","abstract":"The authors evaluated the research base relative to technology use with deaf and hard of hearing students, examining 29 peer-reviewed studies published January 2000-August 2013 that used technology-based intervention (multimedia instructional applications/software) and investigating its effects on academic variables (academic skills used in instructional settings). They then evaluated the studies according to quality indicators for evidence-based research, both individually and as a body of evidence supporting intervention for deaf and hard of hearing students (Gersten et al., 2005; Horner et al., 2005; Institute of Education Sciences, 2013; Kratochwill et al., 2010, 2013). One of 24 group design studies met all Essential Quality Indicators; 3 of 5 single-case design studies did (Horner et al., 2005). No reviewed technology intervention met criteria for an established evidence base. Interventions are presented across technology types and academic areas to facilitate discussion of implications for researchers and practitioners.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745105","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.547624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Multimedia","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.0355872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Institute of Education Sciences","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Education_Sciences"},{"name":"Institute of Education","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Education"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Military base","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_base"},{"name":"Essential Marvel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_Marvel"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
