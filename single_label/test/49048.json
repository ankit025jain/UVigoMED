{"id":49048,"title":"Interventions to maintain cardiac risk control after discharge from a cardiovascular risk reduction clinic: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of two maintenance strategies compared to usual care after discharge from a pharmacist-led cardiovascular risk reduction clinic (CRRC).Open-label, randomized-controlled trial of 200 consecutive CRRC patients that met clinic discharge criteria (HbA1c ?7% (53 mmol/mol); blood pressure ?140/80 mmHg for those with diabetes and ?140/90 mmHg for those without diabetes; and an LDL-cholesterol ?2.59 mmol/l). Participants were randomized to either quarterly group medical visits or quarterly CRRC individual clinic visits, or a usual care control arm with the standard primary care alone first in a 1:1:1 ratio, followed by a 2:2:1 ratio after first 100 patients. Primary outcome measures were time to failure for guideline recommended goals of HbA1c and blood pressure over 12-months.Of the 200 participants randomized, 89% had diabetes and were similar in other cardiovascular risk factors. After 1-year, the HbA1c failure rate was 0.36 [95% CI, 0.28-0.47] per quarter for the group medical visit arm, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.18-0.33] per quarter for the quarterly CRRC individual arm and, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.96] per quarter for the usual care control arm, p<0.001. The rate of failure for blood pressure was 0.31 [95% CI, 0.23-0.41] per quarter for the group medical visit arm, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.16-0.30] per quarter for the CRRC individual arm and, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.40-0.71] per quarter the control arm, p<0.001.After discharge from a CRRC program, both individual and group interventions are more effective in maintaining glycemia and blood pressure control for patients with diabetes than usual care after 1-year of follow-up.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969964","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.876448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.559575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.446357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.407608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.322491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.21961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Control arm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_arm"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Magazine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Combat Rubber Raiding Craft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Rubber_Raiding_Craft"},{"name":"Scottish term days","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_term_days"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
