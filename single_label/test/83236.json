{"id":83236,"title":"Lack of evidence for predictive and prognostic value of cyclin D1 gene polymorphism CCND1 G870A for oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) has a G to A polymorphism at the splice donor site of exon 4, position 870. The A allele codes for a truncated variant, cyclin D1b, which may have higher transforming activity. Data regarding the predictive and prognostic value of the CCND1 G870A polymorphism in tumors are controversial. We aimed to examine this polymorphism in patients with oral carcinoma.Genotyping of CCND1 G870A was determined by means of direct sequencing in 83 patients with oral carcinomas and in 102 healthy controls. Association with clinical outcomes was evaluated statistically.We failed to find any significant association of CCND1 G870A with risk of oral carcinomas in this German population, with clinical and pathological features of the tumours or with overall survival of the patients.Our results suggest that CCND1 G870A has no, or only very limited, predictive and prognostic value for oral carcinoma.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403468","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.886534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.801093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.531426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.496777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.129987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"870","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/870"},{"name":"Germans","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Truncation (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"}]}
