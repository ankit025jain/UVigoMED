{"id":69250,"title":"Increased severity of inflammation correlates with elevated expression of TRPV1 nerve fibers and nerve growth factor on interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.","abstract":"Although evidence supports a role for inflammation in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), the mechanism remains unknown. We determined whether inflammation causes an elevated expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1) and correlated them with the symptoms.Bladder biopsies were obtained from 53 IC/BPS patients and 27 controls, and hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunostaining and Western blotting were performed to detect inflammation, TRPV1-immunoreactive and PGP9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibers, and NGF, respectively. Symptoms were assessed using the Pelvic Pain/Urgency/Frequency (PUF) questionnaire and pain visual analogue scale scores. Suburothelial nerve fiber density was quantified and correlated with PUF scores.Increased severity of inflammation was correlated with a higher TRPV1-immunoreactive nerve fiber density (r = 0.4113, p = 0.0024) and higher NGF levels (r = 0.3775, p = 0.0052). Suburothelial TRPV1-immunoreactive nerve fiber density was significantly correlated with pain scores and urgency scores (r = 0.3320, p = 0.0145 and r = 0.3823, p = 0.0039, respectively). PGP9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibers were significantly increased in IC/BPS (p = 0.0193) and had a positive relationship with inflammation severity (r = 0.6138, p < 0.0001).Our study revealed increased severity of inflammation correlated with a higher expression of TRPV1-immunoreactive nerve fibers and NGF in IC/BPS and correlated with clinical symptoms.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male
