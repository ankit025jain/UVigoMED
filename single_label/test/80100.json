{"id":80100,"title":"[Assessment of risk factors of schistosomiasis transmission control in Jingzhou City].","abstract":"To understand the key risk factors of schistosomiasis transmission in Jingzhou City, so as to provide the evidence for improving the treatment of these risk factors.Each village of six counties was investigated and 3 environments were surveyed each village for the distribution of Oncomelania snails and animal stools in the field. The results were analyzed and the risk factors of schistosomiasis transmission were assessed.The density of living snails was 0.43 snails per 0.1 m2, the frequency of the frames with snails was 9.12%, and no schistosome infected snails were found. All of the animal stools collected from the field were from bovines. The schistosome positive rate of animal stools was 37.50% (3/8) among the environments, and the schistosome infection rate of stools was 8.11% (3/37). The schistosome infection rate of animal stools was 0 near the residence living sites, and the positive rates were 12.50% and 8.33% in the ditches and slopes, respectively (chi2 = 0.07, P > 0.05).Bovine is still the main infectious source of schistosomiasis, i.e. the main risk factor of the disease transmission. Therefore, the strategy of controlling bovine should be strengthened.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800579","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.889968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.598854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.350039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.218455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.168627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.150927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.126504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Jingzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingzhou"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"337","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/337"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Ditch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditch"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"M2 (TV channel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
