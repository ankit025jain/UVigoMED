{"id":38722,"title":"The comparative effectiveness of ventricular shunt placement versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy for initial treatment of hydrocephalus in infants.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of CSF diversion with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) versus shunt therapy in infants with hydrocephalus.The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 5416 infants 1 year of age or younger with hydrocephalus (congenital or acquired) in whom CSF diversion was performed using either ETV or shunt placement at 41 children's hospitals between 2004 and 2009. Data were obtained from the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Surgical failure was defined as the need for a repeat diversion operation within 1 year of initial surgery. The authors compared failure rates of ETV and shunt, as well as patient demographics and clinical characteristics, using hierarchical regression according to treatment group.During the period examined, 872 infants (16.1%) initially underwent ETV and 4544 (83.9%) underwent ventricular shunt placement. The median infant age was 37 days (IQR 11-122 days) for both ETV and shunt placement. More infants who underwent ETV rather than shunt placement were born prematurely (41.6% vs 23.9%, respectively; p < 0.01) and had intraventricular hemorrhage (45.4% vs 17.5%, respectively; p < 0.01). Higher operative failure rates at 1 year were observed in infants who underwent ETV as opposed to shunt surgery (64.5% vs 39.6%, respectively; OR 2.9 [95% CI 2.3-3.5], p < 0.01). After controlling for prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, and spina bifida, ETV remained associated with a higher risk of failure (OR 2.6 [95% CI 2.1-3.2]).In infants with hydrocephalus, a greater 1-year CSF diversion failure rate may occur after ETV compared with shunt placement. This risk is most significant for procedures performed within the first 90 days of life. Further investigation of the need for multiple reoperations, cost, and impact of surgeon and hospital experience is necessary to distinguish which treatment is more effective in the long term.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24404970","annotations":[{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Spina bifida","weight":0.874117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.748652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.406998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.394691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraventricular_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.297581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
