{"id":69757,"title":"Feasibility of tomotherapy for postoperative irradiation of lower extremity sarcomas.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of helical tomotherapy-based image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) following surgery for lower extremity sarcoma.A retrospective review of three patients undergoing postoperative irradiation with tomotherapy for lower extremity sarcoma was conducted. Planning target volume (PTV) coverage, acute side effects, long-term complications and functional results were assessed.Tomotherapy allows adequate coverage of the PTV without an excessive radiation dose to the normal adjacent structures. Radiotherapy side effects were acceptable with no treatment breaks. All patients were disease free with no complications and no impairment of their daily activity at the last follow-up.IGRT delivered by tomotherapy may be ideally suited for sarcoma of the extremities because of its ability to achieve a high radiation dose along with excellent normal tissue sparing. Further prospective studies should be conducted to confirm this hypothesis.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296598","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.729883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.641002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.579425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.277511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pakistan Television Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Television_Corporation"},{"name":"Tomotherapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomotherapy"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"List of grape diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_diseases"},{"name":"Image-guided radiation therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-guided_radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
