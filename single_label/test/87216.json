{"id":87216,"title":"Proapoptotic Bim regulates antigen-specific NK cell contraction and the generation of the memory NK cell pool after cytomegalovirus infection.","abstract":"Apoptosis is critical for the elimination of activated lymphocytes after viral infection. Proapoptotic factor Bim (Bcl2l11) controls T lymphocyte contraction and the formation of memory T cells after infection. Natural killer (NK) cells also undergo antigen-driven expansion to become long-lived memory cells after mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection; therefore, we examined the role of Bim in regulating the MCMV-driven memory NK cell pool. Despite responding similarly early after infection, Bcl2l11(-/-) Ly49H(+) NK cells show impaired contraction and significantly outnumber wild-type (WT) cells after the expansion phase. The inability to reduce the effector pool leads to a larger Bcl2l11(-/-) NK memory subset, which displays a less mature phenotype (CD11b(lo), CD27(+)) and lower levels of NK cell memory-associated markers KLRG1 and Ly6C. Bcl2l11(-/-) memory NK cells demonstrate a reduced response to m157-mediated stimulation and do not protect as effectively as WT memory NK cells in an MCMV challenge model. Thus, Bim-mediated apoptosis drives selective contraction of effector NK cells to generate a pool of mature, MCMV-specific memory cells.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24958849","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.881128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.875095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.850087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Memory T cell","weight":0.737009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.674322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.569644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.419099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"CD27","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD27"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bim"},{"name":"Alfa Romeo 6C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_6C"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Light-year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
