{"id":27617,"title":"The role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ischemic heart disease.","abstract":"Over the last decade, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has emerged as a powerful non-invasive imaging modality with pivotal role in the evaluation and management of patients with coronary artery disease. In particular, it quantifies ventricular function, detects myocardial ischemia and scar, visualizes myocardial edema and hemorrhage. CMR provides high resolution images that are not limited by acoustic window, and without the use of radiation or iodine contrast, hence being an attractive alternative to other non-invasive modalities. In this paper we present four different cases illustrating the role of CMR in the diagnosis of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, how it provides prognostic information and may guide or alter the management.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011368","annotations":[{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.826405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Myocardial ischemia","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_ischemia"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.321944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
