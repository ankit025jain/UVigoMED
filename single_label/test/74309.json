{"id":74309,"title":"O-GlcNAcylation regulates cancer metabolism and survival stress signaling via regulation of the HIF-1 pathway.","abstract":"The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway elevates posttranslational addition of O-linked ?-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on intracellular proteins. Cancer cells elevate total O-GlcNAcylation by increasing O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and/or decreasing O-GlcNAcase (OGA) levels. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation inhibits oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation regulates glycolysis in cancer cells via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1?) and its transcriptional target GLUT1. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation increases ?-ketoglutarate, HIF-1 hydroxylation, and interaction with von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), resulting in HIF-1? degradation. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in cancer cells results in activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cancer cell apoptosis mediated through C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). HIF-1? and GLUT1 are critical for OGT-mediated regulation of metabolic stress, as overexpression of stable HIF-1 or GLUT1 rescues metabolic defects. Human breast cancers with high levels of HIF-1? contain elevated OGT, and lower OGA levels correlate independently with poor patient outcome. Thus, O-GlcNAcylation regulates cancer cell metabolic reprograming and survival stress signaling via regulation of HIF-1?.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857547","annotations":[{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.903743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.86885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Posttranslational modification","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.682928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.667078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.646613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.642772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"GLUT1","weight":0.585512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLUT1"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.473272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.44769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.444226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.403118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.222361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Alpha-Ketoglutaric acid","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Ketoglutaric_acid"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
