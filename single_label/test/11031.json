{"id":11031,"title":"Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type: clinical state of the art.","abstract":"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a late-onset, sporadic neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by autonomic failure and either poorly levodopa-responsive parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia. It is neuropathologically defined by widespread and abundant central nervous system ?-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions and striatonigral and/or olivopontocerebellar neurodegeneration. There are two clinical subtypes of MSA distinguished by the predominant motor features: the parkinsonian variant (MSA-P) and the cerebellar variant (MSA-C). Despite recent progress in understanding the pathobiology of MSA, investigations into the symptomatology and natural history of the cerebellar variant of the disease have been limited. MSA-C presents a unique challenge to both clinicians and researchers alike. A key question is how to distinguish early in the disease course between MSA-C and other causes of adult-onset cerebellar ataxia. This is a particularly difficult question, because the clinical framework for conceptualizing and studying sporadic adult-onset ataxias continues to undergo flux. To date, several investigations have attempted to identify clinical features, imaging, and other biomarkers that may be predictive of MSA-C. This review presents a clinically oriented overview of our current understanding of MSA-C with a focus on evidence for distinguishing MSA-C from other sporadic, adult-onset ataxias.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615754","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple system atrophy","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_system_atrophy"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.813393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.389038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.346553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.281977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.213163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.168115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Inclusion body","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_body"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Pure autonomic failure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_autonomic_failure"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
