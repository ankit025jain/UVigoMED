The patients in the control group received the conventional nursing, while the patients in the experimental group received the conventional nursing plus other interventions such as the health education, psychological counseling and diet guidance. The complications and scores of life quality of the patients in the 2 groups were observed and compared.The awareness of knowledge about the disease improved from 67.7% to 98.9%, the incidence of complications decreased from 28.3% to 13.3%, and the scores of life quality improved significantly in the experimental group, which were much better than those in the control group.The nursing intervention on the quality of life of patients with advanced schistosomiasis is effective.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490369","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.600491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.548184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.496338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
