{"id":84108,"title":"Measuring agreement between cervical vertebrae and hand-wrist maturation in determining skeletal age: reassessing the theory in patients with short stature.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the degree of agreement between hand-wrist radiography and cervical vertebral maturation analysis in patients diagnosed with short stature.A cross-sectional study was designed; 178 patients (90 girls, 88 boys) diagnosed with short stature and seeking treatment were selected. The patients were divided into 2 groups (76 with familial short stature, 102 with nonfamilial short stature). Hand-wrist and lateral cephalometric radiographs were obtained from the patients. The hand-wrist radiographs were analyzed using the Fishman method, and the lateral cephalometric views were categorized according to the method of Hassel and Farman. The degree of agreement between the 2 methods of predicting skeletal maturation was measured by calculating the contingency coefficient and the weighted kappa statistic.A high degree of agreement was observed between the 2 methods of analyzing skeletal maturation. It was also observed that agreement was higher in girls in the familial short-stature group, whereas boys had higher agreement in the nonfamilial short-stature group.Cervical vertebral maturation can be a valuable substitute for hand-wrist radiography in patients with short stature.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25172251","annotations":[{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.839211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.628222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.19474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone age","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_age"},{"name":"Cohen's kappa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen's_kappa"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Jon Fishman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Fishman"},{"name":"Short stature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stature"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Kappa (folklore)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Farman Aviation Works","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farman_Aviation_Works"},{"name":"Contingency (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_(philosophy)"}]}
