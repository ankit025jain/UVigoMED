{"id":70776,"title":"[Clinical classification and selection of surgical approaches for cervical spinal dumbbell tumors].","abstract":"To explore the clinical classification and selection of surgical approaches for cervical spinal dumbbell tumors.The clinical data of 87 patients with cervical spinal dumbbell tumors undergoing surgical operations from January 2005 to December 2012 at our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. According to the size of inner and outer parts of tumors and the presence or absence of spinal bone damage, the cervical spinal dumbbell tumors were divided into 4 types of intraspinal predominant (I, n = 48), extraspinal predominant (II, n = 1), intrapinal and extraspinal without damage of spinal bone (III, n = 15) and intrapinal and extraspinal type with damage of spinal bone (IV, n = 7). Different surgical approaches were selected on the basis of tumor classification: posterior median-hemilamina approaches for type I tumors, lateral-muscle gap approaches for type II tumors, ateral-muscle gap-hemilamina or lateral-muscle gap-posterior median-hemilamina approaches for type III tumors, posterior far lateral-muscle gap-hemilamina or posterior median-muscle gap-hemilamina approaches plus posterior occipital cervical or cervical spinal bone graft fusion and internal fixation for type IV tumors.Among them, 83 cases underwent total resection and another 4 subtotal resection in one-stage operation. The postoperative follow-up period had a range of 9 months to 6 years (mean, 3.2 years). There was no recurrence of tumors for total resection and 1 case of tumor recurrence for subtotal resection. During the follow-up period, the clinical manifestations of 85 patients improved while another 2 deteriorated. And there was no occurrence of spinal deformity.Clinical classification of cervical spinal dumbbell tumor plays an important guiding role in the selection of surgical approaches. Adopting appropriate surgical approaches based on tumor type can not only improve the rate of total resection of tumor but also reduce the incidence of postoperative spinal deformity.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25143159","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.66808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.597149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.513739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.498473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.374566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.307916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.188079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.0506369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dumbbell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbbell"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Occipital lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
