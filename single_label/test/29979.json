{"id":29979,"title":"Paradoxical severe agitation induced by add-on high-doses quetiapine in schizo-affective disorder.","abstract":"We report the case of a 35-year-old patient suffering from schizo-affective disorder since the age of 19 years, treated by a combination of first-generation antipsychotics, zuclopenthixol (100 mg/day) and lithium (1200 mg/day) (serum lithium=0.85 mEq/l). This patient had no associated personality disorder (particularly no antisocial disorder) and no substance abuse disorder. Within the 48 h following the gradual introduction of quetiapine (up to 600 mg/day), the patient presented severe agitation without an environmental explanation, contrasting with the absence of a history of aggressiveness or personality disorder. The diagnoses of manic shift and akathisia were dismissed. The withdrawal and the gradual reintroduction of quetiapine 2 weeks later, which led to another severe agitation, enabled us to attribute the agitation specifically to quetiapine.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582773","annotations":[{"name":"Akathisia","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akathisia"},{"name":"Schizoaffective disorder","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Antisocial personality disorder","weight":0.750443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Personality disorder","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder"},{"name":"Psychomotor agitation","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Lithium","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"},{"name":"Mania","weight":0.550959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania"},{"name":"Quetiapine","weight":0.543186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.40129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.346522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Zuclopenthixol","weight":0.135579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuclopenthixol"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Environmentalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
