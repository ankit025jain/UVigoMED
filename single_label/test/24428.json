{"id":24428,"title":"[Relationship between visceral diseases and oral health].","abstract":"The paper analyzes the literature showing that there is not only a phylogenetic relationship, but also a functional one between visceral diseases and oral health. It gives data on the unity of the occurrence of somatic and dental diseases. There is evidence for cause-and-effect relationships between them, which arise from immune imbalance, interleukin dysregulation, and nonspecific inresistance. There was a negative comorbidity of visceral diseases and oral health, namely, a relationship of dental diseases to the patients' general condition, as well as the impact of the foci of chronic oral infection on the development of systemic diseases. Mechanisms of a relationship between oral infection and secondary systemic manifestations are also described. It has been established that transient bacteremia odontogenic is detected at a dental visit and conditions for its transformation to any infectious diseases are also outlined. Unified systems approaches to treating polymorbidity are found to be needed.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437230","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.934224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.733822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.468348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.215641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0176724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
