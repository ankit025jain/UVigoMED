{"id":20222,"title":"Locoregional multiple nodular panniculitis induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa without septicemia: three cases and focus on predisposing factors.","abstract":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced locoregional multiple nodular panniculitis without septicemia is an underreported condition, with only 3 cases reported to date. We report 3 new cases of P aeruginosa-induced multiple nodular panniculitis without septicemia and describe common features among all 6 cases, thus providing the first description, to our knowledge, of the natural history and potential predisposing factors for this entity.Median age of the 6 patients was 74 years (range, 54-84 years). Patients had inflammatory nodules on a lower limb (n?=?6) that were unilateral (n?=?6) and had no fever (n?=?5). Blood cultures were negative (n?=?5). Skin biopsy specimens revealed panniculitis (n?=?5), with skin cultures positive for P aeruginosa (n?=?6). Skin nodules resolved with systemic antibiotics (n?=?5). The comorbidities recorded were type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (n?=?5), overweight (n?=?3), and combined locoregional anatomical changes in the lower limbs (n?=?5). Local skin injury, which constituted the portal entry, was present in all cases, especially leg ulcers (n?=?3).We describe P aeruginosa-induced locoregional nodular panniculitis as a distinct entity. This should be investigated in elderly, diabetic, overweight patients with inflammatory nodules on a lower limb associated with locoregional anatomical changes and skin injury, with the optimal antibiotic regimen introduced as rapidly as possible.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671612","annotations":[{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.666623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.65588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.612303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.520011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.335804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Venous ulcer","weight":0.283688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_ulcer"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Panniculitis","weight":0.189562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panniculitis"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.171578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.15708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"}]}
