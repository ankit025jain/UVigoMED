{"id":67870,"title":"Development and cultural adaptation of the Spanish version of the End Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire (SESRD-AQ).","abstract":"We previously developed and validated the End-Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ) to measure adherence behaviors (e.g., hemodialysis attendance, medication use, fluid restrictions, and diet) of patients on maintenance hemodialysis. To determine whether the ESRD-AQ can be used to measure adherence behaviors in non-English-speaking patients, we translated and adapted the ESRD-AQ into Spanish (SESRD-AQ) using forward and backward translation and cultural adaptation of the content. Validity and reliability were measured using item-level content validity indexes, intraclass correlation coefficients, and known-group analysis. All validity indices were within an acceptable range; strong test-retest stability existed across all items, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82 to 1.00. The developed SESRD-AQ is a valid assessment tool for use among Spanish-speaking patients on maintenance hemodialysis. This instrument refinement and validation process can be replicated with other maintenance hemodialysis population groups.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579396","annotations":[{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.753549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.451689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Content validity","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_validity"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.288651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.243552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.222846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.16486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.0389337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Stage (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(theatre)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
