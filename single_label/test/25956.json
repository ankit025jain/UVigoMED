{"id":25956,"title":"[Pathophysiology and classification of thrombosis].","abstract":"Hemostasis is one of the most important process of physiology for human to live, in which hemostatic factors such as platelets and coagulation factors play an important role. On the other hand, thrombosis is often defined as a critical pathophysiology represented by myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and pulmonary embolism, in which hemostatic factors also play a key part. Thus, these hemostatic factors have role in both good and bad aspects. Thrombosis is marked by sudden onset, irreversible dysfunction and recurrence, and classified to arterial and venous thromboses. The former is characterized by thrombus formation under fast blood flow, platelet activation, thrombus consisting most platelet and effectively treated by antiplatelet agents. The latter is characterized by thrombus formation under slow blood flow, coagulation activation, thrombus consisting most fibrin and effectively treated by anticoagulant agents. The classification of thrombosis is useful to choose appropriate therapy.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163306","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Cerebral infarction","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.701223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.590524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.523873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.232071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
