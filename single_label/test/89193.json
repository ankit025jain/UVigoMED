{"id":89193,"title":"Pressure autoregulation monitoring and cerebral perfusion pressure target recommendation in patients with severe traumatic brain injury based on minute-by-minute monitoring data.","abstract":"In severe traumatic brain injury, a universal target for cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) has been abandoned. Attempts to identify a dynamic CPP target based on the patient's cerebrovascular autoregulatory capacity have been promising so far. Bedside monitoring of pressure autoregulatory capacity has become possible by a number of methods, Czosnyka's pressure reactivity index (PRx) being the most frequently used. The PRx is calculated as the moving correlation coefficient between 40 consecutive 5-second averages of intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) values. Plotting PRx against CPP produces a U-shaped curve in roughly two-thirds of monitoring time, with the bottom of this curve representing a CPP range corresponding with optimal autoregulatory capacity (CPPopt). In retrospective series, keeping CPP close to CPPopt corresponded with better outcomes. Monitoring of PRx requires high-frequency signal processing. The aim of the present study is to investigate how the processing of the information on cerebrovascular pressure reactivity that can be obtained from routine minute-by-minute ICP and MABP data can be enhanced to enable CPPopt recommendations that do not differ from those obtained by the PRx method, show the same associations with outcome, and can be generated in more than two-thirds of monitoring time.The low-frequency autoregulation index (LAx) was defined as the moving minute-by-minute ICP/MABP correlation coefficient calculated over time intervals varying from 3 to 120 minutes. The CPPopt calculation was based on LAx-CPP plots and done for time windows between 1 and 24 hours and for each LAx type. The resulting matrix of CPPopts were then averaged in a weighted manner, with the weight based on the goodness of fit of a U-shape and the lower value of the LAx corresponding to the U-bottom, to result in a final CPPopt recommendation. The association between actual CPP/CPPopt and outcome was assessed in the multicenter Brain Monitoring with Information Technology Research Group (BrainIT) database (n = 180). In the Leuven-TÃ¼bingen database (60-Hz waveform data, n = 21), LAx- and PRx-based CPPopts were compared.In the BrainIT database, CPPopt recommendations were generated in 95% of monitoring time. Actual CPP being close to LAx-based CPPopt was associated with increased survival. In a multivariate model using the Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) model as covariates, the average absolute difference between actual CPP and CPPopt was independently associated with increased mortality. In the high-frequency data set no significant difference was observed between PRx-based and LAx-based CPPopts. The new method issued a CPPopt recommendation in 97% of monitoring time, as opposed to 44% for PRx-based CPPopt.Minute-by-minute ICP/MABP data contain relevant information for autoregulation monitoring. In this study, the authors' new method based on minute-by-minute data resolution allowed for CPPopt calculation in nearly the entire monitoring time. This will facilitate the use of pressure reactivity monitoring in all ICUs.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Wounds and
