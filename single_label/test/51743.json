{"id":51743,"title":"Effects of diabetes mellitus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a systematic review.","abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable motor neuron degenerative disease which onset and course may be affected by concurrent diabetes mellitus (DM). We performed a systematic review to assess the effect of DM/dysglycemic states on ALS.We searched PubMed MEDLINE, from inception to March 2013 for original articles published in English and in French languages on DM (and related states) and ALS. We made no restriction per study designs.Seven studies/1410 citations (5 case-control and 2 cross-sectional) were included in the final selection. The number of participants with ALS ranged from 18 to 2371. The outcome of interest was ALS and DM/dysglycemic states respectively in three and two case control-studies. DM/impaired glucose tolerance status did not affect disease progression, survival, disease severity and disease duration in ALS participants but ALS participants with DM were found to be older in one study. DM/IGT prevalence was similar in both ALS and non ALS participants. This review was limited by the absence of prospective cohort studies and the heterogeneity in ALS and DM diagnosis criteria.This systematic review suggests that evidences for the association of ALS and DM are rather limited and derived from cross-sectional studies. Prospective studies supplemented by ALS registries and animal studies are needed to better understand the relationship between both conditions.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661645","annotations":[{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.536528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"France","weight":0.40545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.38797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.374715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.300363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.237942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.170811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"1410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1410"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"24th century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_century"},{"name":"Languages of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_France"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Citation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
