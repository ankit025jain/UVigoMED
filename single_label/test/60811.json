{"id":60811,"title":"Role of new drugs incorporated into consolidation and maintenance therapy in transplant-eligible multiple myeloma patients.","abstract":"Since in multiple myeloma (MM) patients the depth of response achieved with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) seems to correlate with the time to progression, various strategies have been undertaken to control disease and improve prognosis. Novel agents thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide that have allowed deeper responses to be achieved in the induction phase have been tested following the ASCT as consolidation and maintenance treatments.Consolidation is generally a short-term treatment and aims to increase the depth of the response achieved with high-dose melphalan, whereas maintenance therapy consists of protracted therapy of either a fixed duration or until response and has the goal of prolonging duration of the first response. The goals of both treatments are the extension of progression-free survival and, hopefully, overall survival. This editorial will focus on the consolidation and maintenance strategies after ASCT for the treatment of MM.The incorporation of new drugs into the continuum of MM care resulted in improved outcomes and long-term disease control. However, optimal consolidation and maintenance strategies are still to be defined in the light of newer drugs to be utilized for induction strategies.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819321","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.7371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.72372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.576103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.454506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.440035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.369179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Melphalan","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melphalan"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.203677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0485315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Editorial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Term of office","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_of_office"}]}
