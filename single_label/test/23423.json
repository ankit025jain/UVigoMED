{"id":23423,"title":"Desulfovibrio desulfuricans bacteremia in a patient hospitalized with acute cerebral infarction: case report and review.","abstract":"Desulfovibrio spp. can be found in soil, water, and sewage, as well as in the digestive tracts of animals and humans. We report a case of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans bacteremia during hospitalization with acute cerebral infarction following aspiration bronchopneumonia and severe diarrhea, and the case strongly suggests that Desulfovibrio spp. bacteremia can occur as an infection due to disturbance of endogenous gut flora including antibiotic administration. Because Desulfovibrio spp. is difficult to detect in short-time incubation, its bacteremia is possibly overlooked in hospitalized patients. A few clinical cases of D.Â desulfuricans bacteremia have been reported in Japan, and they are reviewed briefly in this article.
