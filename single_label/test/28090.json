{"id":28090,"title":"The effects of ethnic, social and cultural factors on axis I comorbidity of bipolar disorder: results from the clinical setting in Korea.","abstract":"Ethnic, social and cultural factors contribute to axis I comorbid conditions in bipolar disorder (BPD). Korea has strict laws against illicit drugs and a relatively permissive prevailing attitude toward alcohol. The present study aimed to explore the lifetime axis I comorbidity rate in patients with BPD in Korea.Clinically stable patients with bipolar I (n=222) and bipolar II (n=194) disorders were recruited from four tertiary medical centers in Korea. The subjects? diagnoses and axis I comorbid conditions were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) and the Korean version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (K-DIGS). The lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and eating disorders was explored. The prevalence of these axis I comorbid conditions was compared with data from prior studies in other countries and to data concerning the general Korean population.A total of 45.1% of all subjects had at least one axis I comorbid condition. Anxiety disorders (30.2%) were the most common comorbidity, followed by alcohol use disorders (16.8%). Males with BPD showed a higher rate of alcohol dependence compared to the general male population and females with BPD showed a greater risk of having alcohol use disorder compared to the general female population. The rate of drug use disorder was extremely low (1.7%), and only one subject had an illicit-drug-related problem.Cross-sectional studies.Comorbid conditions of Korean patients with BPD showed a distinct pattern, which is associated with the ethnic, social and cultural characteristics in Korea.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012440","annotations":[{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.861801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.785924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.655443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.652616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.625582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.623117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bipolar I disorder","weight":0.560642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_I_disorder"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Bipolar II disorder","weight":0.541265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.531695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Axis I","weight":0.531539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_I"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"}]}
