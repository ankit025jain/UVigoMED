{"id":80108,"title":"[Surveillance of schistosomiasis japonica in potential endemic areas in Hubei Province from 2008 to 2012].","abstract":"To explore the potential key risk factors of schistosomiasis transmission in potential endemic areas so as to provide the evidence for setting up the prediction and surveillance systems of schistosomiasis outbreak epidemic.From 2008 to 2012, fixed and mobile surveillance sites in potential endemic areas of 2 counties in Hubei Province were selected. The immunological assays and stool examinations were carried out to investigate the schistosome infection situation of local people, mobile population and livestock. The distribution of Oncomelania hupensis snails was investigated in risk areas and suspicious areas, and spreading patterns of snails were observed in the rivers that directly connected with the Yangtze River.A total of 6 052 local people aged 6-65 years were screened by IHA immunological tests, and the positive rate of antibody was 1.19% (72/6 052). Totally 72 antibody positives were examined by Kato-Katz technique and there were no positives. A total of 5 004 mobile persons were tested by IHA immunological tests and the positive rate was 1.36% (68/5 004). Totally 68 antibody positives were examined by Kato-Katz technique and there were no positives. Totally 287.07 hm2 potential endemic areas were investigated for Oncomelania snail detection, and no snails were found. The investigation on snail spreading patterns and the surveillance on suspicious circumstances were carried out, with no snails found.In the schistosomiasis potential endemic areas, some positives of IHA immunological tests are found. Therefore, monitoring is still needed to be strengthened.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800567","annotations":[{"name":"Yangtze River","weight":0.901818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.889968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.794734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.612421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.523585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.456013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.364669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"River","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"685","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/685"},{"name":"726","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/726"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Imperial Household Agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Household_Agency"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Burglar alarm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglar_alarm"},{"name":"Japanese rice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rice"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Provinces of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Counties of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"}]}
