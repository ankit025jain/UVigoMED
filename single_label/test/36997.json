{"id":36997,"title":"Cognitive impairment in native Chinese with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.","abstract":"Previous studies have shown cognitive impairment in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). However, there is a lack of data on Chinese patients with SCA3.We investigated 22 native Chinese with SCA3 and 18 controls matched for age, education as well as mental status. Cognitive assessments were carefully carried out to measure verbal fluency, memory, attention, executive function, visuospatial and visuoconstructive functions.The most common impairments of cognition in native Chinese with SCA3 were disruption of phonemic verbal fluency and frontal executive dysfunction. Deficits in semantic fluency were detected in about 31.8% patients. Impaired visuospatial function and verbal memory were also found in native Chinese with SCA3. The degree of ataxia, CAG repeat length and education were found to correlate with cognitive performance. Multivariate binary logistic regression suggested that an oculomotor disorder and depression are predictors of cognitive impairment.Native Chinese with SCA3 had cognitive impairment of frontal executive function, temporal and parietal functions. An oculomotor disorder might be an index of cognitive dysfunction.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525517","annotations":[{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Executive functions","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.737494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Semantics","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"},{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.717878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Mental status examination","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_status_examination"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar ataxia","weight":0.650925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_ataxia"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.581421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.581374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.507853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.369971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Executive dysfunction","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Spatial-temporal reasoning","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial-temporal_reasoning"},{"name":"Phoneme","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme"},{"name":"Fluency","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluency"},{"name":"Verbal memory","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_memory"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Oculomotor nerve","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculomotor_nerve"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
