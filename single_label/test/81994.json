{"id":81994,"title":"Progress towards personalized medicine for ameloblastoma.","abstract":"Ameloblastoma is a locally infiltrative benign odontogenic neoplasm. Tumours may be large, destructive and recurrent, requiring radical surgery with associated facial deformity and morbidity. The molecular pathogenesis of this tumour has been unclear, retarding the development of non-invasive gene-targeted therapies. In a recent paper in this journal, Kurppa et al. [4] showed that EGFR-targeted therapy blocked cell proliferation in an ameloblastoma primary cell culture. That this therapy was not effective in another primary cell culture led to the discovery of the oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation in a high proportion (63%) of ameloblastoma samples. By defining two separate pathways, both of which can be specifically targeted, these findings are an important step towards personalized medicine of ameloblastoma. We discuss the findings in the broader context of ameloblastoma, as well as the effects of tumour microenvironment and molecular heterogeneity that need to be taken into account when considering the use of personalized therapies based on specific genetic mutations in individual patients.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749150","annotations":[{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.647847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.514079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.466591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.26538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Ameloblastoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameloblastoma"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0217977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Scientific journal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
