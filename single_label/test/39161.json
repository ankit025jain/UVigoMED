{"id":39161,"title":"[Determination of the pancreatic inflammatory process activity in chronic pancreatitis].","abstract":"There were 21 patients examined, who suffered chronic pancreatitis (CHP) in different activity of pancreatic inflammatory process. In the blood serum the contents of the inflammation markers was determined: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), ratio TNF-alpha/IL-10 was calculated, as well as activity of elastase in feces. Analysis of these indices permits to estimate the activity of pancreatic inflammatory process in patients, suffering CHP, what secures rising of the preoperative diagnosis and treatment efficacy, as well as reduction of intra- and postoperative complications rate.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252403","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.677403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.654771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.484677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Elastase","weight":0.371104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastase"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Republican People's Party (Turkey)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_People's_Party_(Turkey)"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
