{"id":30662,"title":"Risk factors for alcohol relapse after liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis in Japan.","abstract":"Alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) is an established indication for liver transplantation (LT). Most LT procedures in Japan are living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) because of an extreme shortage of deceased donors. Social circumstances enabling LDLT could be favorable for preventing relapse. The aims of this retrospective study were to analyze the outcomes of LDLT for ALC and to evaluate risk factors for relapse in this cohort. One hundred ninety-five subjects underwent LT [LDLT (n = 187), deceased donor LT (n = 5), or domino LT (n = 3)] for ALC in Japan from November 1997 to December 2011. Risk factors for alcohol relapse and the impact of relapse on outcomes were analyzed for 140 patients after the exclusion of 26 patients who died in the hospital and 29 patients without information about alcohol relapse. The incidence of alcohol consumption after LT was 22.9%. The risk factors for patient survival were a donor age ? 50 years (P < 0.01) and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score ? 19 (P = 0.03). The 10-year patient survival rates were 21.9% and 73.8% for patients who had relapsed and patients who had not relapsed 18 months after LT, respectively (P = 0.01). The relapse rates were 50.0%, 34.5%, 13.3%, 19.7%, and 14.3% for patients who had received livers from parents, siblings, spouses, sons/daughters, and deceased or domino donors, respectively. A history of treatment for psychological diseases other than alcoholism before LT was a significant indicator for the risk of recidivism (P = 0.02), and noncompliance with clinic visits after LT and smoking after transplantation were promising indicators for the risk of recidivism (P = 0.06, and P = 0.05, respectively). Preoperative alcohol consumption was not a risk factor. In conclusion, rather than selecting patients on the basis of preoperative alcohol use, we should provide sociomedical support to improve adherence after LT for ALC in Japan.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470014","annotations":[{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.610968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.561754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.537029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.420056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.34725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"History","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Living donor liver transplantation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_donor_liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Long-term effects of alcohol","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"}]}
