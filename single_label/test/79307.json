{"id":79307,"title":"Middle ear gentamicin-soaked pledgets in the treatment of Ménière's disease.","abstract":"Assess the relative efficacy and results of the round window hyaluronic acid pledget depot method for intratympanic gentamicin delivery in Ménière's disease.Retrospective case review.Tertiary referral hospital.Prospective symptomatic and audiologic data were collected on 28 patients undergoing intratympanic gentamicin therapy for Ménière's disease refractory to medical treatment between 2003 and 2009.All patients had the round window membrane exposed via a tympanomeatal flap, and any adhesions were removed. Hyaluronic acid pledgets soaked in 40 mg/ml of gentamicin were then packed into the round window niche and posterior mesotympanum, and the tympanomeatal flap was replaced.Patients audiologic and vertigo symptom outcome scores were recorded at follow-up according to the AAO-HNS 1995 guidelines for reporting results in Ménière's disease.Complete or substantial improvement in vertigo (class A or B) was achieved in 88.5% (23/26) of patients. Hearing loss, defined as greater than 10 dB (PTA average at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) was noted in 12 (50%) of 24 patients including 4 patients who had developed \"dead ears\" (16%). The average hearing loss for all patients excluding the 4 patients with dead ears was 10.7 dB.Round window hyaluronic acid pledget technique used as a sustained delivery vehicle for intratympanic gentamicin treatment for Ménière's disease produces similar rates of vertigo control compared with other techniques but a greater risk of hearing loss. We would recommend the intratympanicinjection titration technique as first line for most patients.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448291","annotations":[{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.755535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.749187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.580041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.545489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.236649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.226367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.219609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Round window","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_window"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Nursing assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_assessment"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Train station","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Delivery vehicle","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_vehicle"},{"name":"Parent-Teacher Association","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
