{"id":32595,"title":"Psychodermatological aspects of atopic dermatitis.","abstract":"Psychodermatology is an evolving area of science that focuses on the interaction between the mind, skin and body. It is known that various neuroendocrine mediators - including adrenocorticotropin, ?-endorphin, catecholamines and cortisol - are produced in response to stress. The resulting increase in endogenous glucocorticoids can disrupt the skin's barrier function, leaving it vulnerable to inflammatory disorders like atopic dermatitis (AD). In turn, AD is associated with high levels of stigmatization, social withdrawal, anxiety and depression among patients and their carers. It is well known that the stress caused by AD can make the symptoms of the disease worse. Therefore, the goal of psychodermatological treatment is not only to improve the condition of the skin, but also to teach patients/carers how to cope with the disease. This requires a multifaceted approach, and time and patience, to ascertain the needs of individual patients. A multidisciplinary team that includes a dermatologist, psychiatrist and psychologist will be necessary to deliver high-quality, tailored care to patients.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930567","annotations":[{"name":"Endorphin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphin"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.822236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Psychiatrist","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.767691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Psychologist","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.594186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.551505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone","weight":0.537563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.522697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"}]}
