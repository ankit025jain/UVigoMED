{"id":74109,"title":"Limited role for histopathological examination of re-excision specimens of completely excised melanomas.","abstract":"The Dutch melanoma guideline advises to examine one central block of the re-excision scar in case of a complete primary excision. To increase the evidence for this recommendation, we re-evaluated how often residual melanoma was found in re-excision specimens of a large series of completely excised melanomas. Of 1,209 Dutch melanoma cases, pathology reports of primary excisions were reviewed. Presence of melanoma in the margins was scored. All melanomas with a complete primary excision were included and pathology reports of re-excisions were reviewed. Presence of residual melanoma in the re-excision specimen and the number of blocks were scored. Slides of re-excision specimens containing residual melanoma were reviewed. Eventually, in four out of 812 melanomas (0.5 %) with a complete primary excision, residual melanoma was found in the re-excision specimen. The free margins of the primary melanomas in these cases ranged from 0.5-3.5 mm. In one case, the margin for melanoma in situ was 0.2 mm. In <1 % of initially completely excised melanomas, residual melanoma was found in the re-excision specimen. Histopathological examination of these re-excision specimens may not be cost-efficient. Our findings even imply that a re-excision could safely be omitted in selected cases of completely excised melanomas.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24869787","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.572216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.401722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.330556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"812","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/812"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
