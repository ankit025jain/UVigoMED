{"id":18217,"title":"Do-not-resuscitate status and observational comparative effectiveness research in patients with septic shock*.","abstract":"To assess the importance of including do-not-resuscitate status in critical care observational comparative effectiveness research.Retrospective analysis.All California hospitals participating in the 2007 California State Inpatient Database, which provides do-not-resuscitate status within the first 24 hours of admission.Septic shock present at admission.None.We investigated the association of early do-not-resuscitate status with in-hospital mortality among patients with septic shock. We also examined the strength of confounding of do-not-resuscitate status on the association between activated protein C therapy and mortality, an association with conflicting results between observational and randomized studies. We identified 24,408 patients with septic shock; 19.6% had a do-not-resuscitate order. Compared with patients without a do-not-resuscitate order, those with a do-not-resuscitate order were significantly more likely to be older (75?±?14 vs 67?±?16 yr) and white (62% vs 53%), with more acute organ failures (1.44?±?1.15 vs 1.38?±?1.15), but fewer inpatient interventions (1.0?±?1.0 vs 1.4?±?1.1). Adding do-not-resuscitate status to a model with 47 covariates improved mortality discrimination (c-statistic, 0.73-0.76; p < 0.001). Addition of do-not-resuscitate status to a multivariable model assessing the association between activated protein C and mortality resulted in a 9% shift in the activated protein C effect estimate toward the null (odds ratio from 0.78 [95% CI, 0.62-0.99], p = 0.04, to 0.85 [0.67-1.08], p = 0.18).Among patients with septic shock, do-not-resuscitate status acts as a strong confounder that may inform past discrepancies between observational and randomized studies of activated protein C. Inclusion of early do-not-resuscitate status into more administrative databases may improve observational comparative effectiveness methodology.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810532","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.527887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.285477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.262155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"California","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.170536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.169459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Protein C","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_C"},{"name":"Comparative Effectiveness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_Effectiveness"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"381","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/381"},{"name":"408","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/408"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"730","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/730"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Addition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Social exclusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion"}]}
