{"id":19034,"title":"Investigation of the first outbreak of OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Ireland.","abstract":"Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) strains are encountered with increasing frequency in Europe. In November 2010 the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) graded Ireland as only having sporadic occurrence of CPE.To describe the epidemiological and molecular typing analysis of the first outbreak of OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in an Irish tertiary care referral centre.Sixteen OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were detected, from both clinical and screening specimens, and analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and by multi-locus sequence typing.Typing analysis revealed that two outbreak strains were circulating in the hospital, one among surgical patients and one among medical patients. The 'medical strain' ST13 had already been identified as an internationally disseminated clone, whereas the 'surgical strain' ST221 had not previously been reported as an OXA-48-carrying strain.Although the outbreak on surgical wards was successfully controlled by implementing strict infection control measures, intermittent detection of individual patients carrying the 'medical strain' of OXA-48 K. pneumoniae has persisted since then. The experience from this outbreak suggests that OXA-48 K. pneumoniae is endemic at low level in the healthcare setting in the Dublin region.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746608","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.609643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.540992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.528147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.485619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.429365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Dublin","weight":0.328623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.185593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.17501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Ward (country subdivision)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"}]}
