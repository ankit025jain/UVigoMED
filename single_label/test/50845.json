{"id":50845,"title":"TRIB3 alters endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced ?-cell apoptosis via the NF-?B pathway.","abstract":"To examine the effect of TRIB3 on endoplasmic reticulum stress induced ?-cell apoptosis and to investigate the mechanism with a specific emphasis on the role of NF-?B pathway.We investigated the effect of TRIB3 on ER stress-induced ?-cell apoptosis in INS-1 cells and primary rodent islets. The potential role of TRIB3 in ER stress inducer thapsigargin (Tg)-induced ?-cell apoptosis was assessed using overexpression and siRNA knockdown approaches. Inducible TRIB3 ?-cells, regulated by the tet-on system, were used for sub-renal capsule transplantation in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice, to study the effect of TRIB3 on ER stress-induced ?-cell apoptosis in vivo. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining both in vivo and in vitro, while the molecular mechanisms of NF-?B activation were investigated.TRIB3 was induced in ER-stressed INS-1 cells and rodent islets, and its overexpression was accompanied by increased ?-cell apoptosis. Specifically, TRIB3 overexpression enhanced Tg-induced INS-1 derived ?-cell apoptosis both in vitro and in sub-renal capsular transplantation animal model. Additionally, knockdown of Trib3 blocked Tg-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, the induction of TRIB3 during ER stress resulted in the activation of NF-?B and aggravated INS-1 derived ?-cell apoptosis, while inhibiting the NF-?B pathway significantly abrogated this response and prevented ?-cell apoptosis, both in vitro and in sub-renal capsular transplantation animal model.TRIB3 mediated ER stress-induced ?-cell apoptosis via the NF-?B pathway.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746137","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.900346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.725258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.705784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.686122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.580933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.482309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.413398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.366214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Inducer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inducer"},{"name":"Thapsigargin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thapsigargin"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Unfolded protein response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfolded_protein_response"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"TUNEL assay","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUNEL_assay"}]}
