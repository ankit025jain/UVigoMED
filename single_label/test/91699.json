{"id":91699,"title":"Syrian revolution: a field hospital under attack.","abstract":"Syrian revolution that began on March 15, 2011 represents not only a political crisis but also a humanitarian one where many relief attempts for saving civil injured were tried.A secret field hospital organized by the medical Arab union was set in Al-Bab town in the district of Aleppo. Egyptian volunteer physicians were the operating team who reached Syria through the Turkish border. Medical supplies were delivered from Turkey and medical equipment were taken from the government hospital which was not running at that time. Many Syrian volunteers helped in running this field hospital most of them were non-medical personnel who were trained to help in some medical purposes.Total number of cases referred to the hospital was 75. Surgical intervention was needed for 28 patients. Most common procedures needed were vascular procedures (32 percent), orthopedic procedures (32 percent), and abdominal exploration (25 percent). Median injury severity score (ISS) for admitted patients were 21 with interquartile range (14-21). Two patients died intraoperatively due to massive bleeding.Setting up a field hospital in such an area with unsafe conditions needs good communication with medical and relief organizations in the site of crisis, selection of a location as near as possible to the Turkish border, developing a convenient triaging plan, and training nonmedical volunteers to do simple tasks.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Wounds and
