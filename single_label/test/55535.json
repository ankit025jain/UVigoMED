{"id":55535,"title":"Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide as an adjuvant in the management of acute retinal necrosis.","abstract":"To determine the role of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) as an adjuvant in the management of acute retinal necrosis (ARN).Interventional case series.Four eyes of 4 patients diagnosed with ARN were studied.This pilot case series included 4 patients who presented with clinical features suggestive of ARN. IVTA was injected 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of antiviral therapy and concurrent usage of oral corticosteroids. The disease course and clinical outcome were observed. The patients received additional treatment depending on the sequelae of ARN.Signs of reduction in vitritis and resolution of retinitis were observed as early as 1 week after IVTA was administered. In all 4 patients, inflammation promptly resolved with no untoward effects like raised intraocular pressure or worsening of the retinitis. A final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was achieved in 3 of 4 patients after appropriate treatment of ARN-related complications.Intravitreal triamcinolone under antiviral cover could be a useful adjunct to systemic steroids in the treatment of ARN.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862775","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.841687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.789811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.726399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.583857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.53885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Triamcinolone acetonide","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone_acetonide"},{"name":"Triamcinolone","weight":0.270374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.247108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.163079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Acetone","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"},{"name":"Retinitis","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
