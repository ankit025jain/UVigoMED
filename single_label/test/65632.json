{"id":65632,"title":"Cardiac remodeling associated with protein increase and lipid accumulation in early-stage chronic kidney disease in rats.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac remodeling including myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy is frequently observed in CKD patients. In this study, we investigate the mechanism involved in cardiac hypertrophy associated with CKD using a rat model, by morphological and chemical component changes of the hypertrophic and non-hypertrophic hearts. Sprague-Dawley rats were 4/5 nephrectomized (Nx) at 11 weeks of age and assigned to no treatment and treatment with AST-120, which was reported to affect the cardiac damage, at 18 weeks of age. At 26 weeks of age, the rats were euthanized under anesthesia, and biochemical tests as well as analysis of cardiac condition were performed by histological and spectrophotometric methods. Cardiac hypertrophy and CKD were observed in 4/5 Nx rats even though vascular calcification and myocardial fibrosis were not detected. The increasing myocardial protein was confirmed in hypertrophic hearts by infrared spectroscopy. The absorption of amide I and other protein bands in hypertrophic hearts increased at the same position as in normal cardiac absorption. Infrared spectra also showed that lipid accumulation was also detected in hypertrophic heart. Conversely, the absorptions of protein were obviously reduced in the myocardium of non-hypertrophic heart with CKD compared to that of hypertrophic heart. The lipid associated absorption was also decreased in non-hypertrophic heart. Our results suggest that cardiac remodeling associated with relatively early-stage CKD may be suppressed by reducing increased myocardial protein and ameliorating cardiac lipid load.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Male Urogenital
