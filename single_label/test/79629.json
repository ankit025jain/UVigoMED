{"id":79629,"title":"Role of Blimp-1 in programing Th effector cells into IL-10 producers.","abstract":"Secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL) 10 by effector T cells is an essential mechanism of self-limitation during infection. However, the transcriptional regulation of IL-10 expression in proinflammatory T helper (Th) 1 cells is insufficiently understood. We report a crucial role for the transcriptional regulator Blimp-1, induced by IL-12 in a STAT4-dependent manner, in controlling IL-10 expression in Th1 cells. Blimp-1 deficiency led to excessive inflammation during Toxoplasma gondii infection with increased mortality. IL-10 production from Th1 cells was strictly dependent on Blimp-1 but was further enhanced by the synergistic function of c-Maf, a transcriptional regulator of IL-10 induced by multiple factors, such as the Notch pathway. We found Blimp-1 expression, which was also broadly induced by IL-27 in effector T cells, to be antagonized by transforming growth factor (TGF) ?. While effectively blocking IL-10 production from Th1 cells, TGF-? shifted IL-10 regulation from a Blimp-1-dependent to a Blimp-1-independent pathway in IL-27-induced Tr1 (T regulatory 1) cells. Our findings further illustrate how IL-10 regulation in Th cells relies on several transcriptional programs that integrate various signals from the environment to fine-tune expression of this critical immunosuppressive cytokine.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073792","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Toxoplasma gondii","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.741807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.725048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.712649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.678485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.62362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.508761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Notch signaling pathway","weight":0.508237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.472112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.249696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Interleukin 27","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_27"},{"name":"STAT4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT4"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
