{"id":63549,"title":"Characterization of multiple myeloma clonal cell expansion and stromal Wnt/?-catenin signaling in hyaluronic acid-based 3D hydrogel.","abstract":"Emerging interest on three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models to replace two-dimensional cultures of cancer cells and their xenografts in immunocompromised animal hosts prompted us to investigate the use of new biodegradable gels to recapitulate the physiological conditions of the microenvironment of multiple myeloma (MM) cells.In the present study, for the first time, we used a new 3D model of hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels with difference in their matrix composition and stiffness.We demonstrated that hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels perfectly accommodate MM cells; confirmed by cell survival, migration, colony forming units and expression of cell adhesion proteins of the Wnt signaling pathways over a period of time.This study provides the first 3D microenvironment data that HA-based hydrogels could provide with a suitable 3D substratum for MM cells to comprehensively analyze phenotypic changes and the influence of bone marrow stromal stem cells on Wnt/? catenin signaling in response to targeted drug treatments.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24425838","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.738424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.651962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.254924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0389337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
