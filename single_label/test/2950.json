{"id":2950,"title":"Multiaxial changes in pregnancy: mental health--a review of the literature.","abstract":"Pregnancy constitutes not only a challenge for the body of the woman, but also a developmental and psychological task for the mother-to-be, her partner and the entire family. Considerable amount of research has been published on the subject of the puerperal period and treatment options of various disorders emerging after pregnancy. However, data on psychiatric disorders and their treatment during that period, although available, remain insufficient. The paper reviews the literature on mental disorders occurring in pregnancy taking into account the overall emotional situation of the pregnant woman.","date":"2014-12-30","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546931","annotations":[{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.443164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.386317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.340413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"}]}
