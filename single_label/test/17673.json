{"id":17673,"title":"Mortality benefit of vasopressor and inotropic agents in septic shock: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","abstract":"The choice of vasopressor in septic shock has been a matter of debate. The purpose of this study was to systematically review overall evidence of vasopressor and inotropic agents in septic shock using a Bayesian network meta-analysis.Databases, including Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that reported mortality rates on the use of vasopressors and inotropes in patients with septic shock. We chose to use 28-day mortality as the outcome assessment criterion.Fourteen studies with a total of 2811 patients were included in the analysis. Norepinephrine (NE) and NE + low-dose vasopressin but not epinephrine (EPI) were associated with significantly reduced mortality compared with dopamine. (Odds ratio, 0.80 [95% credibility interval, 0.65-0.99], 0.69 [0.48-0.98], and 0.56 [0.26-1.18], respectively). The addition of an inotropic agent such as dobutamine or dopexamine did not reduce mortality compared with EPI or NE alone.Our results support the use of NE with or without low-dose vasopressin as the first-line vasopressor therapy in septic shock. No concrete evidence exists to support the use of EPI over dopamine as the second-line agent or the addition of an inotropic agent.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857641","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Vasopressin","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Sympathomimetic drug","weight":0.744072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathomimetic_drug"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.727383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.723217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.690201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.558966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Inotrope","weight":0.486111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotrope"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.39659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Bayesian network","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Dobutamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobutamine"},{"name":"Dopexamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopexamine"},{"name":"Concrete","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Bayesian probability","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Credibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credibility"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
