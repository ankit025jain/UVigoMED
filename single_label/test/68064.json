{"id":68064,"title":"[Acute kidney injury in elderly patient: Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects].","abstract":"Acute renal failure in elderly patient is a public health problem. It is worsen by physiological status and anatomical changes associated with age, polymedication and chronic diseases. The etiologies of acute renal failure in the elderly are the same as in adults. Their distribution is specific with a large proportion of obstructive acute renal failure. The diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are the same as for young adults; the injection of iodinated-contrast should be avoided. Therapeutic strategies are discussed in terms of quality of life pre-morbid. Age is not considered a determinant of intensive treatment decisions. Renal replacement therapy in the elderly is not associated with excess mortality. Prevention of acute renal failure should be a permanent concern.
