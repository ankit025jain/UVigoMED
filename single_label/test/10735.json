{"id":10735,"title":"Poor memory performance in aged cynomolgus monkeys with hippocampal atrophy, depletion of amyloid beta 1-42 and accumulation of tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid.","abstract":"Due to their similarities in behavior and disease pathology to humans, non-human primate models are desirable to complement small animals as models for the study of age-related dementia.Based on their performance on delayed response task (DRT) tests of memory, aged cynomolgus monkeys were divided into two groups to compare high-performing (n=6) and low-performing (n=6) subjects. Both groups were tested for biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease and their brains were scanned using structural magnetic resonance imaging.The subjects with poor DRT performance had evidence of atrophy in the hippocampus and cortical areas, significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta amino acid 1-42 (p<0.001) and higher cerebrospinal fluid total tau levels (p<0.05) compared to the group performing well on the DRT tests.Old, memory-impaired Cynomolgus monkeys may be useful as a spontaneous non-human primate model for investigations of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632970","annotations":[{"name":"Primate","weight":0.892969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Beta amyloid","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_amyloid"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tau protein","weight":0.783564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.757389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.632635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.150999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.140244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Crab-eating macaque","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab-eating_macaque"},{"name":"Monkey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
