{"id":14886,"title":"Bkca opener, NS1619 pretreatment protects against shock-induced vascular hyporeactivity through PDZ-Rho GEF-RhoA-Rho kinase pathway in rats.","abstract":"Our previous study showed that the ischemic preconditioning and pretreatment of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) opener, pinacidil, may induce a good protective effect on shock-induced vascular hyporeactivity. Whether the pretreatment of opener/activator of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (Bkca), NS1619, can also induce a protective effect on vascular reactivity and play a beneficial effect on subsequent hemorrhagic shock is not clear.With Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to hemorrhagic shock and their isolated superior mesenteric artery, the protective effect of NS1619 (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) pretreatment (30 minutes before hemorrhage shock) on vascular reactivity and the underlying mechanisms were observed.NS1619 pretreatment significantly improved the 72-hour survival of hemorrhagic shock rats, alleviated shock-induced decrease of vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity, and increased the cardiac output and oxygen delivery. NS1619 2 mg/kg had the best effect. These protective effects of NS1619 pretreatment on vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity were antagonized by RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase, and Rho kinase antagonist, Y-27632. NS1619 pretreatment up-regulated the activities of RhoA, Rho-kinase, and PDZ-Rho GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor). These effects of NS1619 pretreatment were eliminated by RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase.Bkca opener, NS1619 pretreatment has good protective effect on vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity, which plays a good beneficial effect on hemorrhagic shock. The mechanism may be mainly through PDZ-Rho GEF-RhoA-Rho kinase pathway. Bkca channel may be a potential target for the treatment of shock-induced vascular hyporeactivity.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398773","annotations":[{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.868238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.842257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.795292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Cardiac output","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.731501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.645513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Potassium channel","weight":0.552467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Superior mesenteric artery","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_artery"},{"name":"Rho-associated protein kinase","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho-associated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.468144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.417526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.36082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.331422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Guanine nucleotide exchange factor","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor"},{"name":"RHOA","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHOA"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Nucleotide exchange factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_exchange_factor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Rho family of GTPases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_family_of_GTPases"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
