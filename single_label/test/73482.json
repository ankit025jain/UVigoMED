{"id":73482,"title":"Refute the conclusion made by Jie et al. in \"prognostic role of microRNA-100 in various carcinomas: evidence from six studies\".","abstract":"Recently, we had the honor of reading a meta-analysis article published in Tumor Biology which was completed by Jie et al. Because of our interest in the correlations between microRNAs (miRs) and human cancer prognosis, we carefully read the entire article. Jie et al. put forward a standpoint that deregulation of miR-100 in cancerous tissues could significantly predict poor survival in various carcinomas. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was 2.19 (1.49-3.24, p?=?0.0007). The reliability of the meta-analysis is reciprocally higher than traditional and narrative reviews. Furthermore, the reliability is exclusively dependent on reference retrieval, incorporating eligible articles as comprehensive as possible, and proper and accurate data extraction. We found several critical errors in their meta-analysis, and its conclusion was unbelievable and might misguide readers. According to their statistical strategies, we also conducted a meta-analysis to reevaluate the relationship between deregulation of miR-100 and human cancer prognosis for rectification. The present studies are not powerful enough to demonstrate the prognostic role of miR-100 in human cancers, and thus, much more works are needed in this field.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903380","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.657598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.536161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.498665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.103477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Deregulation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Jie people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jie_people"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Data extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_extraction"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Mini-Con","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Con"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
