{"id":91467,"title":"[Dynamics of circulating immune complexes and immunoglobulins in response to polytrauma in experiment].","abstract":"In experimental polytrauma conditions in the blood serum the immune complexes are accumulating. The dynamics of their contents is a wave-like, the periods of increase are determined--in 3 and 21 days and reduction--in 7-14 and 28 days. Accordingly, the IgA and IgG contents are changing with characteristic significant reduction in 14 days of posttraumatic period. The IgM content reaches maximum in 1-3 days with further reduction lower than norm till the end of experiment.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502019","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.72345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.700244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.638571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.463282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.449902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.333333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Immune complex","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_complex"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Wave-particle duality","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
