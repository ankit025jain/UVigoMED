{"id":69226,"title":"Renal cell carcinoma is more aggressive in Turkish patients with the metabolic syndrome.","abstract":"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a multifactorial disease characterized by impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes, obesity, high triglyceride levels, low HDL levels, and hypertension. In this study we evaluate the relationship between tumor size and grade, and presence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with renal cell carcinoma.Between 2007-2013, radical nephrectomy was performed for 310 patients with renal tumors in our clinic and those with pathology reported renal cell carcinoma were enrolled and divided into two groups, with and without metabolic syndrome diagnosed on the basis of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. The relationship between tumor size and grade of the two groups (Fuhrman nuclear degree) was evaluated statistically.The metabolic syndrome was found in 70 patients, with a mean age of 65.5 (40-87), as compared to 58.8 (31-84) years in the non-metabolic syndrome group. Tumor size over 7 cm was found in 54% and 33%, respectively, and tumor grade over Fuhrman 3 in 56% and 32% of patients. Patients with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher tumor size and grade (p<0.05). In the presence of hypertension, diabetes and high triglyceride levels, significant assocations were again observed (p<0.05). Tumor size and degree also increased with increasing body mass index but this was not statistically significant (p>0.05).Renal cancer is more aggressive in patients with metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle and risk factors were revealed to be significant influences in renal cancer patients.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460301","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.752305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.740967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hypertriglyceridemia","weight":0.709617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertriglyceridemia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"National Cholesterol Education Program","weight":0.680422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cholesterol_Education_Program"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.639275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.308448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.116055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.0283581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
