{"id":73442,"title":"Differences in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor expression and correlation with the degree of enhancement in medulloblastoma.","abstract":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the major proangiogenic factor in many solid tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) is expressed in abundance in pediatric patients with medulloblastoma and is associated with tumor metastasis, poor prognosis, and proliferation. Gadolinium enhancement on MRI has been suggested to have prognostic significance for some tumors. The association of VEGF/VEGFR and Gd enhancement in medulloblastoma has never been closely examined. The authors therefore sought to evaluate whether Gd-enhancing medulloblastomas have higher levels of VEGFR and CD31. Outcomes and survival in patients with enhancing and nonenhancing tumors were also compared.A retrospective analysis of patients with enhancing, nonenhancing, and partially enhancing medulloblastomas was performed. Primary end points included risk stratification, extent of resection, and perioperative complications. A cohort of 3 enhancing and 3 nonenhancing tumors was selected for VEGFR and CD31 analysis as well as microvessel density measurements.Fifty-eight patients were analyzed, and 20.7% of the medulloblastomas in these patients were nonenhancing. Enhancing medulloblastomas exhibited strong VEGFR1/2 and CD31 expression relative to nonenhancing tumors. There was no significant difference in perioperative complications or patient survival between the 2 groups.These results suggest that in patients with medulloblastoma the presence of enhancement on MRI may correlate with increased vascularity and angiogenesis, but does not correlate with worse patient prognosis in the short or long term.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905841","annotations":[{"name":"Medulloblastoma","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulloblastoma"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.777237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.666691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.556504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.540273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.51758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.424516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.213585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"CD31","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD31"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
