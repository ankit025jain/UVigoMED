{"id":78218,"title":"[Skin prick test of inhalative allergens for patients with allergic rhinitis in Yichang].","abstract":"To investigate the allergens in patients with allergic rhinitis in Yichang, so that to find common allergens of Yichang and to provide statistic basis for a reasonable prevention and treatment to allergic rhinitis.1,979 patients with allergic rhinitis in Yichang were detected for allergens by skin prick test and the distribution of positive rates to inhaled allergens was compared between different genders and ages.1,545 (78.1%) of 1,979 suspected allergic rhinitis patients presented positive reaction. The positive rate in male was significantly higher than in female, and that in juvenile group was significantly higher than in adults. Among positive cases in inhalation group, the most common allergen was flour mite (80.4%), followed by house dust mite (64.9%), cockroach (13.3%) and artemisia pollen (8.2%).The study shows that the flour mite and house dust mite are the most common inhaled allergens causing allergic rhinitis in Yichang. We should pay more attention to the prevention and treatment for the juvenile patients.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738312","annotations":[{"name":"Mite","weight":0.928269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"House dust mite","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dust_mite"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.802769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Cockroach","weight":0.797944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach"},{"name":"Pollen","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.721359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Flour","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Yichang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yichang"},{"name":"Flour mite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_mite"},{"name":"Artemisia (plant)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_(plant)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/979"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"}]}
