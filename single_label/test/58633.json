{"id":58633,"title":"Robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair of a vesicovaginal fistula: a time-consuming novelty or an effective tool?","abstract":"Vesicovaginal fistulas are a rare complication of hysterectomy. When conservative therapy fails, vaginal or abdominal repair is necessary. A robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach can be a useful tool to repair complex fistulas. A 50-year-old woman with a vesicovaginal fistula located at the top of the vagina, was treated with robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair. The fistula tissue was removed from the vaginal wall and bladder, and epiploic of the sigmoid was interposed in between. The total operation time was 104?min. The hospital stay was 3?days; no complications occurred. Cystography 6?weeks and 6?months postoperative confirmed a successful repair. A review of current literature is presented regarding the application of robotic assistance during this procedure. The presented case shows that robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair of a vesicovaginal fistula seems to be a feasible technique with promising results.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916979","annotations":[{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.72001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.569041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.4372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Vesicovaginal fistula","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicovaginal_fistula"},{"name":"Cystography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystography"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Novelty song","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_song"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
