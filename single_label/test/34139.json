{"id":34139,"title":"Gait strategy in genetically obese patients: a 7-year follow up.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the change in gait and body weight in the long term in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Eight adults with PWS were evaluated at baseline and after 7 years. During this period patient participated an in- and out-patient rehabilitation programs including nutritional and adapted physical activity interventions. Two different control groups were included: the first group included 14 non-genetically obese patients (OCG: obese control group) and the second group included 10 age-matched healthy individuals (HCG: healthy control group). All groups were quantitatively assessed during walking with 3D-GA. The results at the 7-year follow-up revealed significant weight loss in the PWS group and spatial-temporal changes in gait parameters (velocity, step length and cadence). With regard to the hip joint, there were significant changes in terms of hip position, which is less flexed. Knee flexion-extension showed a reduction of flexion in swing phase and of its excursion. No changes of the ankle position were evident. As for ankle kinetics, we observed in the second session higher values for the peak of ankle power in terminal stance in comparison to the first session. No changes were found in terms of ankle kinetics. The findings demonstrated improvements associated to long-term weight loss, especially in terms of spatial-temporal parameters and at hip level. Our results back the call for early weight loss interventions during childhood, which would allow the development of motor patterns under normal body weight conditions.
