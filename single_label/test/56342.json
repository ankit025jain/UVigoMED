{"id":56342,"title":"Comparison of the visual results after SMILE and femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK for myopia.","abstract":"To perform a comparative clinical analysis of the safety, efficacy, and predictability of two surgical procedures (ie, small incision lenticule extraction [SMILE] and femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK [FS-LASIK]) to correct myopia.Sixty eyes of 31 patients with a mean spherical equivalent of -5.13 ± 1.75 diopters underwent myopia correction with the SMILE procedure. Fifty-one eyes of 27 patients with a mean spherical equivalent of -5.58 ± 2.41 diopters were treated with the FS-LASIK procedure. Postoperative uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, manifest refraction, and higher-order aberrations were analyzed statistically at 1 and 3 months postoperatively.No statistically significant differences were found at 1 and 3 months in parameters that included the percentage of eyes with an uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better (P = .556, .920) and mean spherical equivalent refraction (P = .055, .335). At 1 month, 4 SMILE-treated eyes and 1 FS-LASIK-treated eye lost one or more line of visual acuity (P = .214, chi-square test). At 3 months, 2 SMILE-treated eyes lost one or more line of visual acuity, whereas all FS-LASIK-treated eyes had an unchanged or corrected distance visual acuity. Higher-order aberrations and spherical aberration were significantly lower in the SMILE group than the FS-LASIK group at 1 (P = .007, .000) and 3 (P = .006, .000) months of follow-up.SMILE and FS-LASIK are safe, effective, and predictable surgical procedures to treat myopia. SMILE has a lower induction rate of higher-order aberrations and spherical aberration than the FS-LASIK procedure.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702576","annotations":[{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.725566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.671842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.638682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.492341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Spherical aberration","weight":0.357341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.318828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.276738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"335","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/335"},{"name":"920","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"SMILE (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILE_(magazine)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"}]}
