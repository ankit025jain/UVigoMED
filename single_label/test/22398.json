{"id":22398,"title":"[Severe pain and livid discoloration in the left leg of a 32-year-old patient after intravascular heroin injection].","abstract":"Acute leg ischemia after intra-arterial drug injection represents a critical vascular emergency scenario. Due to lack of evidence-based standards therapeutic strategies are oriented to the underlying pathomechanisms. For a sufficient therapy a close clinical monitoring and laboratory analyses as well as treatment with analgesics, anticoagulants, anti-inflammatory and spasmolytic agents are of utmost importance. This article reports on the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in a 32-year-old patient with acute leg ischemia after intra-arterial administration of heroin and secondary infection with Peptostreptococcus and Peptoniphilus species.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553770","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Muscle relaxant","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxant"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.734696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.719301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.333206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.259155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
