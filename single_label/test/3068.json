{"id":3068,"title":"[Effects of repeated short-term immobilization stress on plastisity of brain cortical division and cognition in adult rats with normal and disturbed embryogenesis].","abstract":"The aim of the work was the analysis of the changes in a number of labile synaptopodin-positi- ve dendritic spines in parietal cortex and the CA1 field of the hippocampus, which characterize plasticity of intracellular interaction, and of the memorization after short-term repeated immobili- zation stress (daily for 5 minutes, 10 days), both in control rats and in rats subjected to prenatal hypoxia (E14, 7% of O2, 3 hours). There were observed deterioration of short-term and long-term memory, decrease in number labile spines in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (for 17.3 ± 10.4%; p ? 0.05) and their increase in a molecular layer of brain parietal cortex (for 36.9 ± 9.2%) at the adult rats with normal embryogenesis after immobilization stress in comparison with control intact animals. At the rats subjected to a prenatal hypoxia, regardless of that, they were ex- posed to an immobilized stress at an adult stage or not, was noted both violation of short-term and long-term memory, and decrease in number labile spines in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (for 22.9 ± 10.5%) and parietal cortex (for 28.1 ± 9.3%). The obtained data allow to conclude that the increase of plasticity providing adaptive behavior of animals, takes place in neocortical neuronal networks as a reply to a short-term repeating stress only at normal brain formation during embryo- genesis, while, violation of embryogenesis leads to decrease in plasticity and adaptive opportuni- ties of the nervous system during further ontogenesis.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427377","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Ontogeny","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogeny"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Embryogenesis","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryogenesis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.777071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Neocortex","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.702046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.666255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Dendritic spine","weight":0.521151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_spine"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.461225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.434085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.426785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.412888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.28842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Hippocampus anatomy","weight":0.273086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus_anatomy"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.203971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Biological neural network","weight":0.146849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network"},{"name":"Lability","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lability"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Imago","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imago"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
