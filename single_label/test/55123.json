{"id":55123,"title":"General anesthesia in the pediatric population.","abstract":"This article reviews the pertinent perioperative, intraoperative, and short- and long-term postoperative risks associated with general anesthesia in children undergoing ocular surgery.Animal studies suggest an association between general anesthesia and neurodevelopmental delay; however, animal pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics do not directly correlate with human metrics. Retrospective human studies present conflicting data. Further, prospective studies in humans are underway, with projected results available within the next 3-5 years.All surgeons should be aware of current practices in pediatric anesthetic care, as well as the immediate- and long-term risks of general anesthesia. Ophthalmologists with pediatric patients should be aware of the potentially life-threatening conditions associated with general anesthesia. Additionally, the relative lifelong risks and benefits of general anesthetic exposure should be considered when recommending surgery, especially in light of the child's age, health status, and necessity of multiple anesthetic events.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991869","annotations":[{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"General anaesthetic","weight":0.688855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthetic"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.680462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.662126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.560249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.408691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.348425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.331255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Eye surgery","weight":0.132628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_surgery"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Necessity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0106373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
