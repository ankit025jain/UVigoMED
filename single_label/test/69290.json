{"id":69290,"title":"Synthesis and anti-renal fibrosis activity of conformationally locked truncated 2-hexynyl-N(6)-substituted-(N)-methanocarba-nucleosides as A3 adenosine receptor antagonists and partial agonists.","abstract":"Truncated N(6)-substituted-(N)-methanocarba-adenosine derivatives with 2-hexynyl substitution were synthesized to examine parallels with corresponding 4'-thioadenosines. Hydrophobic N(6) and/or C2 substituents were tolerated in A3AR binding, but only an unsubstituted 6-amino group with a C2-hexynyl group promoted high hA2AAR affinity. A small hydrophobic alkyl (4b and 4c) or N(6)-cycloalkyl group (4d) showed excellent binding affinity at the hA3AR and was better than an unsubstituted free amino group (4a). A3AR affinities of 3-halobenzylamine derivatives 4f-4i did not differ significantly, with Ki values of 7.8-16.0 nM. N(6)-Methyl derivative 4b (Ki = 4.9 nM) was a highly selective, low efficacy partial A3AR agonist. All compounds were screened for renoprotective effects in human TGF-?1-stimulated mProx tubular cells, a kidney fibrosis model. Most compounds strongly inhibited TGF-?1-induced collagen I upregulation, and their A3AR binding affinities were proportional to antifibrotic effects; 4b was most potent (IC50 = 0.83 ?M), indicating its potential as a good therapeutic candidate for treating renal fibrosis.
