{"id":55433,"title":"Comparison of 1-year therapeutic effect of ranibizumab and bevacizumab for myopic choroidal neovascularization: a retrospective, multicenter, comparative study.","abstract":"To compare the long-term efficacy of ranibizumab versus bevacizumab for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV).This was a retrospective, multicenter, comparative, non-randomized study of 64 consecutive patients with myopic CNV treated with ranibizumab (22 patients) or bevacizumab (42 patients). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT) on optical coherence tomography were evaluated before and after treatment. All the patients were followed for at least 12 months.BCVA (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution) improved from 0.63 ± 0.30 to 0.43 ± 0.27, 0.41 ± 0.37, 0.40 ± 0.39, 0.39 ± 0.43, and 0.39 ± 0.42 at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment in the ranibizumab group, and from 0.67 ± 0.28 to 0.52 ± 0.31, 0.49 ± 0.31, 0.47 ± 0.31, 0.42 ± 0.32, and 0.46 ± 0.43 in the bevacizumab group (all P < 0.05 compared with baseline BCVA in each group). CFT decreased by 20.21%, 19.58%, and 22.43% from the baseline 304 ± 76 ?m at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment in the former group, and by 15.20%, 15.67%, and 15.56% from the baseline 297 ± 62 ?m in the latter group (all P < 0.05 compared with baseline CFT in each group). BCVA improvement and CFT reduction did not statistically differ when compared at the same periods from treatment between 2 groups. Neither ocular nor systemic safety problems appeared during follow up.This study showed a similar functional and anatomical improvement after treatment of ranibizumab and bevacizumab for myopic CNV over a 12-month follow-up period.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884970","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.565467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.557486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.526101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.2941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.1401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.0294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"}]}
