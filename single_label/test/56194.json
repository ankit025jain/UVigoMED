{"id":56194,"title":"Inducing a visceral organ to protect a peripheral capillary bed: stabilizing hepatic HIF-1? prevents oxygen-induced retinopathy.","abstract":"Activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) can prevent oxygen-induced retinopathy in rodents. Here we demonstrate that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG)-induced retinovascular protection is dependent on hepatic HIF-1 because mice deficient in liver-specific HIF-1? experience hyperoxia-induced damage even with DMOG treatment, whereas DMOG-treated wild-type mice have 50% less avascular retina (P < 0.0001). Hepatic HIF stabilization protects retinal function because DMOG normalizes the b-wave on electroretinography in wild-type mice. The localization of DMOG action to the liver is further supported by evidence that i) mRNA and protein erythropoietin levels within liver and serum increased in DMOG-treated wild-type animals but are reduced by 60% in liver-specific HIF-1? knockout mice treated with DMOG, ii) triple-positive (Sca1/cKit/VEGFR2), bone-marrow-derived endothelial precursor cells increased twofold in DMOG-treated wild-type mice (P < 0.001) but are unchanged in hepatic HIF-1? knockout mice in response to DMOG, and iii) hepatic luminescence in the luciferase oxygen-dependent degradation domain mouse was induced by subcutaneous and intraperitoneal DMOG. These findings uncover a novel endocrine mechanism for retinovascular protection. Activating HIF in visceral organs such as the liver may be a simple strategy to protect capillary beds in the retina and in other peripheral tissues.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731446","annotations":[{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.889487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.730267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.709617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.612944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.482072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.480046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Luminescence","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescence"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.288282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.211916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.112081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Precursor cell","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_cell"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"}]}
