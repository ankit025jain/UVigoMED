{"id":25783,"title":"[Italian intersocietary consensus document on aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular prevention].","abstract":"The indications for the use of aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention continue to be a source of intense debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting advices. This document, written by delegates of the main Italian scientific societies dealing with cardiovascular prevention and modeled on a similar document by the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Thrombosis, reviews the evidence in favor and against the use of aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on data cumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, this document argues for a pragmatic approach to the use of low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention, and suggests its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ?2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.
