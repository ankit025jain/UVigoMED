{"id":67095,"title":"Clinical significance of survivin expression in patients with urothelial carcinoma.","abstract":"Survivin is a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein family that plays an important role in carcinogenesis. Here, we examined the association between survivin expression and clinical outcome in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB).A total of 56 histopathologically confirmed UCB patients were recruited from the Department of Urology of Chiayi Christian Hospital from August 2007 to May 2009. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the survivin expression in tumor tissues. The -31 C/G polymorphism in survivin promoter region was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism.The frequency of high survivin expression was significantly higher in muscle-invasive tumors (66.6%) than in non-muscle-invasive tumors (34.2%) (P = 0.042) and in poorly differentiated (85.7%) tumors than in moderately differentiated tumors (30.8%) (P = 0.0014). The higher frequency of risk genotypes (C/C and C/G) was found in the median (72.7%) and high (68.0%) survivin expression groups. The multivariate analysis showed that a high survivin expression level was a potential predictive biomarker of poor overall survival (P = 0.02).Our results suggest that the high survivin expression was associated with tumor stage and grade and may present a predictive marker of overall survival in UCB.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648609","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.854922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.736231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.644641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.56298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.142371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Protein family","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Christian","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Inhibitor of apoptosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitor_of_apoptosis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Predictive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_medicine"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
