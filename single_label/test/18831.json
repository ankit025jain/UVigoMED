{"id":18831,"title":"Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles from the extract of the inflorescence of Cocos nucifera (Family: Arecaceae) for enhanced antibacterial activity.","abstract":"Green synthesis of nanoparticles using plant source has been given much importance. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using the ethyl acetate and methanol (EA: M 40:60) extracts of the inflorescence of the tree Cocous nucifera. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscope, FTIR and TEM analysis. The particle size of the synthesized AgNPs was 22nm as confirmed by TEM. The qualitative assessment of reducing potential of the extracts of inflorescence indicated the presence of reducing agents. Synthesized AgNPs exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against human bacterial pathogens viz., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella paratyphi.
