{"id":89454,"title":"Complications of distal radial and scaphoid fracture treatment.","abstract":"Fractures of the distal radius and the scaphoid are common injuries in adults. In recent years, surgical fixation of these types of fractures has increased in response to improved patient outcomes and evolving fixation techniques. Potential soft-tissue, neurovascular, or osseous complications, including tendon injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, loss of fracture reduction, and osteonecrosis, can increase the time the patient requires immobilization and can lead to poor patient outcomes. Prompt recognition and diagnosis of these complications may improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.
