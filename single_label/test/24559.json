{"id":24559,"title":"Balloon in the septum: imaging presentation of septal pseudoaneurysm and therapeutic considerations.","abstract":"Coronary pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of coronary intervention. We present a case with progression of coronary pseuodoaneurysm after a retrograde coronary intervention. According to the previous literature, conservative treatment with imaging follow-up is often adequate as an initial management of septal collateral perforation or pseudoaneurysm. However, in our case, the follow-up echocardiography and coronary angiography demonstrated rapid progression of the coronary pseudoaneurysm as a balloon-like cavity within the septum. Close imaging follow-up would be beneficial in case of complex coronary intervention to allow early treatment in case of pseudoaneurysm progression.
