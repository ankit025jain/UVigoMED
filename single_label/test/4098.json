{"id":4098,"title":"A method for predicting the outcomes of combined pharmacologic and deep brain stimulation therapy for Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the management of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the coupled adjustment of pharmacologic therapy and stimulation parameter settings is a time-consuming process and treatment outcomes are not always optimal. In this study, we develop a linear function that relates the DBS parameters, the levodopa dosage, and patient-specific preoperative clinical data with the actual treatment motor outcomes. To this end, we incorporate image-based patient-specific computer models of the volume of tissue activated by DBS in a multilinear regression analysis (6 PD patients; 60 follow up visits). The resulting predictor function was highly correlated with the actual motor outcomes (r = 0.76; p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the outcomes of a combined pharmacologic-DBS therapy can be predicted and may facilitate patient-specific treatment optimization for maximal benefits and minimal adverse effects.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485378","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.828565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.496324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.422166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.38509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.384709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.378699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.33407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.33366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"L-DOPA","weight":0.197756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Deep brain stimulation","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"},{"name":"Linear function","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.0362083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Multilinear map","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_map"}]}
