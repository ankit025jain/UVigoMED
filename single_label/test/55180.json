{"id":55180,"title":"Contact lens-assisted collagen cross-linking (CACXL): A new technique for cross-linking thin corneas.","abstract":"To report a novel method of contact lens-assisted corneal cross-linking (CACXL) in eyes with thin corneas.Patients diagnosed as having progressive keratectasia with a minimum corneal thickness less than 400 and greater than 350 ?m after epithelial abrasion were included. After epithelial abrasion, the iso-osmolar riboflavin 0.1% in dextran was applied every 3 minutes for 30 minutes. An ultraviolet barrier-free soft contact lens (0.09-mm thickness, 14-mm diameter) soaked in iso-osmolar riboflavin 0.1% for 30 minutes was placed on the cornea. Once the minimum corneal thickness value was confirmed to be greater than 400 ?m, the ultraviolet-A irradiance was started along with instillation of iso-osmolar riboflavin 0.1% in the pre-corneal and pre-contact lens region. Intraoperative minimum corneal thickness changes were recorded with ultrasound pachymetry and optical coherence tomography. Postoperative visual acuity, corneal topography (Orbscan; Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY), endothelial cell loss (EM-3000; Tomey, Nagoya, Japan), and stromal demarcation line (Visante; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) were measured.Fourteen eyes underwent the procedure. Mean preoperative minimum corneal thickness after epithelial abrasion was 377.2 ± 14.5 ?m (range: 350 to 398 ?m). There was a significant difference in minimum functional corneal thickness (Friedman test, P = .000) intraoperatively, before epithelial abrasion, after epithelial abrasion, and with contact lens and riboflavin film. Mean minimum functional corneal thickness after the contact lens was 485.1 ± 15.8 ?m (range: 458 to 511 ?m). Mean absolute increase in the minimum corneal thickness along with the contact lens and pre-corneal riboflavin film was 107.9 ± 9.4 ?m (range: 90 to 124 ?m). Mean depth of stromal demarcation line was 252.9 ± 40.8 ?m (range: 208 to 360 ?m). There was no significant endothelial loss (P = .063) and the corneal topography was stable at the last follow-up (P = .505).CACXL technique was effective and safe in performing cross-linking in corneas less than 400 ?m after epithelial abrasion and appeared effective based on stromal demarcation line depth.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972403","annotations":[{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.851453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.843373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.812875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.755108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.643209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.629605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.60503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.413376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.296871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.159287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Corneal topography","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_topography"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Nagoya","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya"},{"name":"Rochester, New York","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York"},{"name":"Carl Zeiss AG","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Jena","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena"},{"name":"Corneal pachymetry","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_pachymetry"}]}
