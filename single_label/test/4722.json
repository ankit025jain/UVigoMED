{"id":4722,"title":"[Physical, biochemical and bacterioscopic parameters of mouth lavage in patients with periodontium diseases and working on ethanol production enterprises].","abstract":"The parameters of oral bacterioscopy and homeostasis were studied in patients with periodontal diseases. The shift of pH towards the acid values, increased content of total protein were determined. Analysis of oral fluid showed increase in level of ionized calcium, nitrate anion, and decreased content of magnesium and ammonium cations. The increased overall number of bacteria in patients with periodontal diseases was seen, especially due to gram-negative bacteria.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335425","annotations":[{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Anion","weight":0.774277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nitrate","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.632743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.383227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Ammonium","weight":0.252868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.0501171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}]}
