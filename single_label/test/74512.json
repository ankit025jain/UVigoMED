{"id":74512,"title":"[Role of the psychiatric liaison nurse in suicide risk prevention].","abstract":"From suicide risk prevention to treatment, the suicidal crisis process must be known to all carers to ensure appropriate and effective care. The psychiatry liaison team at the Nantes University Hospital advocates it with somatic teams through its liaison and consultation work. At the heart of this care network, the clinical expertise of the psychiatric liaison nurse educates nursing colleagues in identifying suicide risk. The nurse's clinical assessment and knowledge of the care system optimises the overall management and the path of patient care.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335223","annotations":[{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.492179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.43624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.404832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.342541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Advocate","weight":0.0875503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Affair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"}]}
