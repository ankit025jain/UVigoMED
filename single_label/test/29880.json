{"id":29880,"title":"Gabapentin: can it be misused?","abstract":"Gabapentin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid analog drug, appears to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Gabapentin is not a controlled drug, but there are anecdotal reports of its misuse and abuse as well as reports of withdrawal symptoms associated with abrupt discontinuation. The risk of gabapentin misuse is inconsistent, the magnitude of the risk is small, and the risk is not comparable to the much higher risks associated with alcohol use; benzodiazepine, opioid, and stimulant drug use; or illicit drug use. Reports of gabapentin misuse are not unique to this drug, as misuse of prescription medications not typically considered \"drugs of abuse\" can also occur.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596960","annotations":[{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Gabapentin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Drug prohibition law","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_prohibition_law"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.547634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.513808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.451285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.410182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.255327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Anecdotal evidence","weight":0.194143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"}]}
