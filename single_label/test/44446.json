{"id":44446,"title":"Hepatic mitochondrial and ER stress induced by defective PPAR? signaling in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis.","abstract":"Emerging evidence demonstrates a close interplay between disturbances in mitochondrial function and ER homeostasis in the development of the metabolic syndrome. The present investigation sought to advance our understanding of the communication between mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress in the onset of hepatic steatosis in male rodents with defective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?) signaling. Genetic depletion of PPAR? or perturbation of PPAR? signaling by high-fructose diet compromised the functional activity of metabolic enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid ?-oxidation and induced hepatic mitochondrial stress in rats and mice. Inhibition of PPAR? activity further enhanced the expression of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA and protein, which was associated with reduced mRNA expression of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), the induction of hepatic ER stress, and hepatic steatosis. Restoration of PPAR? activity recovered the metabolic function of the mitochondria and ER, alleviated systemic hypertriglyceridemia, and improved hepatic steatosis. These findings unveil novel roles for PPAR? in mediating stress signals between hepatic subcellular stress-responding machinery and in the onset of hepatic steatosis under conditions of metabolic stress.
