{"id":50876,"title":"Refractory hypercalcaemia secondary to parathyroid carcinoma: response to high-dose denosumab.","abstract":"Hypercalcaemia is an important cause of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment but, equally, managing hypercalcaemia is of paramount importance. At present, few therapies have been shown to be effective in the most severe cases. This report describes the efficacy of denosumab in a patient with parathyroid carcinoma when conventional therapies had been shown to be relatively ineffective.SUBJECT, METHODS AND RESULTS: A 50-year-old man presented with symptomatic hypercalcaemia 1 year after the surgery for his parathyroid carcinoma. Investigations revealed raised serum calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations consistent with the recurrence of the disease. Imaging failed to localise any surgically remediable foci. Medical management with loop diuretics, calcimimetics and bisphosphonates failed to provide a sustained response. Denosumab, as a monthly injection, led to a gradual decrement in his peak calcium concentrations with the values now persistently below 3?mmol/l.Denosumab, a fully human MAB that binds to the 'receptor activator of nuclear factor ?B ligand (RANKL)', was shown to have a profound effect in modulating malignant hypercalcaemia. This medication should be considered as an effective option in patients with refractory hypercalcaemia secondary to parathyroid carcinoma.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743399","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Hypercalcaemia","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalcaemia"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.697123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.692276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.636602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.615797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.607103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.455557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"RANKL","weight":0.358226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANKL"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.287697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.18786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Denosumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denosumab"},{"name":"Parathyroid carcinoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_carcinoma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Loop diuretic","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_diuretic"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
