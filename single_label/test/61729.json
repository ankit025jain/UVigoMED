{"id":61729,"title":"Use of the ADAMTS13 activity assay improved the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis and treatment of suspected acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.","abstract":"Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (A-TTP) is a rare but significant disease requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis is often difficult because of variability in the presence of specific clinical criteria. The primary etiology of A-TTP involves inhibitors directed against ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13). Literature has shown that the ADAMTS13 activity assay is sensitive and specific for identifying cases of A-TTP, and application of this test as an on-site screening method has not been fully explored.Our objective is to determine if the ADAMTS13 activity assay can be used as a successful, on-site diagnostic modality to rapidly identify cases of A-TTP and prevent unnecessary use of prophylactic therapeutic plasma exchange.A retrospective analysis was performed including 152 patients with clinically suspected A-TTP, screened using the ADAMTS13 activity assay. Results were correlated with potential therapeutic plasma exchange treatment for all cases highly suspicious for A-TTP and evaluated for unnecessary patient morbidity and financial cost.The ADAMTS13 activity assay had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 91% and the negative predictive value was 100%. In 95% of the studies ordered, A-TTP was ruled out, leading to decreased patient morbidity and $1.7 million of potential treatment costs avoided.Implementation of the fluorescence energy transfer-based ADAMTS13 activity assay as a point-of-care laboratory study decreased patient morbidity while also directing more efficient employment of therapeutic plasma exchange in cases of suspected A-TTP.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678685","annotations":[{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.917494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.777552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.757118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.737012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.649649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.524832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.483969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombotic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.471877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.354654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.0750336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Acquired disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_disorder"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
