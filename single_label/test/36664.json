{"id":36664,"title":"Characteristics and prescription patterns of traditional Chinese medicine in atopic dermatitis patients: ten-year experiences at a medical center in Taiwan.","abstract":"Complementary and alternative therapies in treating atopic dermatitis are not uncommon. However, substantial evidence and consensus on treating atopic dermatitis is lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics and utilization of traditional Chinese medicine in patients with atopic dermatitis.We retrospectively collected patients with atopic dermatitis at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan between 2002 and 2011. Patients' demographic data, duration and frequency of treatment, serum total immunoglobulin E levels, and traditional Chinese medicine treatment principles and prescription were analyzed.There were 4145 patients (8.8%) received traditional Chinese medicine therapy between 2002 and 2011. Among them, 2841 (68.54%) chose TCM only and 1304 (31.46%) chose to combine TCM and WM therapies. Those who chose combination therapy were younger, and needed more times of visit and longer duration of treatment. The most frequent comorbid conditions accompany atopic dermatitis were allergic rhinitis (46.06%) and asthma (21.46%). Among the 87,573 prescriptions written for Chinese medicine, the most frequently prescribed herbal formula and single herb were Xiao-Feng-San (Eliminate Wind Powder) (16.98%) and Bai-Xian-Pi (Cortex Dictamni) (12.68%), respectively. The most commonly used therapeutic principles of herbal formulas and single herbs were releasing exterior (20.23%) and clearing heat (41.93%), respectively.Our hospital-based study characterized the utilization patterns of traditional Chinese medicine in atopic dermatitis patients. This information could be used as references for clinical application and provide valuable information for future clinical trials.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559829","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.719301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.671581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.534561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.518776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.397149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.257943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.252428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.22131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.217222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Chinese herbology","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_herbology"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.124839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.10739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Deforestation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Wind","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
