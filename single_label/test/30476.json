{"id":30476,"title":"Smoking crushed hyoscine/scopolamine tablets as drug abuse.","abstract":"Hyoscine N-butyl bromide/scopolamine (H/S) is a type of anticholinergic agent that is commonly used as an antispasmodic drug. We have evaluated the effects of crushed H/S smoking in prisoners who illicitly abused this drug.All imprisoned cases with at least a 3-month history of HS were evaluated from April 2012 to September 2012. Demographic information, history, and clinical findings were studied.In total, 36 male cases with a mean (SD, min-max) age of 33.3 (3.6, 27-42) years were included. All subjects were cigarette smokers with a history of substance abuse and were under Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT). The majority (75%) of participants smoked H/S tablet with pin, and others used aluminum foil. Hallucinations were the most common neurological features. Amnesia (88%), insomnia (83%), palpitation (86%), flushing (86%), irritability (94%), and inability to concentrate (91%) were the most common findings. Among them, auditory (61%), visual (72%), and tactile (72%) hallucinations were reported.This is the first case study of hyoscine smoking abuse. We found that H/S acts similar to other hallucinogens. Concurrent abuse of H/S in cases under MMT could be a future trend of abuse. Clinicians should be aware of abuse potential of H/S in treatment of some patients for drug overdose.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494624","annotations":[{"name":"Anticholinergic","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic"},{"name":"Scopolamine","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopolamine"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Methadone","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Amnesia","weight":0.753341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Antispasmodic","weight":0.735324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antispasmodic"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Hallucination","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hallucinogen","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Irritability","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritability"},{"name":"Flushing (physiology)","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_(physiology)"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.46082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.32514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.283349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.263716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.202191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.19956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Methadone maintenance","weight":0.113965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone_maintenance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}]}
