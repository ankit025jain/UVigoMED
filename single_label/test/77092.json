{"id":77092,"title":"Melatonin rescues 3T3-L1 adipocytes from FFA-induced insulin resistance by inhibiting phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser307.","abstract":"Melatonin is biosynthesized in the pineal gland and secreted into the bloodstream. Evidences indicate a role of melatonin in the regulation of glucose metabolism. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant adipocytes. Following a preincubation with melatonin or vehicle for 30 min, insulin resistant cells of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were induced by palmitic acids (300 ?M, 6 h). Our results showed that palmitic acids inhibited both the basal and insulin-stimulated uptake of [(3)H]-2-Deoxyglucose, down-regulated the levels of IRS-1 and GLUT-4. However, compared to the vehicle group, melatonin pre-treatment increased significantly the uptake of [(3)H]-2-Deoxyglucose as well as the level of GLUT-4, and decreased phosphorylated IRS-1 (Ser307) although total IRS-1 did not change significantly. These data suggest that palmitic acids impair insulin signal via down-regulating the expressions of IRS-1 and GLUT-4; whereas melatonin can ameliorate insulin sensitivity by inhibiting Ser307 phosphorylation in IRS-1 and increasing GLUT-4 expressions in insulin resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We conclude that melatonin regulates the insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis via inhibiting Ser-phosphorylation and improving function of IRS-1.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846082","annotations":[{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Pineal gland","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"GLUT4","weight":0.827617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLUT4"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.794933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.708628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Palmitic acid","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.445291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"IRS1","weight":0.439981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRS1"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.345669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0172523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
