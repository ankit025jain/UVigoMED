{"id":63184,"title":"The changing landscape of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the era of novel therapies.","abstract":"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are the most common sub-entity of mature T-cell lymphomas, and apart from particular presentations, share a poor prognosis with frequent short-term, agressive, and chemorefractory relapses. Because of the rarity and also the heterogeneity of the disease, we lack randomized clinical trials. However, to date, neither intensification of frontline chemotherapy or autologous transplant has led to any improvement of survival, and the standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, and prednisone) regimen remains the most employed as induction therapy. In the past few years, new chemotherapeutic agents, with the capability to encompass the resistance to conventional chemotherapy, such as pralatrexate or bendamustine, have been evaluated. Furthermore, identification of cell surface molecular markers (CD52, CD30, CCR4) has led to the development of new monoclonal antibodies. Similarly, the better comprehension of physiopathological mechanisms and detection of deregulated intracellular pathways encouraged the use of novel therapies such as histone deacetylase inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs. Some of these compounds have been approved for relapse, and are currently evaluated upfront in ongoing clinical trials. Despite these efforts, the global prognosis still remains much inferior to those of B-cell lymphomas, highlighting the necessity of multicenter clinical trials.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
