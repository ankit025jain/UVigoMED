{"id":41794,"title":"[Acute hepatitis C infection with prolonged intrahepatic cholestasis and remarkable progression of fibrosis mimicking fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis].","abstract":"We report the case of a 71-year-old woman with acute hepatitis C infection and persistent viremia since 2 years. Her clinical course was characterized by general fatigue and prolonged jaundice with unusually high serum bilirubin levels. Liver histology showed lymphocyte infiltration, marked fibrosis, and severe cholestasis in the periportal zone, findings mimicking fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH). Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis is a life-threatening form of recurrent hepatitis C infection that typically occurs in immunosuppressed patients. Here we report the rare case of an immunocompetent patient who developed this condition.
