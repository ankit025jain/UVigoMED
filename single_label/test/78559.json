{"id":78559,"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging-detected inner ear hemorrhage as a potential cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging in identifying the etiology of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and to correlate the high signals in the labyrinth with clinical features to identify if inner ear hemorrhage could be implicated.In this retrospective study, inner ear magnetic resonance imaging was given to 112 patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from 2011 to 2012. The clinical features of patients with high signals in the labyrinth on magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed.Abnormal magnetic resonance images were identified in 13 (11.6%) patients. Retrocochlear pathology was found in six patients, including two cases of lacunar infarction, one case of multiple ischemias in the brainstem and bilateral centrum semiovale, two cases of acoustic neuroma, and one case of inner ear hemangioma. There were seven cases showing high signals in the labyrinth on unenhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Clinical features of these seven patients were characterized by irreversible profound hearing impairment and vestibular dysfunction. These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that their symptoms were caused by an inner ear hemorrhage.The results indicate the importance of magnetic resonance imaging in sudden sensorineural hearing loss in patients. Moreover, patients with vestibular dysfunction and sudden profound hearing loss may have an inner ear hemorrhage evident by interpreting clinical and magnetic resonance imaging results.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629585","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.832085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.806838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.804907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.79293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.687869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Vestibular schwannoma","weight":0.644814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_schwannoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.584424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.542113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neuroma","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroma"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.143552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Body of vertebra","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_vertebra"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Weighting curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting_curve"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
