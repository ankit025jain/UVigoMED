{"id":3370,"title":"[Lesions of the radio-carpal joint in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and its surgical treatment].","abstract":"Affection of radio-carpal joint is most frequently revealed in patients, suffering rheumatoid arthritis. While the disease progressing in almost 75% of patients the inflammatory changes in radio-carpal joint occur. An acute and chronic synovitis, damage of a cartilage constitute a cause of a typical erosion of bones inside a joint, weakening of a tendo-ligamentous apparatus and its further deformity. Operative treatment was aimed for the inflammatory focus elimination, reduction of the pain syndrome severity, the function loss, and the joint deformity correction. The mostly used operative interventions are tenoectomy, synovectomy, arthrodesis, total endoprosthesis.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417294","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.814336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.813961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.351758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.338947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.304438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Synovitis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis"},{"name":"Synovectomy","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovectomy"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
