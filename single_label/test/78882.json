{"id":78882,"title":"A trial of treatment for acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes.","abstract":"Recent guidance for the management of acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes is based on limited evidence from trials comparing oral antibiotic agents with topical antibiotics.In this open-label, pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned 230 children, 1 to 10 years of age, who had acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea to receive hydrocortisone-bacitracin-colistin eardrops (76 children) or oral amoxicillin-clavulanate suspension (77) or to undergo initial observation (77). The primary outcome was the presence of otorrhea, as assessed otoscopically, 2 weeks after study-group assignment. Secondary outcomes were the duration of the initial otorrhea episode, the total number of days of otorrhea and the number of otorrhea recurrences during 6 months of follow-up, quality of life, complications, and treatment-related adverse events.Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation for all outcomes. At 2 weeks, 5% of children treated with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops had otorrhea, as compared with 44% of those treated with oral antibiotics (risk difference, -39 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -51 to -26) and 55% of those treated with initial observation (risk difference, -49 percentage points; 95% CI, -62 to -37). The median duration of the initial episode of otorrhea was 4 days for children treated with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops versus 5 days for those treated with oral antibiotics (P<0.001) and 12 days for those who were assigned to initial observation (P<0.001). Treatment-related adverse events were mild, and no complications of otitis media, including local cellulitis, perichondritis, mastoiditis, and intracranial complications, were reported at 2 weeks.Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were more effective than oral antibiotics and initial observation in children with tympanostomy tubes who had uncomplicated acute otorrhea.
