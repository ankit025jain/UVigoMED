{"id":78641,"title":"Prevalence and risk factors of tinnitus: the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2011, a cross-sectional study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the association between tinnitus and several potential risk factors in Korean population.A cross-sectional study.Based on data from the fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.The study included 10,061 Korean individuals.Tinnitus was assessed by using a questionnaire, and otorhinolaryngologic examination was conducted. Risk factors associated with tinnitus were evaluated using a multiple logistic regression analysis.Of the 10,061 participants ranging from 20 to 97 years old, the overall prevalence of any tinnitus was 21.4% and annoying tinnitus was 7.3%. In a multivariable logistic regression model, the following factors were associated with having tinnitus: occupational noise exposure [any tinnitus, odd ratio (OR) = 1.34; annoying tinnitus, OR = 1.47], non-occupational noise exposure (any tinnitus, OR = 1.48; annoying tinnitus, OR = 2.02), hearing impairment (any tinnitus, OR = 2.27; annoying tinnitus, OR = 3.61), chronic otitis media (any tinnitus, OR = 1.53; annoying tinnitus, OR = 1.36), chronic rhinosinusitis (any tinnitus, OR = 1.38; annoying tinnitus, OR = 1.38), temporomandibular disorder (any tinnitus, OR = 1.69; annoying tinnitus, OR = 1.90), depression (any tinnitus, OR = 1.44; annoying tinnitus, OR = 1.70), and higher stress level (any tinnitus, OR = 1.28; annoying tinnitus, OR = 1.76).These results suggest that tinnitus is common in Korea and may be associated with some avoidable risk factors.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612912","annotations":[{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.799238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.62712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.358436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.238398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.199254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.118205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0574572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Industrial noise","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_noise"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Parity (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Korean American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_American"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
