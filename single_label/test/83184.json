{"id":83184,"title":"Immigrant-native differences in caries-related knowledge, attitude, and oral health behaviors: a cross-sectional study in Taiwan.","abstract":"With the growing number of transnational marriages in Taiwan, oral health disparities have become a public health issue. This study assessed immigrant-native differences in oral health behaviors of urban mothers and their children.We used the baseline data of an oral health promotion program to examine the immigrant-native differences in caries-related knowledge, attitude, and oral health behaviors. A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from mothers in urban area, Taiwan. A total of 150 immigrant and 440 native mothers completed the self-report questionnaires. Logistic regression models analyzed the racial differences in oral health behaviors.Approximately 37% of immigrant mothers used dental floss, 25% used fluoride toothpaste, and only 13.5% of them regularly visited a dentist. Less that 40% of immigrant mothers brush their children's teeth before aged one year, 45% replaced child's toothbrush within 3 months, and only half of the mothers regularly took their child to the dentist. Immigrant mothers had lower level of caries-related knowledge and attitudes than native mothers (p <?.001). Compared to native group, the immigrant mothers were less likely to use of dental floss ([Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) =0.35], fluoride toothpaste (aOR?= 0.29), visit a dentist in the past 2 years (aOR?= 0.26), and take their children to regular dental check-up (aOR?= 0.38); whereas, they were more likely to not consume sweeten beverages (aOR?= 3.13).The level of caries-related knowledge, attitudes and oral health behaviors were found lower in immigrant mothers than native ones. The findings suggested cross-cultural caries prevention programs aimed at reducing immigrant-native disparities in child oral health care must be developed for these immigrant minorities.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423385","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.535138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.501571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.462651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.416983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.352127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.303108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"International","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.147825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.143806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.0812242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Dental floss","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_floss"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Human genetic variation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_variation"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"}]}
