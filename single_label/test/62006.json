{"id":62006,"title":"Rituximab plus chlorambucil as first-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Final analysis of an open-label phase II study.","abstract":"Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are elderly and/or have comorbidities that may make them ineligible for fludarabine-based treatment. For this population, chlorambucil monotherapy is an appropriate therapeutic option; however, response rates with chlorambucil are low, and more effective treatments are needed. This trial was designed to assess how the addition of rituximab to chlorambucil (R-chlorambucil) would affect safety and efficacy in patients with CLL.Patients with first-line CLL were treated with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) on day 1, cycle one, and 500 mg/m(2) thereafter) plus chlorambucil (10 mg/m(2)/d all cycles; day 1 through 7) for six 28-day cycles. For patients not achieving complete response (CR), six additional cycles of chlorambucil alone could be administered. The primary end point of the study was safety.A total of 100 patients were treated with R-chlorambucil, with a median follow-up of 30 months. Median age of patients was 70 years (range, 43 to 86 years), with patients having a median of seven comorbidities. Hematologic toxicities accounted for most grade 3/4 adverse events reported, with neutropenia and lymphopenia both occurring in 41% of patients and leukopenia in 23%. Overall response rates were 84%, with CR achieved in 10% of patients. Median progression-free survival was 23.5 months; median overall survival was not reached.These results compare favorably with previously published results for chlorambucil monotherapy, suggesting that the addition of rituximab to chlorambucil may improve efficacy with no unexpected adverse events. R-chlorambucil may improve outcome for patients who are ineligible for fludarabine-based treatments.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638012","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorambucil","weight":0.93444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorambucil"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.739777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.726414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.565063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.552802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.347239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.296722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.212523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Lymphocytopenia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytopenia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"375","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/375"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Advocate_v_Sheridan_and_Sheridan"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
