{"id":31141,"title":"Cue reactivity is associated with duration and severity of alcohol dependence: an FMRI study.","abstract":"With the progression of substance dependence, drug cue-related brain activation is thought to shift from motivational towards habit pathways. However, a direct association between cue-induced brain activation and dependence duration has not yet been shown. We therefore examined the relationship between alcohol cue-reactivity in the brain, cue-induced subjective craving and alcohol dependence duration and severity. Since alcohol dependence is highly comorbid with depression/anxiety, which may modulate brain responses to alcohol cues, we also examined the relation between comorbid depression/anxiety and cue-reactivity.We compared 30 alcohol dependent patients with 15 healthy controls and 15 depression/anxiety patients during a visual alcohol cue-reactivity task using functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenated level-dependent responses and subjective craving as outcomes. Within the alcohol dependent group we correlated cue-reactivity with alcohol dependence severity and duration, with cue-induced craving and with depression/anxiety levels.Alcohol dependent patients showed greater cue-reactivity in motivational brain pathways and stronger subjective craving than depression/anxiety patients and healthy controls. Depression/anxiety was not associated with cue-reactivity, but depression severity in alcohol dependent patients was positively associated with craving. Within alcohol dependence, longer duration of alcohol dependence was associated with stronger cue-related activation of the posterior putamen, a structure involved in habits, whereas higher alcohol dependence severity was associated with lower cue-reactivity in the anterior putamen, an area implicated in goal-directed behavior preceding habit formation.Cue-reactivity in alcohol dependence is not modulated by comorbid depression or anxiety. More importantly, the current data confirm the hypothesis of a ventral to dorsal striatal shift of learning processes with longer dependence duration, which could underlie increasingly habitual substance use with progressing substance dependence.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400099","annotations":[{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Putamen","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putamen"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.852481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.505245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.497909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.432301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.421529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.367016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.312456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.252612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0703685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Craving (withdrawal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craving_(withdrawal)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0168556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"}]}
