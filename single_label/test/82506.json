{"id":82506,"title":"Tooth loss prevalence and risk indicators among 12-year-old schoolchildren from South Brazil.","abstract":"This population-based cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk indicators for tooth loss due to dental caries among 12-year-old schoolchildren from South Brazil. 1,528 out of 1,837 (participation rate = 83.17%) schoolchildren were included. Tooth loss prevalence was 5.81% (95% CI = 3.71-8.98) and 0.08 (95% CI = 0.04-0.12) teeth were missing. Schoolchildren with low socioeconomic status (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.23-4.21), who repeated years in school (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.01-2.42), and with gingivitis (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.33-2.45) were more likely to have missing teeth. Schoolchildren brushing 2 times/day (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.96) or more (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.33-0.74), and those with dental insurance or private dentists (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39-0.93) were less likely to present missing teeth.
