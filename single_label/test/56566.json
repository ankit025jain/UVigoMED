{"id":56566,"title":"Intrascleral transplantation of a collagen sheet with cultured brain-derived neurotrophic factor expressing cells partially rescues the retina from damage due to acute high intraocular pressure.","abstract":"We constructed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expressing rat retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells by stable transfection of BDNF cDNA, and the RPE cells were cultured on a cross-linked collagen sheet (Coll-RPE-BDNF). BDNF expression of the Coll-RPE-BDNF was confirmed by western blot, and the Coll-RPE-BDNF was transplanted into the rabbit sclera. In vivo BDNF expression was confirmed by His expression that was linked to the expressing BDNF. The effect of the released BDNF was examined in a rabbit acute high intraocular pressure system by electroretinogram and histological examination. Statistically significant preservation of ERG b wave amplitude was observed in the rabbits treated by Coll-RPE-BDNF when compared to that of no treatment. Statistically significant preservation of the thickness of the inner nuclear layer at the transplanted area was observed in the rabbits treated by Coll-RPE-BDNF compared to that of no treatment. Intra-scleral Coll-RPE-BDNF transplantation may partially rescue retinal cells from acute high intraocular pressure.
