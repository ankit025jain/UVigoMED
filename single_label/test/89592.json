{"id":89592,"title":"[Heterologous allogeneic blood transfusion as a risk factor associated with the adverse course of the surgical wound in primary hip surgery].","abstract":"Due to its immunomodulating effects mediated by leukocytes and interleukins, heterologous allogeneic blood transfusion has been considered as a risk factor for both morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, including hip surgery. This research analyzed whether heterologous allogeneic blood transfusion is a risk factor associated with the adverse course or complication of the surgical wound in patients undergoing primary hip surgery due to fracture at a general hospital in 2008-2009.Forty-nine patients who had a complication (cases) and 207 with no complications (controls) were identified and both groups were compared with a bivariate and multivariate analysis, and demographic and clinical data, including having undergone blood transfusion or not.Not having received a blood transfusion was identified as a variable that reduced the risk of surgical wound complications (OR = 0.05, 95% confidence interval [CI 95%] 0.0067 to 0.16; chi2 with p < 0.001). The multivariate model excluded as clinically significant variables the duration of surgery (OR = 1.01, CI 95% 0.99 to 1.02; p = 0.12) and certain chronic conditions (OR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.13 to 2.24 for diabetes mellitus, OR = 1.16, CI 95% 0.29 to 4.60 for chronic hypertension, OR = 1.21, CI 95% 0.19 to 7.51 for various heart diseases).Not having received a blood transfusion reduced 95% the risk of surgi- cal wound complications. Neither the duration of surgery nor a specific comorbid condition were associated with the former event.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701771","annotations":[{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.786108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.635986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.587328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.443706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.37002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.147071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
