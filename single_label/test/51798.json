{"id":51798,"title":"Stemming the tide: rising diabetes prevalence and ethnic subgroup variation among Asians in Los Angeles County.","abstract":"The primary objective of this analysis was to examine the burden of diabetes among Asians and Asian subgroups in Los Angeles County, which has the largest county population of Asians in the U.S.Data were analyzed from 6cycles of the Los Angeles County Health Survey, 1997-2011 (n=47,282). Asian adults (n=4672) were categorized into the following ethnic subgroups: Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, South Asian, and Other Asian. Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine trends in prevalence, prevalence among Asian subgroups, and factors associated with diabetes.In 2005, we observed a rapid increase in diabetes prevalence among Asians compared to whites despite consistently lower BMI relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Diabetes prevalence was significantly higher among Filipinos and South Asians (>10%) compared to East Asians and Vietnamese (<7%). After adjusting for all covariates, Asians who were older, non-drinkers, insured, and overweight or obese were found to have increased odds of diabetes.Diabetes prevalence is increasing more rapidly among Asians compared to whites despite overall lower BMI. The significant heterogeneity among Asian subgroups highlights the need for disaggregated data and additional research to develop culturally appropriate interventions for diabetes prevention and control.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657547","annotations":[{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.715117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Filipino people","weight":0.655125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_people"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.626738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.597453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.583714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Vietnamese language","weight":0.538093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.52152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.490352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.487437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Los Angeles County, California","weight":0.485352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.454562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"China","weight":0.42471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Japanese people","weight":0.355411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.233261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0886576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0886352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"South Asian ethnic groups","weight":0.0519649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_ethnic_groups"},{"name":"East Asians","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asians"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Tide","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Broadcast Music, Inc.","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Music,_Inc."},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Igbo people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
