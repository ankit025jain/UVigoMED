{"id":25257,"title":"Sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) negatively regulates platelet activation and thrombus formation.","abstract":"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a powerful regulator of platelet formation. Enzymes generating S1P include sphingosine kinase 1. The present study thus explored the role of sphingosine kinase 1 in platelet formation and function. Activation-dependent platelet integrin ?IIb?3 activation and secretion of platelets lacking functional sphingosine kinase 1 (sphk1(-/-)) and of wild-type platelets (sphk1(+/+)) were determined utilizing flow cytometry and chronolume luciferin assay. Cytosolic Ca(2+) activity ([Ca(2+)]i) and aggregation were measured using fura-2 fluorescence and aggregometry, respectively. In vitro platelet adhesion and thrombus formation were evaluated using a flow chamber with shear rates of 1,700 s(-1). Activation-dependent increase of [Ca(2+)]i, degranulation (release of alpha and dense granules), integrin ?IIb?3 activation, and aggregation were all significantly increased in sphk1(-/-) platelets compared with sphk1(+/+) platelets. Moreover, while platelet adhesion and thrombus formation under arterial shear rates were significantly augmented in Sphk1-deficient platelets, bleeding time and blood count were unaffected in sphk1(-/-) mice. In conclusion, sphingosine kinase 1 is a powerful negative regulator of platelet function counteracting degranulation, aggregation, and thrombus formation.","date":"2014-11-17","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231106","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.805861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.754053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Degranulation","weight":0.713405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degranulation"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.686975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.645513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.334462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Sphingosine-1-phosphate","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingosine-1-phosphate"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Bleeding time","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_time"},{"name":"Luciferin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin"},{"name":"Sphingosine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingosine"},{"name":"Sphingosine kinase 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingosine_kinase_1"},{"name":"Sphingosine kinase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingosine_kinase"},{"name":"Dense granule","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_granule"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Negative regulation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_regulation"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
