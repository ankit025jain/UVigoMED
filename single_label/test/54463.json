{"id":54463,"title":"Over-supplementation of vitamin D in two patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.","abstract":"To describe the biochemical effects of an over-supplementation of vitamin D3 in two patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).Two patients (A and B) with PHPT took erroneously 2,400,000 U (300,000 U/day for 8 days) and 4,500,000 U (300,000 U/day for 15 days) of cholecalciferol, respectively. They were followed for 4 months and ionized calcium, creatinine, PTH, 25 hydroxy-vitamin D, 1,25(OH)?D and urinary calcium/creatinine levels were measured. Finally, the patients were operated on and a parathyroid adenoma was removed in both.One week after the last dose of vitamin D, serum ionized calcium (iCa) rose from 1.35 to 1.41 mMol/L (n.r. 1.14-1.31) for patient A, and from 1.43 to 1.62 for patient B, while fasting urinary Calcium/Creatinine (uCa/Cr) augmented from 0.31 to 0.50 mg/mg, and from 0.32 to 0.55, respectively. During the follow-up, the average levels of iCa were 1.37 ± 0.03 and 1.48 ± 0.07 mMol/L, while those of uCa/Cr were 0.29 ± 0.13 and 0.32 ± 0.13, both iCa and uCa/Cr levels returning to baseline values within 4 months.The unintentional over-supplementation of vitamin D in the two PHPT patients caused a moderate and temporary increase of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria and was not associated with clinical signs of toxicity.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457409","annotations":[{"name":"Hypercalcaemia","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalcaemia"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.794172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.690137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.565434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.565244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.491925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.422117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.402288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.111378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Parathyroid adenoma","weight":0.110579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_adenoma"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0629825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Primary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Hypercalciuria","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalciuria"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Uday Hussein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uday_Hussein"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
