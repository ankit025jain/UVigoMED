{"id":76070,"title":"An alternative treatment model: the combination therapy of narrow band ultraviolet B phototherapy and tacrolimus ointment 0.1% in biphasic amyloidosis.","abstract":"Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) is caused by the extracellular deposition of amyloid material in the skin without other cutaneous or systemic organ involvement. PCLA is classified into lichen, macular,and nodular amyloidosis. Macular amyloidosis and lichen amyloidosis are named as biphasic amyloidosis when they are concurrently seen in a patient. The treatment of this disease is insufficient,even if there are several alternatives for treatment. Here we present a case of biphasic amyloidosis that responded well to topical tacrolimus ointment 0.1% plus narrow band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) treatment treatment to be able to generate a new treatment alternative model. With this case presentation, by reviewing of the treatment modalities of this rarely observed case, will contribute to the solution of the disease.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272550","annotations":[{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.561266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.560895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.523601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.439437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.271491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Amyloidosis","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Lichen","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Alternative model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_model"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
