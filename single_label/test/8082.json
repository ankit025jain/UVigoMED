{"id":8082,"title":"[The influence of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on functional parameters of myocardial mitochondria during isoproterenol-induced heart injury].","abstract":"We have studied the functional parameters of mitochondria from hearts after isopreterenol-induced injury (two subcutaneous injections of isopreterenol at the dose 60 mg/kg/day). We investigated the influence of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) administered to rats (Epadol, 0.1 mg/100 gr of weight for 4 weeks) on these parameters. Isoproterenol-induced heart injury leads to a decreased parameters of respiration of isolated mitochondria in the presence of succinate. Administration of omega-3 PUFAs significantly restored the respiration rate of mitochondria: the state 3 respiration was increased by 70.12%, the state 4 by 39.87% and the respiratory control ratio by 45.19% compared to the corresponding parameters of experimental group. Also, it was shown the ability of omega-3 PUFAs to decrease mitochondria swelling (by 60%) in nominally free calcium solution. The results of the study indicate that omega-3 PUFAs improve the altered functions of the heart mitochondria evoked by isoproterenol-induced injury.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809170","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.730528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.7135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.524734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.515785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.514156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.496718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.491766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.399629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Omega","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Respiration rate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_rate"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
