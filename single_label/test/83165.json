{"id":83165,"title":"[Toxicity modifying action of remaxol by treatment of advanced oral cancer].","abstract":"The efficiency of remaxol for prevention and treatment of chemoradiotherapy toxicity effects in patients with advanced oral cancer was evaluated. Ninety-five oral cancer patients were using remaxol both locally (mouth rinse solution) and by intravenous infusion, 87 patients were included in control group. Intravenous remaxol proved to be effective for mucositis and nephrotoxicity prevention by chemoradiotherapy.
