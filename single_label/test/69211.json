{"id":69211,"title":"[Recent advances in the research on mechanisms underlying podocyte-specific gene mutation-related steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome].","abstract":"Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome poses a significant clinical challenge. Its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that podocyte-specific gene mutations may play important roles in the development of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Among the identified genes mutated in podocytes include NPHS2, NPHS1, WT1, TRPC6, MDR1, PLCE1, LMX1B, and LAMB2. This review aims to summarize the characteristics of these mutated genes in podocytes. The putative role for these podocyte-specific mutated genes in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome is also discussed.
