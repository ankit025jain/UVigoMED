{"id":23138,"title":"[The dependence of the inflammatory reaction on the properties of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the course of specific pulmonary process].","abstract":"The systemic analysis of the inflammatory process in untreated patients with newly diagnosed infiltrative-destructive tuberculosis has been performed in the context of host mycobacterium interaction. Variability of acute phase proteins (APP) reflecting mobilization of nonspecific protective systems of the body did not depend on cytotoxicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT). In 87.5% of patients the dependence between effectiveness of antitubercular chemotherapy (for three months) and combination of MBT characteristics and initial APP levels was found. Patients with effectiveness of therapy, which was inadequate to MBT cytotoxicity, were characterized by its dependence on the APP level and MBT sensitivity to antitubercular agents. Results of multifactorial analysis of parameters reflecting intensity of the inflammatory response, pathological process in the lungs, and characteristics of MBT suggest that the overall result of the host-pathogen interactions primarily depend on adequateness of protective systems of the body","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502145","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.819147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.621045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.599517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.580649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.439783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Acute-phase protein","weight":0.33462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute-phase_protein"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"}]}
