{"id":55328,"title":"Three-year outcome of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty for bullous keratopathy after argon laser iridotomy.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the 3-year outcome of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for the treatment of bullous keratopathy secondary to argon laser iridotomy (ALI).A total of 22 consecutive patients (22 eyes) with ALI who underwent DSAEK were retrospectively analyzed. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), endothelial cell density, and complications were investigated over 3 years postoperatively. The outcome of DSAEK was also compared between the ALI group and 21 other patients with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED) or pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK) (FED/PBK group).The median BSCVA improved from logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 1.40 before DSAEK to 0.30 at 6 months, 0.30 at 12 months, 0.22 at 24 months, and 0.15 at 36 months after surgery. The median endothelial cell loss was 20.3% at 6 months, 18.4% at 12 months, 32.5% at 24 months, and 46.5% at 36 months. Comparison of the ALI group with the FED/PBK group showed no significant difference in the BSCVA or endothelial cell density. Rejection affected 9.1% of the ALI group versus 0% of the FED/PBK group (P = 0.49), the graft dislocation rate was 0% versus 9.5% (P = 0.23), and posterior synechiae were found in 31.8% versus 4.8% (P = 0.046).The 3-year outcome of DSAEK for bullous keratopathy after ALI was excellent. However, caution should be exercised in patients with a history of ALI to avoid posterior synechiae after DSAEK.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915015","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.475919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.444734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Iridectomy","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridectomy"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Argon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Synechia (eye)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechia_(eye)"},{"name":"Bullous keratopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullous_keratopathy"},{"name":"Ion laser","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_laser"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"ALI (graffiti artist)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALI_(graffiti_artist)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"FED (camera)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FED_(camera)"},{"name":"PBK (composer)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBK_(composer)"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Striptease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striptease"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
