{"id":74280,"title":"Curcumin suppresses cell proliferation through inhibition of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway in medulloblastoma.","abstract":"Recently, the survival rate of medulloblastoma patients has greatly improved; yet, patients undergoing current treatment regimes suffer from serious therapy-related side-effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effects of curcumin on medulloblastoma cells by testing its capacity to suppress proliferation and regulate the Wnt/?-catenin pathway. In the present study, cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Cell cycle was observed by flow cytometry. The changes in the Wnt/?-catenin pathway were analyzed by immunofluorescence, western blot analysis and RT-PCR. Curcumin treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation in the medulloblastoma cell line. Curcumin treatment arrested the cell-cycle at the G2/M phase. Furthermore, curcumin treatment led to activation of GSK-3?, reduced expression of ?-catenin and its downstream target cyclin D1. The attenuation of the Wnt/??catenin pathway was due to the loss of nuclear ?-catenin. In conclusion, curcumin can inhibit cell growth by suppressing the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway, and it has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for medulloblastoma.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858998","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.924931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.900826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Medulloblastoma","weight":0.734308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulloblastoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"M phase","weight":0.691905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_phase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.661076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.570054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.511427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Curcumin","weight":0.445374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.276665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"G2 phase","weight":0.2682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2_phase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.188519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.176854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"GSK-3","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSK-3"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"GlaxoSmithKline","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
