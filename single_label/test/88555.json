{"id":88555,"title":"The effects of suction and pin/lock suspension systems on transtibial amputees' gait performance.","abstract":"The suction sockets that are commonly prescribed for transtibial amputees are believed to provide a better suspension than the pin/lock systems. Nevertheless, their effect on amputees' gait performance has not yet been fully investigated. The main intention of this study was to understand the potential effects of the Seal-in (suction) and the Dermo (pin/lock) suspension systems on amputees' gait performance.Ten unilateral transtibial amputees participated in this prospective study, and two prostheses were fabricated for each of them. A three-dimensional motion analysis system was used to evaluate the temporal-spatial, kinematics and kinetics variables during normal walking. We also asked the participants to complete some part of Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) regarding their satisfaction and problems with both systems. The results revealed that there was more symmetry in temporal-spatial parameters between the prosthetic and sound limbs using the suction system. However, the difference between two systems was not significant (p<0.05). Evaluation of kinetic data and the subjects' feedback showed that the participants had more confidence using the suction socket and the sockets were more fit for walking. Nevertheless, the participants had more complaints with this system due to the difficulty in donning and doffing.It can be concluded that even though the suction socket could create better suspension, fit, and gait performance, overall satisfaction was higher with the pin/lock system due to easy donning and doffing of the prosthesis.irct.ir IRCT2014012816395N1.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827560","annotations":[{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.668283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.46698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.135743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Suspension (vehicle)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Semiconductor device fabrication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Chemical kinetics","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Motion analysis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_analysis"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rehabilitation_Council_for_Torture_Victims"},{"name":"Perkinsus marinus","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkinsus_marinus"}]}
