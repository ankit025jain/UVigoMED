{"id":67639,"title":"Factors affecting the outcome of \"endometrial scratch\" in women with recurrent implantation failure.","abstract":"To examine factors affecting the outcome of the endometrial scratch in women with recurrent implantation failure.A total of 57 eligible patients with a history of recurrent implantation failure underwent an endometrial biopsy in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in the month immediately preceding the embryo transfer cycle. The comparative group consisted of a retrospective cohort of 66 women with recurrent implantation failure but without endometrial biopsy. There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in terms of age, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), free androgen index, anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone, body mass index, the number of embryos transferred, and the number of embryo transfer cycles.The clinical pregnancy rate in the intervention group (53%) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that of the control group (15%). The only predictive factor was FSH. Women with FSH < or =10 IU/L had a pregnancy rate of 57.8%, significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that (20%) of women with FSH >10 IU/L.Women with a normal FSH are more likely to derive benefit from endometrial scratch.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597285","annotations":[{"name":"Embryo transfer","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Luteal phase","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteal_phase"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.809323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Corpus luteum","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_luteum"},{"name":"Endometrial biopsy","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_biopsy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
