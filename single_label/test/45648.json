The univariate analysis was determined to analyze possible prognostic factors. Selected key factors were introduced into the COX proportional hazard model, and multivariate analysis was carried out.The 1-year survival rate was 21.85%, the median survival time was 6.80 months, and the mean survival time was 8.98 months. The univariate analysis showed that Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome types, clinical symptoms at the initial diagnosis, ascites, tumor types, ratios of foci, portal vein tumor thrombus, intrahepatic metastasis, a-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, total bilirubin classification, albumin classification, Child-Pugh classification, and domestic staging of liver cancer were significant prognostic factors (P < 0.05). The statistic data of multivariate analysis indicated that CM syndrome types, ascites, tumor types, portal vein tumor thrombus, AFP levels, Child-Pugh classification, and domestic staging of liver cancer were independent factors influencing prognosis (P < 0.05).The prognosis of PLC treated with PSQRM is determined by multiple factors including CM syndrome types, ascites, tumor types, portal vein tumor thrombus, AFP levels, Child-Pugh classification, and domestic staging of liver cancer.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672939","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.686366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.65327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.598292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"China","weight":0.41596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.391766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.296071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.177508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.126172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Guangdong","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Statistic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
