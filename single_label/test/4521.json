{"id":4521,"title":"[The influence of hyperoxic gas mixture on the respiratory part of the lungs in rats].","abstract":"The respiratory part of the lungs was investigated in rats of 3 and 12 months of age before and after the influence of normobaric hyperoxic gas mixture (40 % and 90 % oxygen). We found the reduction in middle diameter, depth, cross-sectional area, width of the entrance to alveolus and the total width of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and sacs after 28 daily hyperoxic sessions (60 mines each). We detected increasing the amount of collagen fibers, the alveolar wall thickness and oxyproline concentration in a lung after breathing the hyperoxic gas mixture. These findings could indicate the connecting tissue growth in the respiratory part of the lungs and worsening of oxygen diffusion through the blood-air barrier. The investigated indexes changed to a greater degree in rats of 3 month of age.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464720","annotations":[{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.822029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.780056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.63229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.581647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Breathing gas","weight":0.574321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.547778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.407955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.324841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Alveolar duct","weight":0.0690448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_duct"},{"name":"Respiratory bronchiole","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_bronchiole"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Chimney","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimney"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Hyperoxia","weight":0.0113784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoxia"}]}
