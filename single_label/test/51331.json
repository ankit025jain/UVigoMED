{"id":51331,"title":"Trigonella foenum-graecum L. seed mucilage-gellan mucoadhesive beads for controlled release of metformin HCl.","abstract":"Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) seed mucilage (FSM)-gellan gum (GG) mucoadhesive beads containing metformin HCl for oral use were developed through ionotropic-gelation technique. Effects of GG to FSM ratio and cross-linker (CaCl2) concentration on the drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE, %), and cumulative drug release after 10h (R10h, %) of ionotropically-gelled FSM-GG mucoadhesive beads containing metformin HCl were optimized by 3(2) factorial design. The optimized mucoadhesive beads showed DEE of 92.53 ± 3.85% and R10h of 55.28 ± 1.58% and mean diameter of 1.62 ± 0.22 mm. The in vitro metformin HCl release from these ionotropically-gelled FSM-GG beads was prolonged over 10h and followed zero-order model with super case-II transport mechanism. The optimized mucoadhesive beads also exhibited pH-dependent swelling, good mucoadhesivity with biological mucosal membrane and significant hypoglycemic effect in alloxan-induced diabetic rats over prolonged period after oral administration.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702915","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.805134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.711457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Mucilage","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucilage"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.299804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.276389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Hydrogen chloride","weight":0.136697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Factorial","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Factorial experiment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment"},{"name":"Trigonella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonella"},{"name":"Fenugreek","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Natural gum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gum"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Dee (singer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_(singer)"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"R10 (New York City Subway car)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R10_(New_York_City_Subway_car)"},{"name":"22 mm grenade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_mm_grenade"}]}
