{"id":13830,"title":"Multiple trichoblastomas in a dog.","abstract":"Hair follicle tumours generally present as benign, solitary masses and have a good prognosis following surgical resection.This report describes a case of multiple trichoblastomas in a dog.A 2-year-old crossbred dog presented with multiple soft cutaneous periocular, perilabial, submandibular and nasal nodules, between 2 and 9 cm in diameter, located on the right side of the face. New nodules were observed on the same side of the face at a second consultation 3 weeks later.Surgical resection of all nodules was performed in two procedures. Three nodules were initially resected and submitted for histolopathology and immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis was trichoblastoma for all three. At the time of the second consultation, new and remaining nodules were biopsied and the diagnosis of trichoblastoma confirmed. The dog was treated with doxorubicin and piroxicam for 30 days prior to the second surgical procedure in an attempt to reduce new tumour growth and the size of present tumours. All nodules were resected and the defects closed using rotation flaps.No recurrence of the neoplasm was noted within 10 months after surgery.Trichoblastomas are generally benign but can present as multiple neoplasms that may require surgical resection and may respond to chemotherapy. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of multiple trichoblastomas in a dog.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461035","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.797671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.601946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.299889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.234057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Piroxicam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piroxicam"},{"name":"Crossbreed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbreed"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Mass (liturgy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Submandibular ganglion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_ganglion"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
