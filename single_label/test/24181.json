{"id":24181,"title":"Mycobacterium intracellulare infection in a capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).","abstract":"This report describes the first case of Mycobacterium intracellulare infection with typical granulomatous lesions of mycobacteriosis in a capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). The individual was a captive-bred young female, part of the control group of an experimental study on stress. Multiple granulomatous lesions were detected in a mesenteric lymph node of this young female. Mycobacterial infection was confirmed by bacteriologic culture and molecular identification methods. Clinical lesions were characterized by histopathology.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450078","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.722455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.240107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Capybara","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara"},{"name":"Hydrochoerus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochoerus"},{"name":"Mycobacterium intracellulare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_intracellulare"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
