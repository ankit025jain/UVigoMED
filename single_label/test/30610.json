{"id":30610,"title":"Prevalence and causalities of tobacco consumption (TC) among adolescents: a cross sectional study at Pune.","abstract":"Health risks associated with tobacco consumption (TC) are well known. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and causality of tobacco consumption among adolescents.A cross-sectional study was conducted with 6577 participants aged 12 to 20 years from 21 schools and colleges in Pune during year 2005/6. Data on socio demographic profile, family members' tobacco habits and respondents' tobacco consumption habits were collected by self-administered questionnaire. Convenience sampling method was used for data collection.Complete information on age, gender and participants' consumption of tobacco was available for 6119 students. This data was used for analysis. Average age of the students was 16.9 +/- 1.79 years. 51% were boys. 9% lived in the hostels. Prevalence of TC was 4.2% (256). Prevalence increased from 2.1% at < 14 years to 9.8% at 18 to 20 years of age. Respondents aged < 14 years spent about Rs. 110 per month on tobacco while those over 18 years of age spent about Rs.142 per month (P < 0.05). Significantly (p < 0.0001) more boys (85.2%) consumed tobacco compared to girls (14.8%). Hostel residents consumed tobacco more than those not living in hostel (13% Vs 8.6%). Significantly more (p < 0.0001) number of fathers and brothers of TCs consumed tobacco than non TCs. (Fathers: 53.1% Vs 29.7%), (Brothers: 5.7% Vs 1.1%).Tobacco consumption among adolescents in Pune is low. However to reduce it further, intervention should start prior to teenage before they form their opinion and start consuming tobacco.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475679","annotations":[{"name":"Causality","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.666255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.620555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.578432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.470737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"College","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.274836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.22985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0726852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Pune","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Hostel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostel"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Cross-sectional study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"},{"name":"Complete information","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Indian rupee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee"},{"name":"Convenience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience"},{"name":"Christian cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_cross"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"}]}
