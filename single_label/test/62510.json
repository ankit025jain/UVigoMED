{"id":62510,"title":"PET/CT studies of multiple myeloma using (18)?F-FDG and (18)?F-NaF: comparison of distribution patterns and tracers' pharmacokinetics.","abstract":"The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the combined use of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)?F-FDG) and fluorine-18 sodium fluoride ((18)?F-NaF) PET/CT in the skeletal assessment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and to compare the efficacy of these two PET tracers regarding detection of myeloma-indicative osseous lesions.The study includes 60 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to standard criteria. All patients underwent dynamic (dPET/CT) scanning of the pelvis as well as whole body PET/CT studies with both tracers. The interval between the two exams was one day. Sites of focal increased (18)?F-FDG uptake were considered as highly suspicious of myelomatous involvement. The lesions detected on the (18)?F-NaF PET/CT scans were then correlated with those detected on (18)?F-FDG PET/CT, which served as a reference. Moreover, the (18)?F-FDG PET/CT results were also correlated with the low-dose CT findings. The evaluation of dPET/CT studies was based on qualitative evaluation, SUV calculation, and quantitative analysis based on a 2-tissue compartment model and a non-compartmental approach.Whole body (18)?F-FDG PET/CT revealed approximately 343 focal lesions while (18)?F-NaF PET/CT revealed 135 MM-indicative lesions (39 % correlation). CT demonstrated 150 lesions that correlated with those in (18)?F-FDG PET/CT (44 % correlation). Six patients demonstrated a diffuse pattern of disease with (18)?F-FDG, while 15 of them had a mixed (diffuse and focal) pattern of skeletal (18)?F-FDG uptake. A high number of degenerative, traumatic and arthritic disease lesions were detected with (18)?F-NaF PET/CT. In three patients with multiple focal (18)?F-FDG-uptake, (18)?F-NaF PET/CT failed to demonstrate any bone lesion. The dPET/CT scanning of the pelvic area with (18)?F-FDG and (18)?F-NaF revealed 77 and 24 MM-indicative lesions, respectively. Kinetic analysis of (18)?F-FDG revealed the following mean values: SUVaver?=?5.1, k1?=?0.37 (1/min), k3?=?0.10 (1/min), VB?=?0.06, influx?=?0.04 (1/min), FD?=?1.28; the respective values for (18)?F-NaF were SUVaverage?=?10.7, k1?=?0.25 (1/min), k3?=?0.34 (1/min), VB?=?0.02, influx?=?0.10 (1/min), FD?=?1.37. Apart from the correlation between VB of (18)?F-FDG and k1 of (18)?F-NaF (r?=?0.54), no other significant correlation was observed between the two tracers' kinetic parameters. We found a significant correlation between FD and SUVaverage (r?=?0.93), FD and SUVmax (r?=?0.80), FD and influx ( r?=?0.85), as well as between influx and SUVaverage (r?=?0.74) for (18)?F-FDG. In (18)?F-NaF we observed the most significant correlations between FD and SUVaverage (r?=?0.97), FD and SUVmax (r?=?0.87), and between influx and k1 (r?=?0.72).The combined use of (18)?F-FDG PET/CT and (18)?F-NaF PET/CT provides different molecular information regarding the biological processes that take place in a MM osseous lesion. (18)?F-FDG PET/CT proved to be a more specific biomarker than (18)?F-NaF PET/CT in multiple myeloma skeletal assessment.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562650","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.749698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.736605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.707504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.671469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.668899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.646861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.625723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.620545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.580041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.565126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.525589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.356171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.232798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Chemical kinetics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
