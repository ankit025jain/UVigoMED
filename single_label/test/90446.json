{"id":90446,"title":"Risk prognosis factors of chronic subdural hematoma evacuated by the novel YL-1 hollow needle aspiration drainage system.","abstract":"The novel YL-1 hollow needle aspiration drainage system is an effective minimally invasive treatment in chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH). In order to find the risk prognosis factors of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) performed by the novel YL-1 hollow needle aspiration drainage system, a logistic analysis of postoperative results was performed.One hundred ninety-four cases of chronic subdural hematoma in a period of 7 years since 2004 were collected. According to the postoperative rehabilitation effect of nerve function, the patients were divided into good prognosis group and poor prognosis group. The patients' indexes of the two groups with age, blood coagulation function, location of the hematoma, hematoma volume, admission Markwalder's grade, clinical symptoms were tested by the chi-square test, then the statistically significant factors were selected into the establishment of the Logistic regression model and further analysis of multiple factors were made on chronic subdural hematoma prognostic implications.Retrospective analysis was performed for differentiating good prognosis group (N.=174) and poor prognosis group (N.=20). Univariate analysis after the chi-square test showed that there were significant differences in gender, age, coagulation function, hematoma position, hematoma size, initial Markwalder's neurological grade, clinical symptoms and signs. Logistic regression analysis showed that chronic subdural hematoma prognostic factors sorted by odds ratio were as follows: high Markwalder's grade, male, coagulopathy, bilateral hematoma, senior citizens.We used logistic regression analysis to identify the risk prognosis factors of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) performed by a novel YL-1 hollow needle aspiration drainage systems, and found that high preoperative Markwalder's gradie, male, coagulopathy, bilateral hematoma, senior citizens will poorly affect prognosis in CSDH.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Wounds and
