{"id":87510,"title":"The conservative management of renal trauma: a literature review and practical clinical guideline from Australia and New Zealand.","abstract":"To review the literature and make practical recommendations regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.Relevant articles and guidelines published between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed. Graded recommendations were constructed by a multi-disciplinary panel consisting of urologists, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. These recommendations underwent formal review and debate at the Western Australian USANZ 2013 state conference, and were presented at the USANZ 2014 annual scientific meeting.The literature on the conservative management of renal trauma is reviewed within the framework of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury severity scale. Graded recommendations are made regarding several key topics including: imaging, inpatient management, antibiotics, return to activity, and follow-up. Grade IV injuries and intraoperative consults are examined separately in view of the difficulties these groups cause in making appropriate treatment decisions.A practical clinical guideline is provided regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124459","annotations":[{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.741106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.436281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.409084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.398527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.389795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.379276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Western Australia","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Academic conference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
