{"id":8763,"title":"[Expression of lipoprotein related genes in subchondral bone of early experimental osteoarthritis].","abstract":"To study the expression of lipoprotein related genes in subchondral bone of early experimental os-teoarthritis, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.Animals are equally divided into two groups: experimental group and control group, both of which contain fifteen rats of similar weight. The right knee joints of experimental group underwent surgery,which involved in both medial collateral ligament(MCL) transaction and medial meniscectomy, while the control group was only carried out with a sham operation. Rats were killed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks postsurgery to obtain the right knee joints. Total RNA of the subchondral bone was extracted,and then hybridized to Agilent Whole Rat Genome Microarray. Differentially expressed genes analysis was used to study the chemokine signaling pathway.Apoa5 expression was down-regulated at 1, 2 weeks post-surgery, Apoc2 expression was up-regulated at 1 week after surgery, Apol3 expression was up-regulated at 1 and down-regulated at 4 weeks post-surgery, Lrp1 expression was down-regulated at 1, 2 weeks after surgery. Lrp5 was down-regulated at 2 weeks after surgery. Gpihbp1, Lpl, Tfpi and Vldlr were up-regulated at 1 weeks after surgery. Lrpap1 and RGD1309808 were down-regulated at 4 weeks after surgery.Dysregulation of lipoprotein related genes plays an important role in pathogenesis of early experimental osteoarthritis.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754147","annotations":[{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.6914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.637738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.581645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.543733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.408908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.31387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.225947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.212667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.132057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Agilent Technologies","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agilent_Technologies"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"List of minor characters in the Matrix series","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Matrix_series"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Medial collateral ligament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament"}]}
