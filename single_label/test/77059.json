{"id":77059,"title":"Limitations of real-world treatment with atorvastatin monotherapy for lowering LDL-C in high-risk cardiovascular patients in the US.","abstract":"Guidelines endorse statin therapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to recommended levels, in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, if needed, after lifestyle changes. Atorvastatin is a common statin with greater LDL-C lowering efficacy than most other statins; its availability in generic form will likely increase its use. This study assessed attainment of guideline-recommended LDL-C levels in high-risk CVD patients treated with atorvastatin monotherapy.Analyses of two retrospective US cohorts of patients who received a prescription for atorvastatin monotherapy between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010 (index date defined as first prescription date) in the GE Centricity Electronic Medical Record (EMR) (N=10,693) and Humana Medicare (N=16,798) databases. Eligible patients were ?18 years, diagnosed with coronary heart disease or atherosclerotic vascular disease, with ?1 LDL-C measurement between 3 months and 1 year postindex date, and continuously enrolled for 1 year prior to and following the index date.Of the eligible patients, 21.8%, 29.6%, 29.9%, and 18.7% (GE Centricity EMR) and 25.4%, 32.9%, 27.8%, and 14.0% (Humana Medicare) received 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg doses of atorvastatin, respectively. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) follow-up LDL-C levels were 2.1±0.8 mmol/L (83±30 mg/dL) and 2.3±0.8 mmol/L (88±31 mg/dL) for the GE Centricity EMR and Humana Medicare cohorts, respectively. Regardless of dose, only 28.3%-34.8% of patients had LDL-C levels <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL), and 72.0%-78.0% achieved LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) in both cohorts. As many as 41% and 13% of patients had LDL-C levels ?0.5 mmol/L (?20 mg/dL) above LDL-C 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), respectively, in both cohorts; these percentages were generally similar across atorvastatin doses.In this real-world US setting, a large number of high-risk CVD patients did not attain guideline-recommended LDL-C levels with atorvastatin monotherapy. More than 65% of the patients had LDL-C levels >1.8 mmol/L (>70 mg/dL), and of these, 30%-40% had LDL-C levels ?0.5 mmol/L (?20 mg/dL) above this, regardless of dose. This suggests that more effective lipid-lowering strategies, such as statin uptitration, switching to a higher efficacy statin, and/or combination therapy, may be required to achieve optimal LDL-C lowering in high-risk patients.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851051","annotations":[{"name":"Atorvastatin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.892154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.446933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.420833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"General Electric","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"}]}
