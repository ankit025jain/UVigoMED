{"id":91631,"title":"Requesting wrist radiographs in emergency department triage: developing a training program and diagnostic algorithm.","abstract":"Crowding is extremely problematic in Canada, as the emergency department (ED) utilization is considerably higher than in any other country. Consequently, an increase has been noted in waiting times for patients who present with injuries of lesser acuity such as wrist injuries. Wrist fractures are the most common broken bone in patients younger than 65 years. Many nurses employed within EDs are requesting wrist radiographs for patients who present with wrist complaints as a norm within their working practice. Significant potential advantages can ensue if EDs adopt a triage nurse-requested radiographic protocol; patients can benefit from a significant time-saving of 36% in ED length of stay (M. Lindley-Jones & B. J Finlayson, 2000)â€” when nurses initiated radiographs in triage. In addition, the literature suggests that increased rates of patient and staff satisfaction may be achieved, without compromising quality of radiographic request or quality of service (W. Parris,S. McCarthy, A. M. Kelly, & S. Richardson, 1997). Studies have shown that nurses are capable of requesting appropriate radiographs on the basis of a preset protocol. As there are no standardized set of rules for assessing patients, presenting with suspected wrist fractures, a training program as well as a diagnostic algorithm was developed to prepare emergency nurses to appropriately request wrist radiographs. The triage nurse-specific training program includes the following topics: wrist anatomy and physiology, commonly occurring wrist injuries, mechanisms of injury, physical assessment techniques, and types of radiographic images required. The triage nurse algorithm includes the clinical decision-making process. Providing triage nurses with up-to-date evidence-based educational material not only allowed triage nurses to independently assess and request wrist radiographs for patients with potential wrist fractures but also strengthening the link between competent nursing care and better patient outcomes. A review of the literature also found that such initiatives increase patient and staff satisfaction as well as promoting efficient use of right staff at the right time.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487265","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.682687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.661523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.630211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.442052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.374059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.201841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.151096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Water supply","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Jurisdiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Medical algorithm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm"}]}
