{"id":73483,"title":"A polysaccharide from the fruiting bodies of Agaricus blazei Murill induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells.","abstract":"Polysaccharides are the major active ingredients of fungus Agaricus blazei for treating and preventing cancer. However, there are no reports showing anti-tumor activity of A. blazei polysaccharides (ABP) on human leukemia (HL)-60 cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that ABP efficiently inhibited proliferation of cultured HL-60 cells, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis. The increase in ABP-induced apoptosis was accompanied by loss of mitochondria membrane potential (??m), cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and the elevated ratio of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, reversed the cytotoxic effects and apoptotic characteristics induced by ABP in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that ABP could obviously inhibit the solid cancer growth of leukemia HL-60 in tumor xenograft model. These data demonstrated that ABP effectively induced the apoptosis of HL-60 cells via a signaling cascade of mitochondrial caspase-3-dependent pathway.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903379","annotations":[{"name":"Agaricus subrufescens","weight":0.910859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricus_subrufescens"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cytochrome c","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.804709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sporocarp (fungi)","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporocarp_(fungi)"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.60383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.580135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.419817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.222361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"HL60","weight":0.140954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL60"},{"name":"Active ingredient","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Brewing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing"},{"name":"Million","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million"},{"name":"Inductive effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_effect"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
