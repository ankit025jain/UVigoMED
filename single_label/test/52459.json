Obesity increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 20 (10.15%) young adults in the year 2002 to 64 (27.82%) in 2009. Similarly 15 (7.61%) young adults were overweight in 2002 which increased to 24 (10.43%) in 2009 (p < 0.317). Smoking increased from 8 (4.06%) to 49 (21.3%) in 2009 (p < 0.001). Family history of diabetes mellitus also showed a significant increase (p < 0.005). Hypertension increased from 13 (6.6%) young adults in 2002 survey to 17 (7.39%) in 2009, the increase was not statistically significant (p < 0.749).The present study showed that risk factors for diabetes such as overweight, obesity, smoking, hypertension and family history of diabetes increased over time in the young adults of rural Baluchistan.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601182","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.78188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.57147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.52345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.402379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.382321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"History","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Balochistan, Pakistan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan"},{"name":"749","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/749"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"1525","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1525"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"The Summer Bummer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Summer_Bummer"}]}
