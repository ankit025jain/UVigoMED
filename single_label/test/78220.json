{"id":78220,"title":"[The influence of sublingual immunotherapy on Th2 type immunoreaction in patients with allergic rhinitis].","abstract":"To explore the influence of sublingual immunotherapy on Th2 type immunoreaction in patients with allergic rhinitis within 12 months' treatment.Forty three patients with allergic rhinitis were followed-up within 12 months after receiving sublingual immunotherapy. The changes of clinic symptoms and immunoreaction were analyzed. VAS score was applied to evaluate the efficacy of clinic treatment. TIgE and sIgE in serum were tested to evaluate the systemic immunoreaction. Eosinophil counting in nasal discharge was applied to evaluate the local nasal mucosa immunoreaction.VAS scores were decreased significantly one month after the starting point of treatment, companied by the decrease of EOS count in nasal discharge (P < 0.05). The changes of TIgE and sIgE in serum within 12 months of sublingual immunotherapy were not significant (P < 0.05). The levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in nasal lavage were decreased significantly after 12 months' treatment.The bias of Th2 type immunoreaction existed in nasal mucosa immune system in patients with allergic rhinitis could been rectified partially after receiving sublingual immunotherapy for 12 months, but the significant changes were not observed in systemic immune system.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738309","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.873709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.852132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Rhinorrhea","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.537794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.401232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.166209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0845957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Canon EOS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Rectification (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_(geometry)"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"}]}
