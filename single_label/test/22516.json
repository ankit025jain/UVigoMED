{"id":22516,"title":"Distribution of oral mucosal bacteria with mecA in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation.","abstract":"We recently reported frequent detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria on the oral mucosa during the period of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and suggested an association between oral mucositis and antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. were frequently detected, and the oral cavity may be a reservoir of the gene mediating methicillin resistance, mecA. Here, we examined the frequency of mecA carriers in patients undergoing HCT.Fifty-nine patients (male (M)?=?37, female (F)?=?22, 47.3?±?11.0 years) receiving HCT were enrolled in this study. Buccal swab samples were obtained four times from day -7 to day +20 (once/week), and mecA was detected by PCR. Fifty-two subjects without systemic disease, who completed dental treatment, especially periodontal treatment (M?=?21, F?=?31, 55.4?±?14.2 years), were also enrolled as controls and checked for mecA on the oral mucosa.Seventy-six percent (45/59) of the HCT patients carried mecA at least once in the study period (days -7 to +20), while no control subjects had mecA. The frequency of mecA carriers was 19.2 % from days -7 to -1, while it was significantly increased on days +7 to +13 and +14 to +20, with frequencies of 60.9 and 63.2 %, respectively (P?<?0.01, ANOVA).mecA was detected in oral mucosa of patients undergoing HCT. The high detection frequency of staphylococci resistant to penicillin and beta-lactams in our recent report was supported.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535241","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.78088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.741097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.619195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.60058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.57789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.575058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Mucositis","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.160334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
