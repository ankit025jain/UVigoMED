{"id":38307,"title":"Non-infantile desmoplastic cerebellar ganglioglioma in a patient with multiple congenital anomalies: a rare association.","abstract":"Numerous syndromes with craniofacial, cardiac, cutaneous and vascular anomalies have been described in the literature. Here we report on a 9-year-old girl who was diagnosed as having a clavicular arteriovenous malformation with limb enlargement, an axillary port wine stain and macrocephaly with frontal bossing. She was investigated for enlarged head size; although she did not have hydrocephalus as initially suspected, she was found to have a right cerebellar lesion. This was excised and the pathology report was diagnostic of desmoplastic ganglioglioma. The posterior fossa is a very rare location for gangliogliomas. This was a desmoplastic variant that is only encountered in infants. Thus, the location and the pathology made the tumour rare. In addition, the cranio-vasculo-cutaneous lesions made this previously unreported association noteworthy.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434936","annotations":[{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.941928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.872586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Port-wine stain","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-wine_stain"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.709913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.644599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.607163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.414333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.381416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.355971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.280046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Macrocephaly","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrocephaly"},{"name":"Ganglioglioma","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglioglioma"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.135579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Posterior cranial fossa","weight":0.130153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cranial_fossa"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Desmoplastic fibroma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmoplastic_fibroma"},{"name":"Wine","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine"}]}
