{"id":88160,"title":"Historical implant or current best standard? Minimum five year follow-up outcomes of cemented Thompson hemiarthroplasties.","abstract":"UK NICE guidelines recommend abandoning the Thompson hemiarthroplasty (TH) in favour of a 'proven prosthesis' such as the Exeter Trauma Stem. The aim of this study was to assess the hip fracture treatment with the TH. Between 2002 and 2006, 430 cemented THs were performed (minimum 5 year follow-up). Death rates at 1 year and 5 years were 26.6% and 67.4% with low complication (Dislocation 1.4%) and revision rate (1.2%). The TH remains a reliable and proven implant in appropriate patients (over the age of 80, with low activity levels, low ambulatory status and who maybe cognitively impaired), due to low complication and revision rates. Modern implants may provide better function or longevity, but there is little evidence to support abandoning the TH.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890999","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.708981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.381255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.324541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.228904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.215183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.198984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.126024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0621111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Exeter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter"},{"name":"Hemiarthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiarthroplasty"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"2006 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Longevity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
