{"id":45599,"title":"Clinico-pathological study of K-ras mutations in colorectal tumors in Saudi Arabia.","abstract":"K-ras gene mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We characterized K-ras mutations in colorectal tumors in patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in terms of geographic area, age, gender, histology, stage, and anatomical localization.Medical records and paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 150 consecutive patients with histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma referred to two centers in Saudi Arabia were analyzed using an LCD-array kit.K-ras mutations occurred in 56% of the patients; 48.7% of the mutations were in codon 12, most commonly p.G12V and p.G12D (each 35.6% of codon 12 mutations). Codon 13 mutations occurred in 7.3% of tumors: of these, most were p.G13D (90.9%) with the remainder p.G13R (9.1%). Codon 12 mutations overall were associated significantly with stage IVb tumors (P = 0.022) and rectal tumors (P = 0.028), with a trend of an association with a sigmoid location (P = 0.054). The p.G12V mutation was significantly associated with sigmoid tumors (P = 0.021) and negatively associated with left-sided tumors (P = 0.011), with a trend of an association with age ?70 years (P = 0.062) and rectal tumors (P = 0.063). Other clinicopathological features were not significantly associated with K-ras mutations.K-ras mutations are common among the Saudi colorectal cancer population, especially pG12V and pG12D in codon 12, and are more frequent in sigmoid and rectal adenocarcinomas and stage IVB tumors.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675495","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.856791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.743269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.734941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.593318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.444734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","weight":0.0643106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"D 90 road (United Arab Emirates)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_90_road_(United_Arab_Emirates)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Schedule 13d","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule_13d"},{"name":"Group of Thirteen (Canadian universities)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Thirteen_(Canadian_universities)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"New York State Route 12D","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_12D"}]}
