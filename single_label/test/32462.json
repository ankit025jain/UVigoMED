{"id":32462,"title":"Total endovascular treatment of an aortic arch aneurysm in a patient with a mechanical aortic valve.","abstract":"Endovascular repair of aortic arch aneurysms using an inner-branched device is a new treatment option for patients unfit for open surgery. There are many anatomical restrictions, such as the presence of a mechanical aortic valve that can contraindicate this complete endovascular approach.A new delivery system to overcome this issue has been developed. This new system was used to treat an aortic arch aneurysm 77 mm in diameter in a 37-year-old patient with Marfan's syndrome. The patient was considered to be at major risk for open surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency following a second sternotomy.Total endovascular arch aneurysm repair is no longer contraindicated in patients with a mechanical aortic valve.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951372","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.677395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.545403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.454221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.235355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Boom tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_tube"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"}]}
