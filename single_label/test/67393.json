{"id":67393,"title":"Loss of CDC14B expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: meta-analysis of microarray data sets.","abstract":"To discover significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) that might be unidentified by single microarray analysis.The effect sizes of five ccRCC microarray data sets were combined using a random-effects model. The most downregulated gene was validated in paired 80 ccRCC tissues by immunohistochemistry.CDC14B was the most downregulated gene among 1,761 DEGs. CDC14B was strongly expressed in the apical proximal tubules in the nonneoplastic tissues, while it was completely absent in 10 (12.5%) of 80 or downregulated in 70 (87.5%) of 80 ccRCC cases. The complete loss of CDC14B correlated with high T stage (P = .038), advanced TNM stage (P = .027), tumor recurrence (P = .038), and shorter recurrence-free survival (P = .046) compared with the partial loss of CDC14B.Microarray meta-analysis is a useful tool for pathologists. CDC14B expression is downregulated in ccRCC, suggesting its role in renal carcinogenesis.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619757","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.784132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.615836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.496324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.207942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.140676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"761","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/761"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Data set (IBM mainframe)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set_(IBM_mainframe)"},{"name":"Aircraft upset","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_upset"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
