{"id":56820,"title":"[Occurrence and characteristics of cardiovascular pathology in patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma].","abstract":"Among known glaucoma triggers, pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) is most of all studied. Development of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in some patients with PXF and certain somatic diseases requires further investigation. This study was aimed to evaluation of glaucoma risk in patients with PXF in relation to concurrent somatic pathology. A total of 185 patients aged from 48 to 87 diagnosed with OAG and, additionally, 75 patients of control group were assessed. Complex examination was performed and anamnestic data collected in all cases. A statistically significant relationship between OAG development and the presence of primary hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic cerebral circulatory insufficiency, and atherosclerosis in patients with PXF has been established.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624800","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.833987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.569012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.3217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cardiovascular pathology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_pathology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
