{"id":32259,"title":"Corrected QT-interval prolongation and variability in intensive care patients.","abstract":"Critically ill patients are at risk for prolongation of the interval between the Q wave and the T wave in the electrocardiogram (corrected QT [QTc]). Corrected QT prolongation is probably a dynamic process. It is unknown how many patients have a QTc prolongation during their intensive care stay and how variable QTc prolongation is.In a prospective cohort study, continuous 5-minute QTc measurements of 50 consecutive patients were collected. A prolonged QTc interval was more than 500 milliseconds for at least 15 minutes. The QT variance and variability index was used to evaluate QTc variation.Fifty-two percent of included patients had a prolonged QTc interval. In a single patient, 0.2% to 91.3% of the QTc intervals over time were prolonged. The use of erythromycin and amiodarone was associated with the mean QTc (P = .02 and P = .006, respectively). The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were significantly higher in patients with a prolonged QTc interval (30.8 vs 8.6 and 7 vs 5.5, respectively). Eighty-four percent of all patients received at least 1 QTc-prolonging drug. The QT variance and QTc variance were significantly higher in patients with a prolonged QTc (P = .019 and P = .001, respectively).Continuous QTc monitoring showed a prolonged QTc interval in 52% of intensive care patients. Severity of illness and QT and QTc variances are higher in these patients.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986247","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.703661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.525405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.391214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Amiodarone","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiodarone"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.305493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.169978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Erythromycin","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythromycin"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"T wave","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_wave"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0162547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Q (New York City Subway service)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(New_York_City_Subway_service)"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"}]}
