{"id":4961,"title":"Retention of fetal bones 8 years following termination of pregnancy.","abstract":"Foreign bodies; in particular, fetal bones may present with a variety of clinical symptoms and signs including infertility, vaginal discharge, disparonia, pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding. Many case reports were described post- abortal removal of retained fetal bone at varying time intervals from the previous (D&E), ranging from weeks to years. In our case, a 34-year-old woman presented with abnormal uterine bleeding and secondary infertility, her only pregnancy being a termination 8 years previously at 15 weeks' gestation. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized, normal-shaped uterus with an echogenic scarred endometrium. After then office hysterescopy revealed fragments of the immature bone. All the immature bones were removed by operative hysterescopy. Significant numbers of patients may have endometrial pathology; the differential diagnosis of such unusual findings on ultrasound examination includes intrauterine contraceptive devices, foreign bodies, calcified submucous fibroids and Asherman's syndrome, as well as rarities such as heterotopic bone. The presence of this pathology may be a causal or contributory factor to subfertilty, and will remain undetected if the endometrium is not routinely evaluated. Indeed, these cases highlight the advantage of performing a hysteroscopy at the same time as the more invasive laparoscopy and dye insufflation, in selected cases.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509981","annotations":[{"name":"Hysteroscopy","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteroscopy"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Gynecologic ultrasonography","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologic_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Intrauterine device","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_device"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.688752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Dysfunctional uterine bleeding","weight":0.641265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_uterine_bleeding"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Vaginal bleeding","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_bleeding"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.566255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.55219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vaginal discharge","weight":0.0389337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_discharge"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"}]}
