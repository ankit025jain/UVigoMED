{"id":25376,"title":"New therapeutic options in heart failure. What's on the horizon? An overview.","abstract":"Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome responsible for high morbidity and mortality in the world. Despite advances in the management of heart failure, the prognosis of these patients remains poor and there is a critical need for new treatment strategies improving the clinical outcomes. New approaches in heart failure therapies target cellular mechanisms, as well as mechanical and structural aspects of heart failure that are not addressed by recent therapies. These include abnormalities in molecular mechanisms, electrical conduction and ventricular remodeling. This review presents the pathophysiological basis, mechanisms of action and available clinical efficacy and safety data of drugs and mechanical therapies that are currently under development.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25215348","annotations":[{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.706838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.639073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.62659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.585264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.579322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.428425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.39749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.247095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.103477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0926598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Horizon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
