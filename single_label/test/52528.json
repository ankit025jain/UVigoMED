{"id":52528,"title":"Ultra-short term clomiphene citrate in high responder women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a case series.","abstract":"To evaluate a new trial of short-term clomiphene citrate (CC) in high responder women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).This case series was conducted in the infertility outpatient clinics of two centres. Ovulation induction was performed with CC 50-100mg a day in six high-responder women with PCOS who had a history of cancellation of treatment because of ?3 mature follicles between March 2010 and June 2013. Induction was initiated on the third day of their cycles and the duration of induction was only two days. Demographic data of the patients, number of mature follicles on hCG day, ovulation rate, luteal phase length, pregnancy rate, and type of pregnancy were recorded. All data were analysed by SPSS packet programme (SPSS, 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).The median number of mature follicles and duration of the follicular phase were 1.3 (1-2) and 11.9 (11-14) days, respectively. The ovulation rate was 80% (12/15) and pregnancy rate per cycle was 26.6%.If this hypothesis is supported by large prospective randomised controlled studies, ultra-short term ovulation induction with CC may provide an alternative approach for high-responder women with PCOS who have a history of treatment cycle cancellations.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594076","annotations":[{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.846453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Clomifene","weight":0.818371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.790689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Follicular phase","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_phase"},{"name":"Luteal phase","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteal_phase"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Corpus luteum","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_luteum"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.60276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.58324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.432968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.308333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Chicago","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
