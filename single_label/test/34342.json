{"id":34342,"title":"[Ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass for atypical coarctation with intractable hypertension due to aortitis syndrome; report of a case].","abstract":"A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital. Aortitis syndrome was diagnosed 12 years ago. She developed intractable hypertension and a computed tomography scan showed coarctation of descending aorta with severe calcificaiton. Her ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) was 0.74 on the right side and was 0.70 on the left side. She underwent a bypass operation with 14 mm-diameter prosthetic graft from ascending aorta to the infrarenal abdominal aorta without using cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperatively, ABI was 1.22 on the right side and was 1.21 on the left side, and hypertension was well controlled.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743537","annotations":[{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.876586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.844425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Abdominal aorta","weight":0.508429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aorta"},{"name":"Descending aorta","weight":0.415019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_aorta"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.359972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.356056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Ankle brachial pressure index","weight":0.20207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle_brachial_pressure_index"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.156944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.131777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.0465866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Aortitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortitis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Ascending colon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_colon"}]}
