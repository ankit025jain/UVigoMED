{"id":24194,"title":"Ribotype 027 Clostridium difficile infections with measurable stool toxin have increased lactoferrin and are associated with a higher mortality.","abstract":"We evaluated clinical and diagnostic indicators of severe C. difficile infection (CDI) and their association with poor clinical outcome. A total of 210 patients positive according to PCR (toxin B: tcdB) were included, with patients having a median age of 62 years and a Charlson co-morbidity index (CI) score of 5. Ninety-one percent (n?=?191) were positive by toxigenic culture and 61% (n?=?129) had stool toxin. Toxin-positive patients had significantly higher fecal lactoferrin (mean 316 ?g/g versus 106 ?g/g stool; p?<?0.0001). Forty percent of patients (n?=?85) were infected with ribotype 027 and significantly more of these patients had measurable stool toxin (79% vs. 50%; p?<?0.0001). The mean fecal lactoferrin was significantly higher for toxin-positive 027 CDI compared with the 027 toxin-negative group (317 vs 60 ?g/g; p?=?0.0014). Ribotype 027 CDI with stool toxin showed a higher all-cause, 100-day mortality compared with non-027 with stool toxin (36 % vs 18%; p?=?0.017). Logistic regression univariate analysis for odds ratio (OR) and p values revealed that age (OR?=?1.1), intensive care unit treatment (OR?=?2.7), CI (OR?=?1.2), 027 CDI (OR?=?2.1), white blood cell count (OR?=?1.0), albumin level (OR?=?0.1), and stool toxin-positive 027 CDI (OR?=?2.5) were significantly associated with 100-day mortality (p?<?0.05). In conclusion, CDI PCR-positive patients with 027 infection and stool toxin have increased lactoferrin and are at an increased risk of death.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449345","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.754497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.714885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.625913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Lactoferrin","weight":0.576382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactoferrin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.309523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.217446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.134162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0750336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
