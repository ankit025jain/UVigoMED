{"id":19054,"title":"[Reparative osteogenesis after incorporation of roncoleukin into therapy for experimental tuberculous gonitis].","abstract":"The authors evaluated reparative osteogenesis after incorporation of roncoleukin into combination therapy for experimental drug-resistant tuberculous osteitis. Roncoleukin (12.5 pg/kg, 5 injections, once every 3 days) was used during antituberculosis therapy before and after combined plasty (autobone + OsteoSet-T) in repairing surgical defects. When used in the postoperative period of combined osteoplasty, roncoleukin was shown to contribute to a reduction in the spread of specific inflammatory foci in bone tissue, cessation of an alternative necrotic component, an increase in the rate of osteogenesis with newly formed bone trabeculae, and activation of hematopoietic processes in the bone marrow. In parallel with intensified bone reparative processes, there was immunomodifier-induced stimulation of the absorption and digestion of peritoneal macrophages suppressed in experimental tuberculous osteitis.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745193","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.449388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.421785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Trabecula","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecula"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.35107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.215692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Osteitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteitis"},{"name":"Process (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(anatomy)"}]}
