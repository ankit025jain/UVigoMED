{"id":85818,"title":"Macitentan (Opsumit) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.","abstract":"The endothelin pathway is a key pathway for the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Antagonism of this pathway is recommended as initial therapy in low-risk patient with PAH to inhibit fibrosis, cell proliferation, and inflammation caused by endothelin. Prior to October 2013, ambrisentan, a selective ETA receptor antagonist and bosentan, a dual ETA/ETB antagonist, were the only currently available agents for PAH targeting the endothelin pathway. Based on the results of the SERAPHIN trial, macitentan (brand name OpsumitÂ®), a new ETA/ETB antagonist, has been US FDA approved to delay disease progression and reduce hospitalizations for PAH. SERAPHIN is the first ERA trial to use an event-driven strategy with a composite primary end point of morbidity or mortality. Previous trials have focused on short-term outcomes, such as improved 6-min walk distance and WHO functional class.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851934","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.606847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.543806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.461358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.365988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.361052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.326696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ambrisentan","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrisentan"},{"name":"Brand","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Bosentan","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosentan"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Predation","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"}]}
