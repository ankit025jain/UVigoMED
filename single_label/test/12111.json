{"id":12111,"title":"[Anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of cyclopentyladenosine on the model of convulsive status in rats].","abstract":"The neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects of cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) have been studied on a new experimental model of the convulsive status in rats aged 3-4 months and 10 days. The convulsive status was modeled by intracerebroventricular injection of ferakril (water-soluble polymer of polyacrylic acid) solution. It is established that prophylactic administration of CPA results in a relatively lower degree of neurological deficit, both in the acute phase and on the next day, compared to the untreated control. Considering that adenosine receptor agonists are analogs of the natural metabolites that have minimal side effects and expressed neuroprotective properties, the use of agents of this group is perspective for both prevention and treatment of seizure conditions in neurology and neurosurgery.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555227","annotations":[{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.886344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Convulsion","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsion"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.577528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adenosine receptor","weight":0.504073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_receptor"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Polyacrylic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylic_acid"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Certified Public Accountant","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"}]}
