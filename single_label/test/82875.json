{"id":82875,"title":"[Confirmatory study on the regression equation for children dental behavior in Beijing].","abstract":"To test and verify the regression equation got before for children's dental behavior management problems(BMP).The study group included 279 children aged 2- < 8 years who received dental treatment by 16 pediatric dentists in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School of and Hospital of Stomatology. Interviews were conducted with accompanying guardians and children's dental behavior was rated by a modified Venham's clinical anxiety scale and a cooperative behavior rating scale. The variables were put into the regression equation and the results were compared with their dental behavior scale.The accuracy rate of regression equation reached 84.2% (235/279) , sensitivity was 0.613 (95%CI:0.514-0.712) and specificity was 0.957 (95%CI:0.928-0.986).The regression equation is characterized by its accuracy rate at a good level. Younger age, negative guardian expectations of the child's behavior during treatment, anxiety or shyness around strangers, and presence of toothache were four risk factors for children's dental BMP.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495722","annotations":[{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.784596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.672826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.365147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.363254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.195637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Peking University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University"},{"name":"BMP file format","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format"},{"name":"Stomatology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatology"},{"name":"Behavior management","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Toothache","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothache"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"712","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/712"},{"name":"957","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/957"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Shyness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyness"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Legal guardian","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian"},{"name":"University School","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_School"}]}
