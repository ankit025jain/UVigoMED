{"id":19029,"title":"Pneumococcal vaccination in Europe: schedule adherence.","abstract":"Nonadherence to recommended pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) schedules may have implications for protection against pneumococcal disease. In this commentary, we have assessed adherence to the recommended dosing schedules (the completion of the primary PCV and booster series) in different European countries. We found that adherence with the PCV schedule was lower than that for diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) and that higher adherence was observed in countries where PCV vaccination is recommended and funded. Adherence with the booster dose is often lower than that with the primary series completion, and it is often given after the recommended age. These data highlight the need to encourage timely vaccination of children with PCV, in line with local immunization schedules. There is no single solution to improve adherence; actions need to be tailored to the context of individual countries through initiatives at the national, regional, and local levels and should target different stakeholders.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746990","annotations":[{"name":"Pertussis","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"DPT vaccine","weight":0.780751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.716136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.712346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.597719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.353472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.266528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.135256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"On-time performance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-time_performance"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Stakeholder (corporate)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Dosing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosing"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
