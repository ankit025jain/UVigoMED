{"id":452,"title":"[Attitudes towards physical disability in the Middle Ages].","abstract":"The article describes attitudes to disability and physically disabled people, taking into account the aspect of ethical and social location, what physically disabled meant in societies, and ways to solve the problems of disability. The article is based on studies of disability and historical sources. Christ's attitude shown in the Gospels changed the traditional cultures of the ancient treatment of disability in terms of it being seen as a penalty of the divine. The development of Christianity caused a gradual expansion of the ideas of charity, at the same time stepping up care and material support to all those physically disabled in need. Care of the disabled is based mostly on charity. Church activities supported, by the structure of the State and private individuals, was of paramount importance. Medieval society felt responsible for disabled people.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518101","annotations":[{"name":"Middle Ages","weight":0.83192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"},{"name":"History","weight":0.828404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Christianity","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Ancient history","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.566255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.403001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.382308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Charitable organization","weight":0.332612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.318004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gospel","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel"},{"name":"Catholic Church","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"},{"name":"Divinity","weight":0.272668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"History of Christianity","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0797502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Sentence (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)"},{"name":"Physical disability","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability"}]}
