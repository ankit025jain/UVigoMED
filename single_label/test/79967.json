{"id":79967,"title":"Nine human sparganosis cases in Thailand with molecular identification of causative parasite species.","abstract":"Human sparganosis is one of the neglected diseases but important food-borne parasitic zoonoses. The disease is caused by larvae (spargana) of diphyllobothriidean tapeworm. Here, we describe nine cases of human sparganosis, caused by Spirometra erinaceieuropaei in a hospital in Thailand during 2001-2012. Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of cases were revealed. Diagnosis and identification of causative parasite species was made by histopathological investigations followed by a polymerase chain reaction-based molecular method using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues. The DNA samples were extracted from tissues and a partial fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene was amplified for the detection of parasitic DNA. Infection could be prevented by increasing activities on health communication by responsible public health agencies.
