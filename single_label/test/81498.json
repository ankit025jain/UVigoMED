{"id":81498,"title":"Stress analysis of different configurations of 3 implants to support a fixed prosthesis in an edentulous jaw.","abstract":"This study's aim was to evaluate the stress distribution in a mandibular implant-supported prosthesis and peri-implant bone considering implant quantity, diameter and position using linear 3-D finite element analysis. Models of an anterior jaw comprised 4 groups according to implant quantity, diameter, and position: control group C, 5 regular implants; R, 3 regular implants; W, 3 wide implants; and DTR, 3 regular implants with the distal ones tilted 30Â° distally. The cantilever was loaded with an axial load of 50 N. Data was evaluated using von Mises stress on implants and maximum principal stress and microstrain on the bone. The W group showed the lowest value of maximum principal stress in peri-implant bone of the loaded side (4.64 MPa) when compared to C (5.27 MPa), DTR (5.94 MPa), and R (11.12 MPa). Lower stress values in the loaded implants were observed in the experimental groups when compared to the C group. However, the unloaded implants presented opposite results. All the screws of the W group presented lower stress values when compared to the C group. However, the R and DTR groups presented an increase in stress values with the exception of the loaded screw. A reduction in the number of implants associated with wider implants reduced the stress in the bone and prosthetic components.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000604","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Deformation (mechanics)","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.54666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.509846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.500094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Finite element method","weight":0.423167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.303387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.165548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.113403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Von Mises yield criterion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises_yield_criterion"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Cantilever","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantilever"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Models (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_(band)"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Von Mises","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Stress analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_analysis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Finite set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The W","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_W"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Meat on the bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_on_the_bone"}]}
