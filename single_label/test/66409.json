{"id":66409,"title":"Deletion of p18(INK4c) aggravates cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.","abstract":"Protection of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) has been demonstrated in acute kidney injury (AKI). However, previous studies on CDKIs have mainly focused on CIP/KIP family members, with INK4 family members rarely being investigated. This study investigated the behaviors of p18(INK4c) (p18) in cisplatin-induced AKI using p18 gene knockout mice (p18-/-). AKI was induced in p18-/- and wild-type (p18+/+) mice after a single cisplatin (12.5 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection. Protection by p18 was identified by a comparison of survival, renal function and morphological injuries between p18-/- and p18+/+ mice. Further investigation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) was performed by western blot analysis in p18-/- and p18+/+ kidneys at day 3 after cisplatin injection. The results revealed that after cisplatin injection, the survival of p18-/- mice was significantly shorter than that of p18+/+ mice, accompanied by aggravated renal function and more severe morphological injuries. Deletion of p18 also significantly aggravated ERS in cisplatin-induced AKI. In conclusion, p18 exerts protective effects on cisplatin?induced AKI, which may be associated with the effect of p18 on cell death pathways, such as the ERS pathway.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714825","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.887116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.870536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.735901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.715955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.677638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.647608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.401339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.360173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.332234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.297581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.27051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.138729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"}]}
