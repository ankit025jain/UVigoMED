{"id":30162,"title":"[Treatment possibilities in advanced Parkinson's disease].","abstract":"In the course of Parkinson's disease, advanced and late stages can be distinguished. In the advanced stage, levodopa has good effect on motor symptoms, but patient care is often hindered by levodopa-induced complications such as motor fluctuation and dyskinesias. In the late stage levodopa response becomes poor, falls, dementia and psychotic symptoms appear and patients often need hospitalization. In the advanced stage, the quality of life may be improved better by device-aided therapy than by best oral medical treatment. The alternatives are apomorhin pump, levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel with pump and deep brain stimulation. The therapy plan should be based on the principle: \"the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right time\".","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555235","annotations":[{"name":"L-DOPA","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Deep brain stimulation","weight":0.733426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.637578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.485035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Carbidopa","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbidopa"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.153863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"}]}
