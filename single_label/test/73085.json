{"id":73085,"title":"Opening a niche for therapy: local lymphodepletion helps the immune system to fight melanoma.","abstract":"In this issue, Fujiwara et al. report that local ablation of CD4+ T cells in a murine B16 melanoma model, together with concomitant activation of the immune system by OX40L, leads to complete rejection of the melanomas. Rejection was driven mainly by CD8+ T cells, which infiltrated the melanomas and secreted sizeable amounts of IFN-?. However, CD8+ T-cell infiltration also caused the recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Although these cells did not prevent the rejection of the melanomas, in clinical settings the long-term repopulation of tumors by MDSCs may counteract successful treatment. Thus, local ablation of CD4+ leukocytes may improve anti-melanoma therapies in humans, but at the same time MDSC levels in the tumor cells have to be kept in check to ensure treatment success.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924759","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.653208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.575724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.314095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"CD134","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD134"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
