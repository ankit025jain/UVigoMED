{"id":50828,"title":"Comparisons of cognitive function and serum S-100B level between diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of carotid artery stent (CAS).","abstract":"To investigate cognitive function improvement in diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of Carotid Artery Stent (CAS), 128 patients suffering severe carotid stenosis were successfully enrolled in this study. Tests including, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R) and the serum levels of S-100B, were all measured at baseline for 3 months after the implantation of CAS. The baseline characteristics were similar between the patients with and without diabetes. 3 months after the implantation, significant improvements in MMSE (24.8 ± 2.2 vs. 25.2 ± 2.1, p=0.003), MoCA (25.6 ± 2.0 vs. 26.1 ± 1.9, p=0.000), ADAS-Cog (6.5 ± 1.3 vs. 6.1 ± 1.3, p=0.000), and CDT (3.3 ± 0.7 vs. 3.5 ± 0.7, p=0.034) were observed in the non-diabetic group. In contrast, there was no significant improvement in any of the cognitive test for the diabetic group. Another interesting discovery was the CAS procedure significantly decreased the S-100B level in the non-diabetic group (0.11 ± 0.04 ng/mL vs. 0.10 ± 0.04 ng/mL, p=0.000), but similar phenomena were not discovered in the diabetic group. In this light, the change of the S-100B level was negatively correlated with the results in the MMSE (p<0.01) and the MoCA (p<0.01) tests, and positively correlated with the result in ADAS-Cog (p<0.05) test. Our findings suggest that the CAS-induced beneficial effects on cognitive function might have a correlation relationship with the serum level of S-100B.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746932","annotations":[{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Carotid artery stenosis","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_artery_stenosis"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.586875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.575998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.489899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.40368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.341547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Central Time Zone (North America)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Time_Zone_(North_America)"},{"name":"S100B","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S100B"},{"name":"Cognitive test","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_test"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Mini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Discovery (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Staatsexamen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatsexamen"},{"name":"Mini-mental state examination","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-mental_state_examination"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scotland B national football team","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_B_national_football_team"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"}]}
