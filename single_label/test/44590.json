{"id":44590,"title":"The combination of MK-5172, peginterferon, and ribavirin is effective in treatment-naive patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis.","abstract":"MK-5172 is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3/4A protease; MK-5172 is taken once daily and has a higher potency and barrier to resistance than licensed protease inhibitors. We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of MK-5172 with peginterferon and ribavirin (PR) in treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis.We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, dose-ranging, response-guided therapy study. A total of 332 patients received MK-5172 (100, 200, 400, or 800 mg) once daily for 12 weeks in combination with PR. Patients in the MK-5172 groups received PR for an additional 12 or 36 weeks, based on response at week 4. Patients in the control group (n = 66) received a combination of boceprevir and PR, dosed in accordance with boceprevir's US product circular.At 24 weeks after the end of therapy, sustained virologic responses were achieved in 89%, 93%, 91%, and 86% of the patients in the groups given the combination of PR and MK-5172 (100, 200, 400, or 800 mg), respectively, vs 61% of controls. In the MK-5172 group receiving 100 mg, 91% of patients had undetectable levels of HCV RNA at week 4 and qualified for the short duration of therapy. The combination of MK-5172 and PR generally was well tolerated. Transient increases in transaminase levels were noted in the MK-5172 groups given 400 and 800 mg, at higher frequencies than in the MK-5172 groups given 100 or 200 mg, or control groups.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727022","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Boceprevir","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boceprevir"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.403971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.347891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.245668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Viral nonstructural protein","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_nonstructural_protein"}]}
