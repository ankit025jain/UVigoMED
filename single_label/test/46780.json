{"id":46780,"title":"Endoscopic full-thickness resection with defect closure using clips and an endoloop for gastric subepithelial tumors arising from the muscularis propria.","abstract":"This retrospective study evaluated the safety and efficacy of endoscopic full-thickness resection (eFTR) with defect closure using clips and an endoloop for the treatment of gastric subepithelial tumors (SETs) arising from the muscularis propria (MP).From January 2009 to December 2012, 51 patients with gastric SETs arising from the MP underwent eFTR with defect closure using clips and an endoloop. The key steps were (1) several milliliters of mixture solution was injected into the submucosa after dots were marked around the tumor; (2) a cross incision was made in the mucosa to reveal the tumor; (3) subsequently, circumferential excavation was performed as deep as the muscularis propria, and full-thickness resection of the tumor was performed with an insulated-tip knife, including its underlying MP and serosa; (4) the gastric wall defect was closed with clips and an endoloop was then placed to fix and tighten all of the clips together.Successful complete resection by eFTR was achieved in 50 cases (98.0%). One case failed and was converted into a laparoscopic resection due to the tumor falling into the peritoneal cavity during the procedure. The mean procedure time was 52 min. No patients had severe complications, such as massive bleeding, delayed bleeding, peritonitis, or gastrointestinal tract leakage. The mean tumor length was 2.4 cm. Pathological diagnoses of the tumors were leiomyomas (21/51) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (30/51). The median follow-up period after the procedure was 22.4 months (range 1-48 months), and no residual tumor or tumor recurrence was detected during the follow-up period.eFTR with defect closure with clips and an endoloop appears to be a safe and effective technique for the treatment of patients with gastric SETs originating from the MP, especially for those with extraluminal growth or adhesions to the MP.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619327","annotations":[{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Peritoneal cavity","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_cavity"},{"name":"Serous membrane","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_membrane"},{"name":"Muscularis mucosae","weight":0.826391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscularis_mucosae"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.825048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Muscular layer","weight":0.738775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_layer"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.548165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.425758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.300994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.231976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Knife","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
