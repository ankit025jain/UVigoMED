{"id":65799,"title":"Prostate cancer: alcohol, cancer and 5?-reductase inhibitors-is there a link?","abstract":"Two major trials have been performed to determine the effect of 5?-reductase inhibitors on subsequent diagnoses of prostate cancer. Both trials showed that high alcohol intake significantly increased prostate cancer risk among men allocated to the treatment arms. The recommendation that patients eliminate alcohol when taking 5?-reductase inhibitors seems appropriate.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776974","annotations":[{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.625119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.302593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"}]}
