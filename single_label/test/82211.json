{"id":82211,"title":"An evaluation of periodontal assessment procedures among Indiana dental hygienists.","abstract":"Using a descriptive correlational design, this study surveyed periodontal assessment procedures currently performed by Indiana dental hygienists in general dentistry practices to reveal if deficiencies in assessment exist. Members (n = 354) of the Indiana Dental Hygienists' Association (IDHA) were invited to participate in the survey. A 22 multiple choice question survey, using Likert scales for responses, was open to participants for three weeks. Descriptive and non-parametric inferential statistics analyzed questions related to demographics and assessment procedures practiced. In addition, an evaluation of the awareness of periodontal assessment procedures recommended by the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) was examined. Of the 354 Indiana dental hygienists surveyed, a 31.9% response rate was achieved. Participants were asked to identify the recommended AAP periodontal assessment procedures they perform. The majority of respondents indicated either frequently or always performing the listed assessment procedures. Additionally, significant relationships were found between demographic factors and participants' awareness and performance of recommended AAP assessment procedures. While information gathered from this study is valuable to the body of literature regarding periodontal disease assessment, continued research with larger survey studies should be conducted to obtain a more accurate national representation of what is being practiced by dental hygienists.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683767","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.738373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.41452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.382248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Dental hygienist","weight":0.300212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_hygienist"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Multiple choice","weight":0.268992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_choice"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.104122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"American Academy of Periodontology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Periodontology"},{"name":"Statistical inference","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"354","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/354"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Esperanto literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_literature"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Italy national football team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team"},{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"American Academy of Pediatrics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Representation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 22","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_22"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
