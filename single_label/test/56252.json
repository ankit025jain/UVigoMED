{"id":56252,"title":"Salvaging ruins: reverting blind retinas into functional visual sensors.","abstract":"Blindness is one of the most devastating conditions affecting the quality of life. Hereditary degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, are characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors, leading to complete blindness. No treatment is known, the current state-of-the-art of restoring vision are implanted electrode arrays. As a recently discovered alternative, optical neuromodulators, such as channelrhodopsin, allow new strategies for treating these diseases by imparting light-sensitivity onto the remaining retinal neurons after photoreceptor cell death. Retinal degeneration is a heterogeneous set of diseases with diverse secondary effects on the retinal circuitry. Successful treatment strategies have to take into account this diversity, as only the existing retinal hardware can serve as substrate for optogenetic intervention. The goal is to salvage the retinal ruins and to revert the leftover tissue into a functional visual sensor that operates as optimally as possible. Here, we discuss three different successful approaches that have been applied to degenerated mouse retina.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718800","annotations":[{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Retinitis pigmentosa","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Channelrhodopsin","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelrhodopsin"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.708041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.663108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.599081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.358738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.234804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Phased array","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retinitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis"},{"name":"Electronic circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Multielectrode array","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multielectrode_array"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"}]}
