{"id":91437,"title":"Peroneus longus tears associated with pathology of the os peroneum.","abstract":"There is a range of different types of tears and pathology of the peroneal tendons. One of the least common types is the tear of the peroneus longus associated with fracture, enlargement, or entrapment at the cuboid tunnel of the os peroneum. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pathologic patterns of these uncommon peroneal tendon tears, to review the treatment, and to report the patient outcomes following treatment with excision of the os peroneum, debridement, and tenodesis of the peroneus longus to the peroneus brevis.A 5-year retrospective review of all patients with peroneal tendon tears identified 12 patients operatively treated for peroneus longus tendon tears with associated pathology of the os peroneum, and in whom there was a viable peroneus brevis. All patients were treated with an operative procedure consisting of excision of the os peroneum, debridement, and tenodesis of the peroneus longus to the peroneus brevis. Mean age was 51.5 (range, 33 to 73) years, including 7 males and 5 females. Operative and radiographic records were reviewed to characterize the nature of the peroneus longus tears and associated pathology. Preoperative and postoperative AOFAS hindfoot, SF-36 questionnaires, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores were compiled and patient records were reviewed for complications. Mean follow-up after surgery was 63.3 (range, 12 to 114) months.All of the patients had an os peroneum associated with a complex, irreparable tear of the peroneus longus tendon. The peroneus longus was typically enlarged, fibrotic, and adhered to the surrounding tissues. In 8 patients, the peroneus longus tendon tear was associated with a fracture of the os peroneum, and in 4 patients with an enlarged and entrapped os peroneum which prevented movement at the cuboid tunnel. Of the 12 patients, 9 had partial tears of the peroneus brevis, which were treated with debridement and suture repair. AOFAS hindfoot scores increased from a preoperative mean of 61 (range, 46 to 75) to a postoperative mean of 91.7 (range, 60 to 100). Mean preoperative SF-36 Physical Component Scores (PCS) increased from 36 to 52 postoperatively. Mean VAS pain scores decreased from a preoperative mean of 6.3 (range, 4 to 8) to a postoperative mean of 1.0 (range, 0 to 4). Complications included 2 patients with sural neuritis and 3 with superficial delayed wound healing successfully treated nonoperatively.Tears of the distal peroneus longus tendon, which are much less commonly reported than tears of the peroneus brevis, can be associated with pathology of the os peroneum. Excision of the os peroneum, tendon debridement, and tenodesis of the longus to brevis was an effective surgical technique.Level IV, case series.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505044","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.826578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.772623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.751207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.613327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.593882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.570497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.450483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.225096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Peroneus longus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_longus"},{"name":"Peroneus brevis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_brevis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_brevis_muscle"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Peroneus muscles","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_muscles"},{"name":"Nerve compression syndrome","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_compression_syndrome"}]}
