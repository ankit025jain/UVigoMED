{"id":87909,"title":"Left ventricle pseudoaneurysm in a transplanted heart from a car crash victim donor.","abstract":"Pseudoaneurysm is a very rare and unusual form of myocardial rupture, with complications such as chest trauma, inflammation, acute myocardial infarction, and infection. Although this rare complication has already been reported, it has never been found in a transplanted patient.We present the case of a 54-year-old women waiting on the urgent list who underwent heart transplantation. The donor of the organ died in a car accident. Although preoperative echocardiography had not revealed any signs of heart injury, a superficial small (3 Ã— 3 mm hematoma) was detected on harvesting. After implantation, intraoperative echocardiography was satisfactory, with no signs of wall motion disturbances, and left ventricle ejection fraction was estimated at 50%. The postoperative period was uneventful. Three weeks after surgery, a left ventricle pseudoaneurysm was found on routine MRI. The aneurysm wall consisted of only an epicardial layer. There was an 8-mm-wide gap in the myocardial wall next to the endocardium and with the width of 4 mm beneath the epicardium. On repeated MRI performed 3 months thereafter, the pseudoaneurysm was filled by thrombus.The presented case illustrates the necessity of careful inspection of the organ reported for transplantation from a donor who died from high-speed motor vehicle crash injuries. Additional diagnostic steps like MRI imaging are obligatory after transplantation, especially when the organ was harvested from a motor vehicle crash victim.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Wounds
