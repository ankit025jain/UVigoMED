{"id":55871,"title":"Comparison of two different ultrasound methods of phacoemulsification.","abstract":"To compare the safety and efficacy of microcoaxial phacoemulsification surgeries performed with the OZil Intelligent Phaco torsional mode (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, USA) and combined torsional/longitudinal ultrasound mode using 45 degree aperture angled tips.Prospective randomized clinical trial.setting: Maltepe University, Istanbul. patient population: Eighty eyes of 80 cataract patients were randomly assigned to 2.2 mm microcoaxial phacoemulsification using the OZil Intelligent Phaco torsional mode (Group 1) or combined torsional/longitudinal ultrasound mode (Group 2). observation procedure: Intraoperative fluid and energy usage and postoperative examinations were evaluated. main outcome measures: Ultrasound time, cumulative dissipated energy, longitudinal and torsional ultrasound amplitudes, mean operation time, mean volume of fluid used, and surgical complications.Both groups included 40 eyes. Mean ultrasound time, cumulative dissipated energy, and longitudinal and torsional ultrasound amplitudes in Group 1 were 58.21±33.81 seconds, 7.74±6.23, 0.45±0.30, and 26.30±12.60%, respectively, and these parameters in Group 2 were 64.75±30.23 seconds, 12.61±6.21, 26.32±5.85, and 40.98±8.33%, respectively. Cumulative dissipated energy and longitudinal and torsional amplitudes were found to be significantly lower in Group 1 (P=.001, P<.001, P<.001). Mean volumes of fluid used in Groups 1 and 2 were 73.30±19.87 cc and 107.07±21.82 cc, respectively (P<.001).With the aid of a 45 degree aperture angled tip, the OZil Intelligent Phaco torsional mode provided more effective lens removal than the combined torsional/longitudinal ultrasound mode, with a lower cumulative dissipated energy and volume of fluid used.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792106","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.86349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.516983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.415856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.167518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.162199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fort Worth, Texas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas"},{"name":"Torsional vibration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsional_vibration"},{"name":"Maltepe University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltepe_University"},{"name":"Istanbul","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"},{"name":"Alcon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcon"},{"name":"Aperture","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"325","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/325"},{"name":"988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/988"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Cubic centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Energy consumption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Dissipation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipation"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Probability amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude"},{"name":"No. 1 Group RAF","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._1_Group_RAF"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
