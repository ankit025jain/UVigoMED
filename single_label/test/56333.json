{"id":56333,"title":"Branch retinal artery occlusion after coil embolization of a paraclinoid aneurysm.","abstract":"The authors report a case of a 48-year-old woman with a branch retinal artery occlusion after the neurosurgical coiling of a paraclinoid aneurysm. Clinical examination revealed a Hollenhorst plaque at the bifurcation of the inferior arcade and at a branch of the superior arcade with associated retinal whitening in the right eye. Follow-up examination at 8 months demonstrated improved visual acuity with near complete resolution of the retinal infarction but a persistent inferior Hollenhorst plaque. This case illustrates a retinal artery occlusion as a possible complication of paraclinoid aneurysmal coiling procedure.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702760","annotations":[{"name":"Artery","weight":0.718951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.510032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.424048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.18608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0627255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Guglielmi Detachable Coil","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmi_Detachable_Coil"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Central retinal artery","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_artery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Coil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coil"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Atheroma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheroma"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
