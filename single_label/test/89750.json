{"id":89750,"title":"Update: Heat injuries, active component, U.S. Armed Forces, 2013.","abstract":"The number of active component service members treated for heat stroke in 2013 (n=324) was the lowest since 2010 (n=321). Incidence rates of heat stroke were higher among males, those younger than 20 years of age, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Marine Corps and Army members, recruit trainees, and service members in combat-specific occupations, compared to their respective counterparts. Fewer service members were treated for \"other heat injuries\" in 2013 (n=1,701) than in any other year of the 5-year surveillance period. In addition, there were fewer reportable medical events, ambulatory encounters, and hospitalizations for \"other heat injuries\" in 2013 than in any of the prior 4 years. The incidence rate of \"other heat injuries\" was higher among females than males and 304 percent higher among recruit trainees than among other enlisted members or officers. During 2009-2013, a total of 909 heat injury events occurred in Iraq/Afghanistan; 6.4 percent (n=58) of those events were due to heat stroke.
