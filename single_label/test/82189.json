{"id":82189,"title":"Evaluation of radioprotective effect of pilocarpine ingestion on salivary glands.","abstract":"There is controversy concerning the effect of pilocarpine in the reversal of radio-induced xerostomia; however, the tests are usually performed at the end of radiotherapy. The present study evaluated the radioprotective effects of pilocarpine when ingested during radiation treatment. Eleven patients (recently diagnosed with head and neck cancer who were not undergoing radiotherapy) were divided into two groups: the control group (saline solution intake n=6) and the pilocarpine-treated (5 mg pilocarpine three times daily, n=5) group, in a prospective and double-blinded study. For five weeks, oral conditions, unstimulated salivary flow and stimulated saliva flow were collected weekly, with the first collection occurring prior to radiation therapy. As early as the second week, the control group exhibited oral complications and greater reduction in salivary flow rate. At the end of the study, the pilocarpine-treated group presented mean values of salivary flow greater than those of the control group. Pilocarpine intake applied simultaneously with radiotherapy demonstrated encouraging results with regard to lowering salivary flow reduction and incidence of xerostomia, as well as of oral complications.
