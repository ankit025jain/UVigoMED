{"id":71625,"title":"[Sonographic appearance of benign subcutaneous nodules--including color Doppler sonography].","abstract":"Color Doppler sonography is used to distinguish malignant from benign subcutaneous nodules because many malignant tumors show an increased number of vessels. But benign lesions, such as inflammatory epidermal cysts, pilomatricomas, palmoplantar fibromatoses show vascular flow signals. We analyze diagnostic factors for subcutaneous nodules on the basis of ultrasonographic appearance including color Doppler sonography.We evaluated with sonography 79 subcutaneous nodules in histopathologically proven cases.The diagnostic findings for 28 epidermal cysts were increased posterior echo(sensitivity 77%, specificity 90%). Vascular flow signals were seen in 7 cases(25%). The signals were seen from periphery to adjacent zone of the mass. They were accompanied by inflammatory granulation tissues histologically. The percentage of blood flow may be related to the percentage of \"ruptured\" epidermal cysts. Pilomatricomas (n = 9) had internal echogenic foci or Doppler flow signals, and no posterior enhancement (sensitivity 89%, specificity 78%). Seven pilomatricomas showed Doppler flow signals in the mass. The percentage of flow signals is explained by the degree of internal echogenic foci because remarkable calcium deposits producing posterior acoustic shadowing prevent us from flow signals. Palmoplantar fibromatoses (n = 5) were ill-defined margins and showed internal vascularity with no posterior enhancement (sensitivity 80%, specificity 94%).More benign lesions showed vascular flow signals than reported previously. We have to diagnose subcutaneous nodules referring to not only color Doppler but also gray scale sonography.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051657","annotations":[{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.700994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.700676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.63136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.596261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Fibromatosis","weight":0.416268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromatosis"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.285466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.279307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.253955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Vessels","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vessels"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"}]}
