{"id":46320,"title":"N-cadherin and P-cadherin are biomarkers for invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis of gallbladder carcinomas.","abstract":"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare, but highly aggressive cancer. The most common type of gallbladder cancer is adenocarcinoma (AC), while squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinoma (SC/ASC) is a rare type of gallbladder cancer. The clinicopathologic and biological characteristics of SC/ASC have not been well documented. In this study, the protein expression of N-cadherin and P-cadherin in 46 SC/ASCs and 80 ACs was measured using immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression were significantly associated with large tumor size, invasion, and lymph node metastasis of both SC/ASC and AC. In contrast, positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression were significantly associated with differentiation and TNM stage in only AC. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression, differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage, invasion, lymph node metastasis, and surgical curability were significantly associated with overall survival in both SC/ASC and AC patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression are independent poor-prognostic factors in both SC/ASC and AC patients. Our study suggested that positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression closely correlated with clinicopathological and biological behaviors, and poor-prognosis of gallbladder cancer.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636838","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.738002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.709591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.675808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.539713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.187497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.126504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"}]}
