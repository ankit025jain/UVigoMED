{"id":44074,"title":"Transarterial (chemo)embolization for curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analyses.","abstract":"To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of transarterial embolization (TAE) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The authors conducted an extensive search of studies on this strategy. All randomized controlled trials comparing TACE or TAE plus operation versus operation only were considered for inclusion, regardless of blinding, language, or publication status. Results were performed with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint. Tumor response and adverse events were secondary endpoints.A total of 10 studies involving 909 HCC participants finally fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria. Four trials assessed preoperative TACE versus control and six trials assessed postoperative TACE versus control. There were significant improvements for DFS [HR 0.62 (95 % CI 0.49-0.79)] and OS [HR 0.60 (0.46-0.79)] in the postoperative TACE compared with the control when the mean tumor size was bigger than 5 cm. However, preoperative TACE did not improve DFS [HR 0.92 (0.71-1.20)] and OS [HR 1.07 (0.78-1.46)] for curative resection of HCC. Substantial differences in criteria for assessing tumor response did not allow quantitative analyses. Fever (26.7-85.9 %), abdominal pain (19.3-71.2 %), and nausea/vomiting (27.4-66.3 %) were common adverse events. Relatively rare but more serious complications were also reported.Postoperative TACE offers potential benefits for curative resection of HCC when the mean tumor size is bigger than 5 cm.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752339","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.809477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.745333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.510535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.417041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.403791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.23879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"End point of clinical trials","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_point_of_clinical_trials"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"781","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/781"},{"name":"785","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/785"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"909","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909"},{"name":"371","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/371"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Numerical data","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_data"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Substantial (rapper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_(rapper)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
