{"id":36600,"title":"Escalating doses of C1 esterase inhibitor (CINRYZE) for prophylaxis in patients with hereditary angioedema.","abstract":"Nanofiltered C1 inhibitor (human) is approved in the United States for routine prophylaxis of angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema, a rare disease caused by a deficiency of functional C1 inhibitor.To assess the safety of escalating doses of nanofiltered C1 inhibitor (human) in patients who were not adequately controlled on the indicated dose (1000 U every 3 or 4 days).Eligible patients had >1 attack/month over the 3 months before the trial. Doses were escalated to 1500 U every 3 or 4 days for 12 weeks, at which point, the patients were evaluated. If treatment was successful (?1 attack/mo) or at the investigator's discretion, the patients entered a 3-month follow-up period. The patients with an average of >1 attack/month were eligible for further escalation to 2000 U and then 2500 U.Twenty patients started at 1500 U; 13 were escalated to 2000 U, and 12 were escalated to 2500 U. Eighteen patients reported adverse events. Two patients reported 4 serious adverse events (cerebral cystic hygroma, laryngeal angioedema attack, anemia, and bile duct stone) that were considered by investigators to be unrelated to treatment. Notably, there were no systemic thrombotic events or discontinuations due to adverse events. Fourteen patients were treated successfully (70%), continued to the follow-up period at the investigator's discretion, or experienced a reduction in attacks of >1.0/month.Dose escalation of nanofiltered C1 inhibitor (human) up to 2500 U was well tolerated and reduced attack frequency in the majority of patients.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565773","annotations":[{"name":"Angioedema","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.774202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.761251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.675823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.611753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.529832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.343394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.164317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.162483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Esterase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esterase"},{"name":"Cystic hygroma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_hygroma"},{"name":"C1-inhibitor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C1-inhibitor"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"Escalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Discretion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretion"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
