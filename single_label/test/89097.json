{"id":89097,"title":"Current indications for and the technique of wrist arthroscopy.","abstract":"Since its introduction more than 30 years ago, wrist arthroscopy has become an essential diagnostic and therapeutic tool in hand surgery. This procedure minimizes exposures and allows access to otherwise remotely located anatomic regions with minimal morbidity. Advances in anatomic understanding and wrist scope technology have standardized the procedure and expanded indications. Current applications are diagnostic staging of various wrist pathologies where arthroscopy allows for a direct, magnified, and tactile-assisted examination. This includes injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), osteochondral lesion of the carpus, and dynamic assessment of carpal instability and radiocarpal arthritis. Therapeutic applications have continued to expand and include arthroscopic-assisted fracture reductions, treatment of radiocarpal synovitis and arthritis, TFCC repairs, and arthroscopic management of soft tissue pathologies such as ganglion excisions and release of contractures.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754550","annotations":[{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.706565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hand surgery","weight":0.627131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_surgery"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.488002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.450612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.377895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Fibrocartilage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrocartilage"},{"name":"Synovitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Breast reduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reduction"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Osteochondrosis","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrosis"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
