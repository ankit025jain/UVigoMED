{"id":91336,"title":"Viscoelastic guidance of resuscitation.","abstract":"Bleeding in trauma carries a high mortality and is increased in case of coagulopathy. Our understanding of hemostasis and coagulopathy has improved, leading to a change in the protocols for hemostatic monitoring. This review describes the current state of evidence supporting the use of viscoelastic hemostatic assays to guide trauma resuscitation.Viscoelastic hemostatic assays such as thrombelastography and rotational thrombelastometry have shown to reduce bleeding, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets, and possibly mortality in different surgical populations. In trauma care, viscoelastic hemostatic assays allows for rapid and timely identification of coagulopathy and individualized, goal-directed transfusion therapy. As part of the resuscitation concept, viscoelastic hemostatic assays seem to improve outcome also in trauma; however, there is a need for randomized clinical trials to confirm this.We are moving toward avoiding coagulopathy by individualized, goal-directed transfusion therapy, using viscoelastic hemostatic assays to guide ongoing resuscitation of actively bleeding patients in a goal-directed manner.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24514038","annotations":[{"name":"Fresh frozen plasma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_frozen_plasma"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.748144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.683844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.478155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.392779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Viscoelasticity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity"},{"name":"Thromboelastography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboelastography"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Frozen food","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_food"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"}]}
