{"id":73376,"title":"C-FLIP(L) contributes to TRAIL resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer.","abstract":"Breast cancers with HER2 amplification have a poorer prognosis than the luminal phenotypes. TRAIL activates apoptosis upon binding its receptors in some but not all breast cancer cell lines. Herein, we investigated the expression pattern of c-FLIP(L) in a cohort of 251 invasive breast cancer tissues and explored its potential role in TRAIL resistance. C-FLIP(L) was relatively high-expressed in HER2-positive breast cancer in comparison with other molecular subtypes, co-expressed with TRAIL death receptors, and inversely correlated with the apoptosis index. Downregulation of c-FLIP(L) sensitized SKBR3 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and enhanced the activities and cleavages of caspase-8 and caspase-3, without altering the surface expression of death receptors. Together, our results indicate that c-FLIP(L) promotes TRAIL resistance and inhibits caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation in HER2-positive breast cancer.
