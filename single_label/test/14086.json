{"id":14086,"title":"Development of a cyclic voltammetry method for the detection of Clostridium novyi in black disease.","abstract":"Black disease is an acute disease of sheep and cattle. The pathogen is the obligate anaerobe, Clostridium novyi. Due to difficulties of anaerobic culturing in the country or disaster sites, a simple, rapid, and sensitive method is required. In this study, an electrochemical method, the cyclic voltammetry method, basing on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), electrochemical ion bonding (positive dye, methylene blue), was introduced. DNA extracted from C. novyi specimens was amplified through the LAMP reaction. Then the products combined were with methylene blue, which lead to a reduction in the oxidation peak current (ipA) and the reduction peak current (ipC) of the cyclic voltammetry. The changes of ipA/ipC were real-time measured by special designed electrode, so the DNA was quantitatively detected. The results displayed that this electrochemical detection of C. novyi could be completed in 1-2 h with the lowest bacterial concentration of 10(2) colony forming units/mL, and high accuracy (96.5%), sensitivity (96%), and specificity (97%) compared to polymerase chain reation. The cyclic voltammetry method was a simple and fast method, with high sensitivity and high specificity, and has great potential to be a usable molecular tool for fast diagnosis of Black disease.
