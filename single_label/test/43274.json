{"id":43274,"title":"Modulation of miR-29 expression by ?-fetoprotein is linked to the hepatocellular carcinoma epigenome.","abstract":"Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70%-85% of primary liver cancers and ranks as the second leading cause of male cancer death. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), normally highly expressed in the liver only during fetal development, is reactivated in 60% of HCC tumors and associated with poor patient outcome. We hypothesize that AFP+ and AFP- tumors differ biologically. Multivariable analysis in 237 HCC cases demonstrates that AFP level predicts poor survival independent of tumor stage (P<0.043). Using microarray-based global microRNA (miRNA) profiling, we found that miRNA-29 (miR-29) family members were the most significantly (P<0.001) down-regulated miRNAs in AFP+ tumors. Consistent with miR-29's role in targeting DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), a key enzyme regulating DNA methylation, we found a significant inverse correlation (P<0.001) between miR-29 and DNMT3A gene expression, suggesting that they might be functionally antagonistic. Moreover, global DNA methylation profiling reveals that AFP+ and AFP- HCC tumors have distinct global DNA methylation patterns and that increased DNA methylation is associated with AFP+ HCC. Experimentally, we found that AFP expression in AFP- HCC cells induces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of AFP, or conditioned media from AFP+ cells, inhibits miR-29a expression and induces DNMT3A expression in AFP- HCC cells. AFP also inhibited transcription of the miR-29a/b-1 locus, and this effect is mediated through c-MYC binding to the transcript of miR-29a/b-1. Furthermore, AFP expression promotes tumor growth of AFP- HCC cells in nude mice.Tumor biology differs considerably between AFP+ HCC and AFP- HCC; AFP is a functional antagonist of miR-29, which may contribute to global epigenetic alterations and poor prognosis in HCC.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Digestive System
