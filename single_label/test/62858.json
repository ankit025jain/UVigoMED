{"id":62858,"title":"Stratification of treatment intensity in relapsed pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"Risk-adapted, response-based therapies for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma have resulted in 5-year survival exceeding 90%. Although high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) are considered standard for most patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, a subset of children with low risk relapse do not require AHSCT for cure. Currently there are no widely accepted criteria defining who should receive standard dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, nor is there a standardized treatment regimen. We propose a risk-stratified, response-based algorithm for children with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma that is based on a critical appraisal of published outcomes and prognostic factors.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504790","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.610571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.267874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Real estate appraisal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
