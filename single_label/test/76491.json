{"id":76491,"title":"Thrombolysis in experimental cerebral amyloid angiopathy and the risk of secondary intracerebral hemorrhage.","abstract":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most adverse event of thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy increases the risk for spontaneous lobar ICH. Although thrombolysis may be performed in cerebral amyloid angiopathy-affected patients, there is still little knowledge available on the risk for secondary ICH.We investigated the effect of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator on experimental ischemic stroke in APP23 transgenic mice (n=18) and wild-type littermates (n=15). Focal ischemic stroke was induced in 26-month-old mice by temporal middle cerebral artery occlusion (filament model), followed by treatment with 10 mg/kg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. Twenty-four hours later, a functional score was assessed and the mice were euthanized for histological analysis. ICH was classified as grades 1 to 3 depending on severity.The groups did not differ regarding mortality (P=0.67) and functional deficit (P=0.18). Compared with wild-type mice, the APP23 genotype was associated with a higher appearance for ICH in the infarct area (P=0.05). ICH severity grades 2 and 3 correlated significantly with infarct size (P=0.004 and 0.008, respectively).The APP23 genotype was not associated with increased mortality or worse functional outcome. Our results suggest an increased risk for ICH in the cerebral amyloid angiopathy-affected brain; however, no ICH was observed outside the ischemic area.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005438","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral hemorrhage","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.86498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.742283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.730461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy","weight":0.717039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_amyloid_angiopathy"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.656824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.634476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Angiopathy","weight":0.482072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiopathy"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.215256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.11796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0976771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Amyloid precursor protein","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_precursor_protein"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
