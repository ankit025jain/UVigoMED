{"id":42814,"title":"Pathological analysis of extracapsular extension of metastatic lymph node and its potential impact on nodal clinical target volume in the radiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"There is no consensus regarding the clinical target volume (CTV) margins which surround the gross tumor volume of metastatic lymph nodes (LN) in radiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This study retrospectively assessed the distance of extracapsular extension (ECE) of metastatic LN in thoracic ESCC and defined nodal CTV margins. Histological sections of metastatic LNs from 217 patients with thoracic ESCC were re-examined. The incidence and maximal distance of ECE of metastatic LNs were assessed. The relationships between ECE and clinicopathologic features were also investigated. The ECE was found in 37.3% of patients (81/217) and 23.1% of metastatic LN (159/689), and the incidences had a significant relationship with N stage and LN size. The median distance of ECE was 1.0 mm (range, 0.2-9.7 mm). The distance of ECE showed a positive correlation with LN size (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.419; p<0.001). The ECE distances of LN with <10 mm diameter were significantly smaller than LN with 10-30 mm diameter (p<0.001). The 95th percentiles of ECE distances for these two groups were 3 mm and 5 mm, respectively. For pathologic LN <10 mm in diameter, a 3-mm CTV margin appears to be adequate to encompass 95% of the microscopic ECE, and for LN 10-30 mm, a 5-mm CTV margin is recommended.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824935","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.623806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.530327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.480357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.452072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.409985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.372682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
