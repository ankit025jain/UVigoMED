{"id":15090,"title":"[Cycloferon biological activity characteristics].","abstract":"Study the effect of cycloferon in experimental and clinical conditions on persistence properties of aurococci as well as features of their morpho-functional reaction by atomic force microscopy.The study was carried out in 12 Staphylococcus aureus clones isolated from mucous membrane of nose anterior part of a resident carrier. The effect of cycloferon in vivo was evaluated in 26 resident staphylococci carriers under the control of anti-carnosine activity of staphylococci. Anti-carnosine activity was determined by O.V. Bukharin et al. (1999), biofilm formation -by G.A. O'Toole et al. (2000). Staphylococci treated with cycloferon were studied by atomic force microscopy in contact mode using scanning probe SMM-2000 microscope.The decrease of persistence properties of staphylococci under the effect of cycloferon in vitro and in vivo may be examined as one of the mechanisms of biological activity of the preparation. A significant increase of S. aureus surface roughness and changes in their morphology under the effect of cycloferon allow stating the disorder of barrier functions in the aurococci cell wall.The data obtained expand the understanding of cycloferon biological activity mechanisms.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286535","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Cell wall","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall"},{"name":"Atomic force microscopy","weight":0.805928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.75895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.706565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.684639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.632087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.59689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.466709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.383001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Scanning probe microscopy","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Atom","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
