{"id":64689,"title":"Isolation of healthy individuals' and rheumatoid arthritis patients' peripheral blood neutrophils by the gelatin and Ficoll-Hypaque methods: comparative efficiency and impact on the neutrophil oxidative metabolism and Fc? receptor expression.","abstract":"In vitro assessment of the functional responses of leukocytes sometimes requires their isolation from blood, joint and tissues. In this study, we compared the efficiency of two procedures - the gelatin method and Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation gradient - to isolate peripheral blood neutrophils of healthy individuals and patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We also assessed whether these procedures affect the neutrophil activation status. Both purification procedures were concluded in 90min, and yielded cell populations with similar degrees of purity (80-90%), number of neutrophils (1-2Ã—10(6) cells per mL of blood), and viability (97-100%). In vitro neutrophil priming with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) significantly increased the reactive oxygen species producing ability of the cells stimulated with n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (n-fMLP), soluble immune complexes (s-ICs), and insoluble immune complexes (i-ICs). Isolated neutrophils not treated with GM-CSF responded to n-fMLP and i-IC, but not to s-IC. Almost all of the neutrophils (98-100%) purified by both methods expressed Fc?RII/CD32 and Fc?RIII/CD16, but they did not express significant levels of Fc?RI/CD64. Similar results were obtained for healthy individuals' and RA patients' neutrophils. In summary, the gelatin method was comparable to Ficoll-Hypaque gradient in terms of purity, yield, and viability of the neutrophil preparations. Both methods neither primed or activated the neutrophils, nor affected their functional responsiveness. Therefore, both methods are suitable to isolate peripheral blood neutrophils of healthy individuals and RA patients.
