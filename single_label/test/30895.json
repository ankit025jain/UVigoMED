{"id":30895,"title":"DSM-5 latent classes of alcohol users in a population-based sample: results from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey, Brazil.","abstract":"We aimed to identify different categorical phenotypes based upon the DSM-V criteria of alcohol use disorders (AUD) among alcohol users who had at least one drink per week in the past year (n=948).Data are from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey collected in 2005-2007, as part of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative. A latent class analysis of the 11 DSM-5-AUD criteria was performed using Mplus, taking into account complex survey design features. Weighted logistic regression models were used to examine demographic correlates of the DSM-5-AUD latent classes.The best latent-class model was a three-class model. We found a \"non-symptomatic class\" (69.7%), a \"use in larger amounts class\" (23.2%), defined by high probability (>70%) of the \"use in larger amounts\" criterion only, and a \"high-moderate symptomatic class\" (7.1%), defined by high-moderate probability of all the 11 AUD criteria. Compared to those in the non-symptomatic class, individuals in the \"high-moderate symptomatic class\" were more likely to have been married, have lower educational attainment and to be unemployed or in non-regular/informal employment. Those on the \"use in larger amounts class\" were more likely to have been married or never married.The two symptomatic classes clearly represented the dimensionality of the new proposed AUD criteria, and could be more specifically targeted by different prevention or treatment strategies. DSM-5-AUD has the advantage of shedding light on risky drinkers included in the \"use in larger amounts class\", allowing for preventive interventions, which will reach a large number of individuals.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440273","annotations":[{"name":"Mental
