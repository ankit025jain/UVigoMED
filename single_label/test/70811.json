{"id":70811,"title":"Transcriptional regulation of the intestinal nuclear bile acid farnesoid X receptor (FXR) by the caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2).","abstract":"Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is a bile acid-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is highly expressed in the enterohepatic system, where it senses bile acid levels to consequently reduce their synthesis while inducing their detoxification. Bile acids are intestinal tumor promoters and their concentrations have to be tightly regulated. Indeed, reduced expression of FXR in the intestine increases colorectal cancer susceptibility in mice, whereas its activation can promote apoptosis in genetically modified cells. Notably, despite the broad knowledge of the FXR enterohepatic transcriptional activity, the molecular mechanisms regulating FXR expression in the intestine are still unknown. Herein, by combining both gain and loss of function approaches and FXR promoter activity studies, we identified caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2) transcription factor as a positive regulator of FXR expression in the enterocytes. Our results provide a putative novel tool for modulating FXR expression against bile acid-related colorectal cancer progression.
