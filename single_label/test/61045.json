{"id":61045,"title":"Does discharge hemoglobin affect medium-term survival after coronary bypass?","abstract":"the effect of discharge hemoglobin on survival of patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting is unknown. Blood transfusion frequently confounds the issue.4682 consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass were studied. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify whether discharge hemoglobin was an independent risk factor determining survival after isolated coronary artery bypass. The analysis was complemented with a neuronal network.univariate analysis identified discharge hemoglobin (p = 0.01) and blood transfusion (p < 0.0001) as significant factors affecting survival. Multivariate analysis identified age (p < 0.0001) ejection fraction (p < 0.0001), dialysis (p < 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.001), preoperative hemoglobin (p = 0.01), and blood transfusion (p = 0.0002) as significant factors determining survival. Neuronal network analysis confirmed the lack of importance of hemoglobin on discharge as a factor determining survival.the discharge hemoglobin level does not affect medium-term survival.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771731","annotations":[{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.900392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.87691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.863551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.728095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.700897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.582342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.28521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"}]}
