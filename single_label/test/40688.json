{"id":40688,"title":"Sildenafil attenuates hepatocellular injury after liver ischemia reperfusion in rats: a preliminary study.","abstract":"We evaluated the role of sildenafil in a rat liver ischemia-reperfusion model. Forty male rats were randomly allocated in four groups. The sham group underwent midline laparotomy only. In the sildenafil group, sildenafil was administered intraperitoneally 60 minutes before sham laparotomy. In the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) group, rats were subjected to 45 minutes of hepatic ischemia followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion, while in the sild+I/R group rats were subjected to a similar pattern of I/R after the administration of sildenafil, 60 minutes before ischemia. Two hours after reperfusion, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured and histopathological examination of the lobes subjected to ischemia as well as TUNEL staining for apoptotic bodies was performed. Additionally, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were analyzed. Serum markers of hepatocellular injury were significantly lower in the sild+I/R group, which also exhibited lower severity of histopathological lesions and fewer apoptotic bodies, as compared to the I/R group. The I/R group showed significantly higher MPO activity and higher expression of ICAM-1, as compared to the sild+I/R group. Use of sildenafil as a preconditioning agent in a rat model of liver I/R exerted a protective effect.
