{"id":2037,"title":"[Influence of ursodeoxycholic acid on the immune status of patients with cholesterosis of gall-bladder depending on cholesterol index in blood].","abstract":"Application of ursodeoxycholic acid in a standard dosage for 3 months provided a positive effect in relation to the indexes of the immune system for patients with the cholesterosis of gall-bladder. It is shown that medicine assists renewal of T-cell immunity, renders positive influence on B-link and renewal of index of immunoregulation can be seen. Reliable increase of specific receptors to CD25, HLA-DR and high level of CD95 testifies about including of the scray reaction of organism under influence of ursodeoxycholic acid on the remaining high indexes of B-cell of immunity. At the initial indexes of lipid spectrum, corresponding to the norm, the efficiency of normalization of immunological changes is more considerable than at the higher level of general cholesterol of serum of blood.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518458","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.734118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.642946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.594102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.590333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.409965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ursodiol","weight":0.151923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursodiol"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.145948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Fas receptor","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_receptor"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"}]}
