{"id":29851,"title":"[Caring for people with psychoactive substance dependence: nursing student perceptions].","abstract":"This was a qualitative exploratory study aiming to better understand the perceptions of student nurses regarding care of the chemically dependent. Semistructured interviews were conducted between 2007 and 2009 with 17 nursing students from a public university in the city of SÃ£o Paulo who were training in specialized services for abusers of alcohol and drugs. The content analysis technique was used, and the discourse evaluation revealed that care for the chemically dependent was considered interesting but difficult and exhausting. A positive outcome noted by the students was that the discussion of theory and experience enabled them to change their perceptions of the issue from a moral model base to a more technical, scientific and ethical one. It was concluded that this teaching strategy can contribute to changing the perceptions of nurses toward these patients.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601145","annotations":[{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.791621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.732987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"University","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.673986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.409965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Moral","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Public university","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Discourse","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Content analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"SWAT","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"}]}
