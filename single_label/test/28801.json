{"id":28801,"title":"[Research on Chinese medicine pairs (IV)--Their compatibility effects].","abstract":"Chinese medicine pairs (CMP) are specific compatibility with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory as principle, which was formed on basis of effect and treatment theory of TCM. The compatibility of CMP can enhance the effect, or reduce the toxicity. So, compatibility effects of CMP were studied from different pharmacology levels including animals, tissues and organs, cell and molecular levels, their synergy and compatibility attenuation were also evaluated with monomer component-component (group) compatibility-single herb-CMP-formulae as the main line, and the action mechanisms were investigated, all of which can provide scientific basis for the clinical applications of CMP and creation of TCM new drugs.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791517","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.514079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"China","weight":0.442665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Monomer","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Zoosadism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoosadism"},{"name":"Cytidine monophosphate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytidine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Main line (railway)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_line_(railway)"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
