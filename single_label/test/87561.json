{"id":87561,"title":"Legal risk management and injury in the fitness industry: the outcomes of focus group research and a national survey of fitness professionals.","abstract":"The Australian Fitness Industry Risk Management (AFIRM) Project was set up to explore the operation of rules and regulations for the delivery of safe fitness services. This article summarises the results of recent focus group research and a national survey of risk management practices by the AFIRM Project. Our focus group research in four States identified the following most important concerns: (1) the competency of fitness professionals; (2) the effectiveness of pre-exercise screening and the management of de-conditioned clients; (3) poor supervision of fitness service users and incorrect use of equipment; (4) fitness trainers failing to remain within their scope of practice; (5) equipment misuse (as distinct from incorrect use); and (6) poor fitness training environments. This information was then used to develop 45 specific items for a questionnaire that was disseminated throughout the fitness industry. The survey, which is the largest ever conducted in the Australian fitness industry (n = 1,178), identified similar concerns. Our research indicates that efforts to improve risk management in the fitness industry should focus, first and foremost, on the development and monitoring of safety policy, and improvements in the education and training of fitness instructors to ensure that they can incorporate risk management practices.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087365","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.713313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.699192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.444596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.381229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Customer","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"The Australian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"},{"name":"Athletic trainer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_trainer"},{"name":"Scope (project management)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(project_management)"},{"name":"Scope of practice","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_of_practice"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Legal risk","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_risk"}]}
