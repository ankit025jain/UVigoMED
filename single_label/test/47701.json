{"id":47701,"title":"Postoperative outcomes of primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinomas: review article.","abstract":"We examined the course of a primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (PHNEC) patient and analyzed the postoperative outcome of all reported PHNEC cases.A literature search for PHNEC cases was performed using PubMed. All reported cases and our present patient were analyzed in this study. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for the recurrence of PHNEC following hepatic resection were investigated.A total of 43 patients were analyzed in this study. The 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates were 55%, 48%, and 48%, respectively. The 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates in surgery patients were 78% each, and 25%, 17%, and 17%, respectively in nonsurgery patients. Lymph node metastasis posed a significant risk factor for postoperative recurrence.Hepatic surgery is an appropriate therapeutic treatment for PHNEC without distant metastasis nor lymph node metastasis. Adjuvant chemotherapy might be necessary for PHNEC patients with lymph node metastases.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575586","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.805736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.699309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.648615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.144869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
