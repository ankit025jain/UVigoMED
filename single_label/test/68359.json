{"id":68359,"title":"Dickkopf-1 levels in Turkish patients with bladder cancer and its association with clinicopathological features.","abstract":"Evidence indicates that Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) levels may be a biomarker for cancer risk. The aim of this study was to assess DKK-1 and its correlation with clinic-pathological features in patients with bladder cancer.DKK-1 levels were determined in serum samples from 90 patients with bladder cancer before transurethral tumor resection. The concentrations of DKK-1 were determined by using enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).Elevated preoperative DKK-1 levels were associated with tumor stage (p<0.001), grade (p<0.001) and histological grade (p<0.001).The results of our study demonstrated that the level of serum DKK-1 is correlated with both disease progression and increase in the tumor grade. Preoperative serum DKK-1 elevation may thus represent a novel marker for the determination of bladder cancer and the detection of patients with a likely poor clinical outcome.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528060","annotations":[{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.888684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.711368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.594493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.580828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.575724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.291125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.275698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.24992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Danish krone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_krone"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0187256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
