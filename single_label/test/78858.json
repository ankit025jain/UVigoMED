{"id":78858,"title":"Evidence-based surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps.","abstract":"Meta-analysis of both large outcome studies as well as cohort studies support the safety and efficacy of Endoscopic Sinus Surgery for Chronic Rhinosinusitis. The efficacy of endoscopic sinus surgery is demonstrated in the improvement of both disease-specific and generic QOL as well as objective measures. However, this must be interpreted together with a well-recognized long-term 15-20Â % revision rate, seen more often in patients with ASA trias and cystic fibrosis as well as osteitis and previous surgery. The effect of surgery is higher in managing nasal obstruction (effect size 1.7) and less so hyposmia (effect size 0.8). Allergy has an additive role on the symptomatology of CRS; however, its role if any on the outcome of ESS for CRS is unclear. The concurrent presence of aspiring sensitivity and asthma is associated with increased disease burden and more revision surgeries. Improved phenotyping of CRS may lead in the future to better tailoring of surgical treatments.
