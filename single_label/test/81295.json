{"id":81295,"title":"Mineral content of ionomer cements and preventive effect of these cements against white spot lesions around restorations.","abstract":"This study evaluated the ion exchange at the material/enamel interface and the preventive effect of restorative materials submitted to cariogenic challenge against white spot. Restorations in enamel/dentin of bovine teeth were performed with composite resin (Filtek™ Z250 - control group) and glass-ionomers cements - GICs (Ionomaster R™ and Fuji IX™ - experimental groups). Samples were grouped and submitted to neutral saliva (n = 15) or pH-cycling regimen (n = 15). After eight days of pH cycling, material/enamel interfaces were analyzed by EDX in order to determine the differences (p < 0.05) in ionic exchange (Ca, P, F, Al, Sr, and Si) between restorative materials and teeth. In addition, enamel white spot lesion formation was evaluated macroscopically (p < 0.05). Sr content was higher in the enamel of the control group (p > 0.05) versus the experimental groups. Ca and P content were higher in enamel than in restorative materials. After pH cycling, the GIC enamel bulk showed a significantly higher Sr content compared with the composite resin (p < 0.05). Filtek™ Z250 was not able to prevent white spot formation around restorations in comparison with Ionomaster R™ (p < 0.001) and Fuji IX™ (p = 0.004). GICs reduced white spot formation and presented a preventive effect (p = 0.051). GICs presented a greater percentage of fluoride, aluminum, and strontium, and proved effective in white spot lesion prevention around restorations.
