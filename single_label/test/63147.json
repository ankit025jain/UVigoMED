{"id":63147,"title":"Risk of leukemia in relation to exposure to ambient air toxics in pregnancy and early childhood.","abstract":"There are few established causes of leukemia, the most common type of cancer in children. Studies in adults suggest a role for specific environmental agents, but little is known about any effect from exposures in pregnancy to toxics in ambient air. In our case-control study, we ascertained 69 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 46 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from California Cancer Registry records of children <age 6, and 19,209 controls from California birth records within 2 km (1.3 miles) (ALL) and 6 km (3.8 miles) (AML) of an air toxics monitoring station between 1990 and 2007. Information on air toxics exposures was taken from community air monitors. We used logistic regression to estimate the risk of leukemia associated with one interquartile range increase in air toxic exposure. Risk of ALL was elevated with 3(rd) trimester exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OR=1.16, 95% CI 1.04, 1.29), arsenic (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.02, 1.73), benzene (OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.08, 2.09), and three other toxics related to fuel combustion. Risk of AML was increased with 3rd trimester exposure to chloroform (OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.00, 1.69), benzene (1.75, 95% CI 1.04, 2.93), and two other traffic-related toxics. During the child's first year, exposure to butadiene, ortho-xylene, and toluene increased risk for AML and exposure to selenium increased risk for ALL. Benzene is an established cause of leukemia in adults; this study supports that ambient exposures to this and other chemicals in pregnancy and early life may also increase leukemia risk in children.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472648","annotations":[{"name":"Toluene","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene"},{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.884636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Benzene","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.803822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"1,3-Butadiene","weight":0.672162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,3-Butadiene"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.563321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Fuel","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"},{"name":"California","weight":0.417848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Polycyclic compound","weight":0.331976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_compound"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.188519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Kilometre","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Controlled-access highway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway"}]}
