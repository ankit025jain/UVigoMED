{"id":72892,"title":"Antiproliferative activity and induction of apoptotic by ethanolic extract of Alpinia galanga rhizhome in human breast carcinoma cell line.","abstract":"We investigated the potential of galangal rhizomes to induce cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in the cultured human breast carcinoma cell line, (MCF-7) in compare with the non-malignant (MRC-5) cells.Both cells were cultured in DMEM medium and treated with galangal rhizomes for three consecutive days. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry using Annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate.The results showed that the ethanolic extract of galangal rhizomes decreased cell viability in the malignant cells as a concentration- and time- dependent manner. The IC50 values against MCF-7 were determined at 400.0 ± 11.7 and 170.0 ± 5.9 ?g/ml after 48 and 72 h respectively. The morphology of MCF-7 cells treated with the ethanolic extract confirmed the cell proliferation assay results. Alpinia galanga induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, as determined by flow cytometry.We concluded that the extract of Alpinia galanga exerts pro-apoptotic effects in a breast cancer-derived cell line and could be considered as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935101","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Isothiocyanate","weight":0.789526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothiocyanate"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.673635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.659219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.566181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.524765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.407416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.255405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medical Research Council (UK)","weight":0.198175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council_(UK)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Rhizome","weight":0.119684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome"},{"name":"Fluorescein isothiocyanate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_isothiocyanate"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Inductive effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_effect"}]}
