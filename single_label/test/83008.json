{"id":83008,"title":"Management of internal resorption of central incisor using hybrid technique.","abstract":"Internal inflammatory root resorption is characterised by progressive destruction of intraradicular dentin and dentinal tubules along the root canal wall. A number of theories have been proposed as a possible cause for internal resorption. It is usually asymptomatic and detected during routine radiographic investigations. Prompt diagnosis and early management of such defects is essential to maintain the integrity of the tooth. Non-surgical and surgical methods are the two main strategies involved in the management of internal resorption. The non-surgical method is usually preferred, but in cases of extensive resorption with external root perforation, surgical intervention has been advocated. The present case illustrates repair of perforating internal resorption by hybrid method, using mineral trioxide aggregate and gutta-percha, following surgical exposure. After a 10-month follow-up, no clinical and radiographic abnormalities were observed. Additionally, there was also marked reduction in periodontal pocket depth.
