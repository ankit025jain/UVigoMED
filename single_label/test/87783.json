{"id":87783,"title":"[Treatment of sleep disorders in patients with mild cranial-brain injury in the early rehabilitation period].","abstract":"To study the effect of melatonin (melaxen) on sleep disorders in patients with mild cranial-brain injury (CBI) in the early rehabilitation period.Sixty patients were randomized to equal groups treated or not treated with melaxen. Along with neurological and somatic examination, polysomnography and scales for measurement depression and quality of life ( ESS, BDI, EuroQol etc) were used.Melatonin improved sleep (sleep latency, number of wakings per night etc) and decreased the severity of depression in the early rehabilitation period after mild CBI. Further research is needed to fully understand the effect of melatonin on sleep disorders in CBI, in particular in its later stages.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988965","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.744201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.704349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.617231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.483217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Sleep onset latency","weight":0.0237607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_onset_latency"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Belief-Desire-Intention software model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief-Desire-Intention_software_model"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
