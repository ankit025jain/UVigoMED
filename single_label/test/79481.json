{"id":79481,"title":"Combined radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction and lateral outfracture of hypertrophic inferior turbinate in the treatment of chronic rhinitis: short-term and long-term outcome.","abstract":"Radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (RFVTR) of hypertrophic inferior turbinate (IT) is an effective way to treat patients with intractable nasal mucosal obstruction. We evaluated the effectiveness of combined RFVTR and lateral outfracture (LO) of hypertrophic IT in chronic rhinitis (CR) patients on reduction of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritus both short and long term.Seventy-three patients with CR who failed medical treatment were recruited to undergo combined RFVTR and LO of hypertrophic IT. Nasal congestion scores were recorded before the operation, and immediately, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after the operation. Rhinorrhea and pruritic score as well as total nasal airway resistance (TNAR) and total nasal airflow (TNAF) (measured by active anterior rhinomanometry) were recorded before the operation, and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after the operation.Forty-five patients completed the follow-up period of 3 years. Subjects consisted of 25 male and 20 female patients, with an average age of 31 years. Nasal congestion scores were significantly improved immediately after the operation. Nasal congestion scores and TNAR values were significantly decreased whereas TNAF values were significantly increased at every time point postoperatively. Rhinorrhea and pruritic scores were also significantly improved at every time point after 2 weeks postoperatively.Combined RFVTR and LO of hypertrophic IT is an effective treatment for nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritus in CR and the result lasts up to 3 years postoperatively.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415652","annotations":[{"name":"Rhinorrhea","weight":0.795066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.787032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Nasal concha","weight":0.776142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_concha"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.757355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.647556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.523583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.436312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.369237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.292466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Airway resistance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_resistance"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
