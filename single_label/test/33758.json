{"id":33758,"title":"Umbilical hernia repair with mesh: identifying effectors of ideal outcomes.","abstract":"Quality of life has become an important focus for improvement in hernia repair.The International Hernia Mesh Registry was queried. The Carolinas Comfort Scale quantitated quality of life at 1-month, 6-month, and annual follow-up. Scores of 0 (completely asymptomatic) in all categories without recurrence defined an ideal outcome.The analysis consisted of 363 umbilical hernia repairs; 18.7% were laparoscopic. Demographics included age of 51.5 ± 13.8 years, 24.5% were female, and the average body mass index was 30.63 ± 5.9 kg/m(2). Mean defect size was 4.3 ± 3.1 cm(2). Mean follow-up was 18.2 months. Absent/minimal preoperative symptoms were predictive of ideal outcome at all time points and increasing age was predictive at 6 months and 1 year. At 6 months, the use of fixation sutures alone versus tacks (odds ratio 14.1) predicted ideal outcome.Ideal outcomes are dependent on both patient-specific and operative factors. The durable, ideal outcome in umbilical hernia repair is most likely in an older, asymptomatic patient who undergoes mesh fixation with permanent suture.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793575","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.766577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.685364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.492811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.414357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.258646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0827627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"The Carolinas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carolinas"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Hernia repair","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia_repair"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"363","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/363"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"The International (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(film)"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Comfort, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort,_Texas"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
