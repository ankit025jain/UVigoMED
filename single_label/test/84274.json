{"id":84274,"title":"Growth and intestinal morphology of juvenile pacu Piaractus mesopotamicus (Holmberg 1887) fed dietary prebiotics (mannanoligosaccharides - MOS).","abstract":"Intensification of aquaculture production systems exposes fish to numerous stressors, which may negatively affect their growth and limit profitability of aquaculture systems. This study determined effects of increasing levels of dietary mannanoligosaccharides on growth and intestine morphology of pacu. Fish (44.04 g) were randomly distributed into 32 tanks (500 L; 10 fishes per tank) and fed during 63 days with a commercial diet supplemented with 0.0; 0.2; 0.4; 0.6; 0.8; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0% dietary mannanoligosaccharides. Growth parameters did not differ (P>0.05) between fish fed control diet and mannanoligosaccharide supplemented diets. Intestinal villi perimeter was performed in fish fed control diet, 0.4 and 1.5% dietary mannanoligosaccharides and also showed no differences (P>0.05) between treatments. Dietary supplementation of mannanoligosaccharides unclear did not have effects on pacu. Studies on the characterization of intestinal microbiota together with experiment that reproduce commercial fish production systems rearing conditions are necessary to determine the effective use of this dietary supplement for the species.
