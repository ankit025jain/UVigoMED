{"id":48044,"title":"[A clinical example of conservative management of a female patient with manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism].","abstract":"The problems of the timely diagnosis and treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) have recently attracted more and more attention because this disease now ranks third in incidence rates among endocrine diseases. Older women form a group at risk for this disease. Surgical removal of the source of parathyroid hormone hypersecretion is the only radical treatment option for this disease, which is performed in the majority of patients with PHPT. Occasionally, surgical treatment is contraindicated or unadvisable. In these cases, the possibilities of long-term medical treatment become relevant. For this, there are several groups of drugs available, such as bisphosphonates to maintain bone tissue, calcium-sensing receptor agonists (calcium mimetics) that are effective in reducing blood calcium levels. The patients frequently require combined therapy to control the major manifestations of the disease. There are limited data on the long-term medical management of patients with manifest PHPT in the literature.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306753","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.755055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.597515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Endocrine disease","weight":0.496535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disease"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.483927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.374441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Primary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
