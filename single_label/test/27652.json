{"id":27652,"title":"The BAG3 gene variants in Polish patients with dilated cardiomyopathy: four novel mutations and a genotype-phenotype correlation.","abstract":"BAG3 gene mutations have been recently implicated as a novel cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of BAG3 mutations in Polish patients with DCM and to search for genotype-phenotype correlations.We studied 90 unrelated probands by direct sequencing of BAG3 exons and splice sites. Large deletions/insertions were screened for by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).We found 5 different mutations in 6 probands and a total of 21 mutations among their relatives: the known p.Glu455Lys mutation (2 families), 4 novel mutations: p.Gln353ArgfsX10 (c.1055delC), p.Gly379AlafsX45 (c.1135delG), p.Tyr451X (c.1353C>A) and a large deletion of 17,990Â bp removing BAG3 exons 3-4. Analysis of mutation positive relatives of the probands from this study pooled with those previously reported showed higher DCM prevalence among those with missense vs. truncating mutations (OR?=?8.33, P?=?0.0058) as well as a difference in age at disease onset between the former and the latter in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P?=?0.006). Clinical data from our study suggested that in BAG3 mutation carriers acute onset DCM with hemodynamic compromise may be triggered by infection.BAG3 point mutations and large deletions are relatively frequent cause of DCM. Delayed DCM onset associated with truncating vs. non-truncating mutations may be important for genetic counseling.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008357","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.819453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.781457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Glutamine","weight":0.739591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine"},{"name":"Glycine","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.697336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.269357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.201923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
