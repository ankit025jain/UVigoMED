{"id":86876,"title":"[Research advances in molecular epidemiology and vaccines of Coxsackievirus A16].","abstract":"Epidemics of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) have mainly been caused by Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and Enterovirus A 71 (EV-A71), which circulated alternatively or together in the affected area. CVA16 has caused numerous outbreaks and epidemics in multiple countries and geographical regions, and has become an important public health problem. Based on an analysis of the complete VP1 coding region, all CVA16 strains can be divided into genotypes A, B1, and B2. Furthermore, genotype B1 can be divided into subgenotypes B1a, B1b, and B1c. After 2000, no reports of genotype B2 virus strains have been reported. All of the CVA16 strains reported in mainland China have belonged to subgenotypes B1a and B1b. Most CVA16-associated infections cause only mild symptoms; however, some CVA16 infections can lead to severe complications and even death. Vaccination is considered to be the most effective method to control the transmission and infection rate of this virus. A number of research groups are studying various vaccine types, including inactivated vaccines, genetic engineering vaccines, and DNA vaccines, amongst others. In this review, an overview is provided of the research advances in molecular epidemiology and vaccines of CVA16.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272607","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.76088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.754053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.751733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Enterovirus","weight":0.431715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterovirus"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.319321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.280056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Hand, foot and mouth disease","weight":0.128079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand,_foot_and_mouth_disease"},{"name":"Coxsackievirus","weight":0.0489124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackievirus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"DNA vaccination","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Coxsackie A virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackie_A_virus"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Molecular epidemiology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_epidemiology"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Extra-vehicular activity","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-vehicular_activity"}]}
