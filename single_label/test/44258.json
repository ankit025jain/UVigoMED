{"id":44258,"title":"[Two cases of curative resection by laparoscopic surgery following preoperative chemotherapy with bevacizumab for locally advanced colon cancer].","abstract":"Here we report 2 cases of curative resection following preoperative chemotherapy with bevacizumab for locally advanced colon cancer. Case 1 was a 62-year-old man admitted with constipation, abdominal distention, and abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomography(CT)scan revealed an obstructive tumor of the sigmoid colon with invasion into the bladder. A diverting colostomy was performed, and chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6(infusional 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin+ oxaliplatin) plus bevacizumab was initiated. The tumor shrunk markedly after 6 courses of this treatment. Thereafter, laparoscopy- assisted sigmoidectomy was successfully performed. Case 2 was a 61-year-old woman admitted with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. An abdominal CT scan revealed an obstructive tumor of the sigmoid colon with invasion into the ileum, uterus and retroperitoneum. A diverting colostomy was performed, and chemotherapy with XELOX(capecitabine+ oxaliplatin)plus bevacizumab was initiated. The tumor shrunk markedly after 6 courses of this treatment. Thereafter, laparoscopy- assisted sigmoidectomy was successfully performed. Both cases demonstrated partial clinical responses to chemotherapy; thus, curative resection surgeries were performed. There were no perioperative complications. Therefore, we conclude that oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and laparoscopic resection could be very effective for locally advanced colon cancer.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743370","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Colostomy","weight":0.822293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.762319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.499803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"}]}
