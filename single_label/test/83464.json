{"id":83464,"title":"Effect of maternal supplementation with seaweed extracts on growth performance and aspects of gastrointestinal health of newly weaned piglets after challenge with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88.","abstract":"In the present study, a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal supplementation with seaweed extracts ( - SWE v. +SWE, n 20) from day 83 of gestation until weaning (day 28) on post-weaning (PW) growth performance, faecal score, faecal enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) toxin quantification, intestinal histology and cytokine mRNA of unchallenged and ETEC-challenged pigs. Pigs were ETEC challenged on day 9 PW. There was a maternal treatment × challenge (SWE × ETEC) interaction effect on growth performance and faecal score (P< 0.05). Pigs from SWE-supplemented sows and ETEC-challenged (SE) had higher average daily gain (ADG) during 0-13 d PW and reduced faecal score during 0-72 h post-challenge than those from basal-fed sows and ETEC-challenged (BE) (P< 0.05). However, there was no difference between unchallenged pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows (SC) and basal-fed sows (BC) (P>0.10). Pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows had reduced heat-labile enterotoxin gene copy numbers than those from the basal-fed sows (P< 0.05). Maternal SWE supplementation increased the villus height in the ileum of pigs (P< 0.05). There was a SWE × ETEC interaction effect (P< 0.05) on IL-6 mRNA and a SWE × gastrointestinal (GI) region interaction effect (P< 0.05) on transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) and TNF-? mRNA. IL-6 mRNA was down-regulated in SC pigs than BC pigs (P< 0.05). However, there was no difference in IL-6 mRNA between SE and BE pigs. The mRNA of TGF-?1 and TNF-? was down-regulated in the colon of pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows compared with those from the basal-fed sows (P< 0.05). However, there was no difference in TGF-?1 and TNF-? mRNA in the ileum between the pigs from the SWE-supplemented sows and basal-fed sows. In conclusion, maternal SWE supplementation improves ADG and the aspects of GI health of weaned pigs following an ETEC challenge.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345748","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.452303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.343268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Seaweed","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.241274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Enterotoxin","weight":0.23543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxin"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxigenic_Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Gene dosage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_dosage"}]}
