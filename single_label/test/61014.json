{"id":61014,"title":"Interleukin-18 produced by bone marrow-derived stromal cells supports T-cell acute leukaemia progression.","abstract":"Development of novel therapies is critical for T-cell acute leukaemia (T-ALL). Here, we investigated the effect of inhibiting the MAPK/MEK/ERK pathway on T-ALL cell growth. Unexpectedly, MEK inhibitors (MEKi) enhanced growth of 70% of human T-ALL cell samples cultured on stromal cells independently of NOTCH activation and maintained their ability to propagate in vivo. Similar results were obtained when T-ALL cells were cultured with ERK1/2-knockdown stromal cells or with conditioned medium from MEKi-treated stromal cells. Microarray analysis identified interleukin 18 (IL-18) as transcriptionally up-regulated in MEKi-treated MS5 cells. Recombinant IL-18 promoted T-ALL growth in vitro, whereas the loss of function of IL-18 receptor in T-ALL blast cells decreased blast proliferation in vitro and in NSG mice. The NFKB pathway that is downstream to IL-18R was activated by IL-18 in blast cells. IL-18 circulating levels were increased in T-ALL-xenografted mice and also in T-ALL patients in comparison with controls. This study uncovers a novel role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 and outlines the microenvironment involvement in human T-ALL development.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778454","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.881188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.77453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.668116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.531806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase","weight":0.114033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Interleukin 18","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_18"},{"name":"Proinflammatory cytokine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proinflammatory_cytokine"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Precursor cell","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_cell"}]}
