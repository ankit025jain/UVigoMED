{"id":66709,"title":"Serum procalcitonin level for prediction of high-grade vesicoureteral reflux in urinary tract infection.","abstract":"Procalcitonin is a reliable and specific marker of bacterial infections such as urinary tract infection. Some authors suggest measurement of serum procalcitonin as a predictor of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). We investigated this association in children admitted because of acute pyelonephritis.Forty-eight children with the first febrile urinary tract infection were included. Twelve patients had low-grade VUR, 9 patients had high-grade VUR, and 27 patients did not have any VUR in their imaging assessment.There was a significant association between high-grade VUR and higher levels of procalcitonin (P = .04). The sensitivity of a procalcitonin level of 0.31 ng/mL or greater was 90% and the specificity was 32% for diagnosis of high-grade VUR.We concluded that serum procalcitonin concentration is a sensitive and promising predictor of high-grade VUR.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685732","annotations":[{"name":"Pyelonephritis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyelonephritis"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.50241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.467787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vesicoureteral reflux","weight":0.359541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicoureteral_reflux"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
