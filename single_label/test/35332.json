{"id":35332,"title":"[Early use of calf pulmonary surfactant in late preterm and full-term infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a randomized controlled trial].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of calf pulmonary surfactant (PS) in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in late preterm and full-term infants.A randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of calf PS intratracheally given at different times and doses in infants with RDS who had a gestational age of ?35 weeks and an oxygenation index (OI) of 10-20. The subjects were randomly assigned to treatment group 1 (n=58), treatment group 2 (n=58), and control group (n=59). Treatment group 1 was given PS (50 mg/kg) within 6 hours after admission. Treatment group 2 was given PS (70 mg/kg) within 6 hours after admission. The control group was not given PS within 6 hours after admission and was given PS (50 mg/kg) over 6 hours after admission if having no remission by conventional therapy including mechanical ventilation. For each group, a second dose of PS (50 mg/kg) was given if no remission was observed within 12 hours after the first administration.There were no significant differences in mortality between the three groups. Treatment group 2 had lower hospitalization expense and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation compared with treatment group 1, and treatment group 1 had lower hospitalization expense and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation compared with the control group. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and length of hospital stay in treatment group 2 was lower than those in treatment group 1 and control group. Compared with the control group, Treatment groups 1 and 2 showed decreases in 2 or more times of PS use, maximum OI, duration of continuous positive airway pressure treatment, and incidence of air leak syndrome and pulmonary hypertension.Early use of sufficient PS in late preterm and full-term infants with RDS can reduce complications, secondary use of PS, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay, and hospitalization expense.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661523","annotations":[{"name":"Surfactant","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.817641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Infant respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.758052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.549967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.526785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Pulmonary surfactant","weight":0.479295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_surfactant"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.343501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.332722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.277087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Calf (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(anatomy)"}]}
