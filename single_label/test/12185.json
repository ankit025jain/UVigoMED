{"id":12185,"title":"Tumor-induced STAT3 signaling in myeloid cells impairs dendritic cell generation by decreasing PKC?II abundance.","abstract":"A major mechanism by which cancers escape control by the immune system is by blocking the differentiation of myeloid cells into dendritic cells (DCs), immunostimulatory cells that activate antitumor T cells. Tumor-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in myeloid progenitor cells is thought to cause this block in their differentiation. In addition, a signaling pathway through protein kinase C ?II (PKC?II) is essential for the differentiation of myeloid cells into DCs. We found in humans and mice that breast cancer cells substantially decreased the abundance of PKC?II in myeloid progenitor cells through a mechanism involving the enhanced activation of STAT3 signaling by soluble, tumor-derived factors (TDFs). STAT3 bound to previously undescribed negative regulatory elements within the promoter of PRKCB, which encodes PKC?II. We also found a previously undescribed counter-regulatory mechanism through which the activity of PKC?II inhibited tumor-dependent STAT3 signaling by decreasing the abundance of cell surface receptors, such as cytokine and growth factor receptors, that are activated by TDFs. Together, these data suggest that a previously unrecognized cross-talk mechanism between the STAT3 and PKC?II signaling pathways provides the molecular basis for the tumor-induced blockade in the differentiation of myeloid cells, and suggest that enhancing PKC?II activity may be a therapeutic strategy to alleviate cancer-mediated suppression of the immune system.
