{"id":79457,"title":"Ototoxicity in children with high-risk neuroblastoma: prevalence, risk factors, and concordance of grading scales--a report from the Children's Oncology Group.","abstract":"Platinum-based therapy is the mainstay for management of high-risk neuroblastoma. Prevalence of platinum-related ototoxicity has ranged from 13% to 95% in previous reports; variability is attributable to small samples and disparate grading scales. There is no consensus regarding optimal ototoxicity grading. Furthermore, prevalence and predictors of hearing loss in a large uniformly treated high-risk neuroblastoma population are unknown. We address these gaps in our study.Audiologic testing was completed after administration of cisplatin alone (< 400 mg/m(2); exposure one) or after cisplatin (400 mg/m(2)) plus carboplatin (1,700 mg/m(2); exposure two). Hearing loss was graded using four scales (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association; Brock; Chang; and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3 [CTCAEv3]).Of 489 eligible patients, 333 had evaluable audiologic data. Median age at diagnosis was 3.3 years. Prevalence of severe hearing loss differed by scale. For those in the exposure-one group, prevalence ranged from 8% per Brock to 47% per CTCAEv3 (Brock v CTCAEv3 and Chang, P < .01; CTCAEv3 v Chang, P = .16); for those in the exposure-two group, prevalence ranged from 30% per Brock to 71% per CTCAEv3 (all pair-wise comparisons, P < .01). In patients requiring hearing aids, hearing loss was graded as severe in 49% (Brock), 91% (Chang), and 100% (CTCAEv3). Risk factors for severe hearing loss included exposure to cisplatin and carboplatin compared with cisplatin alone and hospitalization for infection.Severe hearing loss is prevalent among children with high-risk neuroblastoma. Exposure to cisplatin combined with myeloablative carboplatin significantly increases risk. The Brock scale underestimates severe hearing loss and should be used with caution in this setting.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24419114","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.427691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.302517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Carboplatin","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboplatin"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.146286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.142684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ototoxicity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ototoxicity"},{"name":"Coordinated Incident Management System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Incident_Management_System"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Pairwise comparison","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_comparison"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"}]}
