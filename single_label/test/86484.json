{"id":86484,"title":"[Role of transthoracic biopsy in the modern diagnosis of tumors of organs in the thoracic cavity].","abstract":"This review summarizes data of publications and meta-analyses devoted ton the use of transthoracic biopsy. It is showed that the method continues to be one of the main ways to diagnose pathological processes in the thoracic cavity's organs, especially tumors of the lungs, pleura, mediastinum and chest wall. Modern methods of navigation trepan-needles can receive sufficient volume of pathological tissue samples for subsequent full morphological study to individualize and optimize treatment algorithms.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772610","annotations":[{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.888001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.85059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Ton","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Process (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(anatomy)"}]}
