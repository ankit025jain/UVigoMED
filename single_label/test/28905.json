{"id":28905,"title":"Gender and racial/ethnic differences in patterns of adolescent alcohol use and associations with adolescent and adult illicit drug use.","abstract":"The study objective was to use latent class analyses (LCAs) to identify gender- and racial/ethnic-specific groups of adolescent alcohol users and associations between alcohol use group and adolescent and adulthood illicit drug use in a nationally-representative US sample.We used Wave I (1994-1995, adolescence) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to conduct LCAs by gender and race/ethnicity and measure associations between class membership and Wave I and Wave III (2001-2002, young adulthood) drug use. Participants included white (n=9548), African American (n=4005) and Hispanic (n=3184) participants. LCAs were based on quantity and frequency of adolescent alcohol use; physiological and social consequences of use; and peer use.Males and females were characterized by different alcohol use typologies and consequences. Males in the highest severity class (i.e. drank both heavily and frequently) experienced disproportionate risk of alcohol-related consequences compared with abstainers and other alcohol-using groups. Females who drank heavily when drinking even if only occasionally, experienced high risk of alcohol-related consequences. Substantial proportions of males reported diverse alcohol-related problems, whereas females most commonly reported alcohol-related problems with dating and sexual experiences. Though levels of alcohol use and report of problems associated with use were higher among white versus minority populations, other racial/ethnic differences in patterns of alcohol use were minimal. Classification in any drinking class was a strong risk factor for adolescent and adulthood illicit drug use, with heavy drinkers at greatest risk of drug use.Gender-specific adolescent alcohol and substance use prevention programs are warranted.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766088","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.615836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.358743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.346474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.334169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.316595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.25785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.146946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Young adult (psychology)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_(psychology)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Longitudinal_Study_of_Adolescent_Health"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Alcohol by volume","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Youth health","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_health"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
