{"id":91017,"title":"Parents' traumatic brain injury increases their children's risk for use of psychiatric care: the 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort study.","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) of a parent causes significant changes in their family life and parent-children relationships. However, the number of children affected by parental TBI and the long-term consequences for these children remain unknown. We estimated the prevalence of children affected by parental TBI and investigated whether these children had greater use of psychiatric services than their peers.This a retrospective population-based register study. All 60,069 children born in Finland in 1987 were followed up through national health and social registers from 1987 to 2008.During the 21-year follow-up, 1532 (2.6%) children had a parent with TBI. Overall, 22.5% of those having a parent with TBI were treated in specialized psychiatric care. Use of psychiatric care was significantly increased among those cohort members with a parent with mild [odds ratio (OR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.38] or severe (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12-1.98) TBI compared to their peers.Parental TBI is associated with increased use of specialized psychiatric services by children. Adult health care services must have appropriate systems in place to address the psychosocial needs and support the welfare and development of children of patients with TBI.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556261","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.808054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.722133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.711481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.62031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.432482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.411422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.40749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.298179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Welfare","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"1532","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1532"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Processor register","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Peers","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peers"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
