{"id":70469,"title":"[Expressions of FOXC1 and MMP-7 in molecular subtypes of breast cancer and their association with clinicopathological characteristics].","abstract":"To investigate the expressions of FOXC1 and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer and their association with clinicopathological characteristics of the disease.Based on immunohistochemical results of ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, CK14 and EGFR, 105 breast cancer patients were classified as 4 subtypes: luminal, HER2 positive, basal-like subtype (BLs) and normal breast-like subtype (NBLs). The association of FOXC1 and MMP-7 expressions with clinicopathological parameters in different molecular subtypes was analyzed.Out of 105 patients with breast cancer, the subtypes of luminal, HER2 positive, BLs and NBLs accounted for 52.4% (55/105), 16.2% (17/105), 17.1%(18/105) and 14.3% (15/105), respectively. Patients with luminal and/or NBLs subtypes had significantly higher 5-year survival rate than those with HER2 positive and/or BLs did (log-rank=22.161, P<0.01). The overall positive expression rate of FOXC1 was 26.7% (28/105) and the expression was higher in BLs patients than that in other subgroups (?²=30.108, P<0.01). The expression of FOXC1 was correlated with histological grade, tumor size, distant metastasis and 5-year survival rate of breast cancer. The overall positive expression rate of MMP-7 was 67.6% (71/105) and the expression of MMP-7 was also higher in BLs patients than that in other molecular subtypes (?²=11.328, P<0.05). The positive expression of MMP-7 was correlated with metastasis in ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, distant metastasis and 5-year survival rate of the patients. FOXC1 was correlated with MMP-7 (r=0.325, P<0.01).Patients with luminal and/or NBLs breast cancer have more favorable prognosis than those with HER2 positive and/or BLs subtypes. The expressions of FOXC1 and MMP-7 are closely correlated with the clinicopathological features of breast cancer patients.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187454","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.901771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.77365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.533002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.288619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.170117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.165723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.0226131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
