{"id":15364,"title":"To choose the proper antibiotic regimen between the old and new antimicrobial agents and to determine the optimum dosage with Bi-Digital O-Ring Test.","abstract":"Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT) can be used for various purposes for medical and dental diagnosis as well as for treatment purposes by determining the type of medication and the dosage for a patient. In case of infection, BDORT is a fast and non-invasive way to decide what kind of antibiotic and the dosage to be given to patient. If a patient already has been on a certain antibiotic for days, the clinician could use BDORT with diode (with arrow signs of the diode pointing to the patient) to test the same drug. Otherwise without diode, if BDORT result is negative, it could either mean the negative result might be due to resonance phenomenon or it may be because the antibiotic is ineffective. Either way, if O-Ring would be open during testing, the clinician should gradually increase or decrease the dosage of antibiotic to find out if BDORT result begins to become positive. In great majority of cases involving less effective old generation antibiotics, it is usually due to resistant microbia that require increasing dosage of antibiotic to make it become more effective. If increasing dosage would make O-Ring close, then the increased dosage would be effective to the patient. If the result is negative, the clinician should consider switching to another antibiotic regimen that may be tested positive with BDORT. Old generation antibiotics have not necessarily lost usefulness or lack efficacy on those new emerging resistant bacteria. Clinicians may just need to increase the dosage of those older generation antibiotics to make them more effective. In fact, with so many antibiotic-resisting strains of bacteria, clinician often face dilemma whether to switch to newer generation of antibiotics or just to increase the dosage of the older generation of antibiotics that a patient has been taking. When testing antibiotic of penicillin-related medication including amoxicillin, the thymus tablet (bovine source) should also be used for the testing after initially testing without it. Such a double checking system will avoid the false signal from BDORT about the drugs of penicillin family.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219031","annotations":[{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.892155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.794775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.740967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.492441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.483834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.322908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.159878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.103779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Arrow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow"},{"name":"Electric generator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"}]}
