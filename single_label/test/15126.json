{"id":15126,"title":"The application of MALDI-TOF MS for dermatophyte identification.","abstract":"Dermatophytes are keratinolytic fungi responsible for a wide variety of diseases of the skin, nails and hair of mammals. Their identification is often complicated, labor-intensive and time consuming due to the high degree of intra-species morphological similarity, and also requires scientific knowledge and practice. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS technique may be a faster and more sophisticated method useful for the identification of dermatophytes and mycoses in general.","date":"2014-10-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281811","annotations":[{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.875066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.563645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Dermatophyte","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatophyte"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.106292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Master of Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science"}]}
