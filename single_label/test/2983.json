{"id":2983,"title":"[Location of the placenta in pregnancy with previous caesarean section].","abstract":"Previous Caesarean section (SC) is considered to be established predisposing factor for abnormal placentation. In this study we examined whether prior SC is a risk factor for low laying placenta. Retrospective documentation was studied of 171 pregnant women after a SC (test group) and of 150 pregnant women after a normal birth (control), and cases of hysterectomy after giving birth to five years. Pathological lying placenta have established at 1.34% in the test group versus 0.67% in controls (p - 0.058), i.e. no proven link between prior Cesarean section and location of the placenta in the lower uterine segment during the next pregnancy. The analysis of cases of postpartum hysterectomy is found that the combination of condition after Cesarean section, placenta praevia and placenta accreta is a risk factor for hysterectomy after childbirth.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510049","annotations":[{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.868238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Placenta accreta","weight":0.836387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta_accreta"},{"name":"Placenta praevia","weight":0.829934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta_praevia"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.50878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.384521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.237942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pseudologia fantastica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudologia_fantastica"},{"name":"Placentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placentation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"South Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
