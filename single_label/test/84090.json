{"id":84090,"title":"[Etiological study on cases with viral diarrhea in Ningxia during 2011].","abstract":"To investigate the etiological characteristics of human rotavirus (HRV), human calicivirus (HuCV), human astrovirus (HAstV) and human enteral adenovirus (HAdV) in Ningxia province during 2011.Stool specimen was collected from acute diarrhea case of Ningxia during 2011. HRV was detected by ELISA and serotype/genotype identified on those RT-PCR positive specimens. HuCV, HAstV and HAdV were detected by RT-PCR.In this study, a total of 690 specimens were detected, with the infection rates of HRV, HuCV, HAstV and HAdV as 2.17%, 21.74%, 3.19% and 6.52%, respectively. Co-infections were found in 4.20% of all the samples being tested. Among 15 HRV positive cases, serotypes G1, G3 and P[4] were the most predominant strains.Children who were under 2 years of age were the majority among patients infected by diarrhea viruses while HuCV was recognized as the main pathogen responsible for the viral diarrhea cases in Ningxia, 2011.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174482","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Astrovirus","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrovirus"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Caliciviridae","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliciviridae"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.426429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.314095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.160454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Ningxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
