{"id":44337,"title":"Anti-fibrosis effects of Huisheng oral solution in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rat.","abstract":"Some gradient of Huisheng oral solution (HOS) has been reported to have anti-fibrosis activity. This study was designed to investigate whether HOS could inhibit liver fibrosis and to elucidate its molecular mechanism of action.Hepatic fibrosis model in rat was induced by subcutaneous injection of CCl4. Rats in the treatment group were administrated with HOS intragastrically. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and Masson's trichrome staining were used to examine the changes in liver pathology. Levels of ALT, AST, LDH, hyaluronic acid (HA) and laminin (LN) in serum and hydroxyproline (Hyp) in liver were detected by biochemical examination and radioimmunoassay, respectively. The expression and distribution of Smad3, TGF-?1, ?-SMA and TIMP-1 were observed and the active TGF-?1 was tested.Our data demonstrated that HOS alleviated CCl4-induced collagen deposition in liver tissue, improved liver condition and liver function in rats. HOS also significantly reduced the expression and distribution of Smad3, TGF-?1, ?-SMA and TIMP-1 as well as decreased active TGF-?1.This study revealed that HOS attenuates the development of liver fibrosis through suppressing the TGF-?1 pathway. It provides us a new approach to treatment of liver fibrosis.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741197","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.677403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hydroxyproline","weight":0.656654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyproline"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.646638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.645925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.575048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radioimmunoassay","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioimmunoassay"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.314635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.298884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.140815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Eosin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin"},{"name":"Laminin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Masson's trichrome stain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masson's_trichrome_stain"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
