{"id":92162,"title":"Asymptomatic Chronic Epidural Hematoma in a Child As a Result ofÂ Extracranial Decompression.","abstract":"Epidural hematoma (EDH) in children is a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific clinical presentation. Asymptomatic chronic epidural hematoma is a very rare entity. Reports of spontaneous decompression into the subgaleal spaces are limited with acute epidural hematomas in the literature.We report a child presenting with chronic epidural hematoma at 15 days after a head trauma. She remained asymptomatic, owing to spontaneous decompression via a skull fracture. We intend to remind emergency physicians to be alert about epidural hematomas in asymptomatic children in the presence of a history of, even minor and distant, trauma.An 8-year-old girl presented to the Emergency Department with a swelling in the right parietal region. She had fallen at the playground and struck her head on the ground 15 days prior. Computed tomography showed a mixed-density subacute-chronic parietal epidural hematoma with a linear fracture overlying it. There was no evidence of midline shift or ipsilateral ventricular compression.An initially minimal but expanding EDH in a child can remain asymptomatic even in the later phases, owing to the spontaneous decompression through a skull fracture.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440624","annotations":[{"name":"Epidural hematoma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural_hematoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Skull fracture","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.603988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.482396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Parietal lobe","weight":0.460781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.349949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.151124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
