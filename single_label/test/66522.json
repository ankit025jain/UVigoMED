{"id":66522,"title":"Genome-wide screening and identification of long noncoding RNAs and their interaction with protein coding RNAs in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma.","abstract":"To understand lncRNAs expression profiling and their potential functions in bladder cancer, we investigated the lncRNA and coding RNA expression on human bladder cancer and normal bladder tissues. Bioinformatic analysis revealed thousands of significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs and coding mRNA in bladder cancer relative to normal bladder tissue. Co-expression analysis revealed that 50% of lncRNAs and coding RNAs expressed in the same direction. A subset of lncRNAs might be involved in mTOR signaling, p53 signaling, cancer pathways. Our study provides a large scale of co-expression between lncRNA and coding RNAs in bladder cancer cells and lays biological basis for further investigation.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705305","annotations":[{"name":"P53","weight":0.862818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.719464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.678324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.611753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.521569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.153015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Biological psychiatry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_psychiatry"},{"name":"Hydraulic head","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_head"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
