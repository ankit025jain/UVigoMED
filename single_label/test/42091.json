{"id":42091,"title":"Beger and Frey procedures for treatment of chronic pancreatitis: comparison of outcomes at 16-year follow-up.","abstract":"Chronic pancreatitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by progressive fibrosis of pancreatic tissue. The principal symptom is chronic pain resulting in reduced quality of life and inability to work. Short-term follow-up has shown that duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resections (DPPHRs) are superior in outcomes to pancreaticoduodenectomy. Therefore, these organ-sparing procedures have gained wide acceptance. This trial was conducted to compare patient outcomes 16 years after treatment for chronic pancreatitis by means of the Beger or the Frey procedure.Seventy-four patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups (Beger n = 38) and Frey (n = 36). The perioperative courses in the randomized controlled trial and the 8-year follow-up have been reported previously. All participating patients were contacted with a standardized, validated questionnaire to evaluate long-term survival, quality of life, pain, and exocrine and endocrine function.No significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of quality of life, pain control, or other somatic parameters were detected after a median of 16 years postoperatively. Mortality was comparable after Beger and Frey procedures at 39% vs 34%, respectively, with postoperative survivals of 13.0 ± 1.1 years and 13.3 ± 0.9 years, respectively (p = 0.660). No statistically significant differences were found in rates of endocrine insufficiency (Beger 87% vs Frey 86%; p = 0.953) or exocrine insufficiency (Beger 77% vs Frey 83%; p = 0.655).Duodenum-preserving resections of the pancreatic head offered good and permanent pain relief and substantially increased quality of life in chronic pancreatitis. Overall, a 16-year long-term follow-up found comparable outcomes for the Beger and Frey procedures.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880955","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.791547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.76877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.666424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.374485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Exocrine gland","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"}]}
