{"id":86804,"title":"[ALK fusion gene assessment by fully automatic immunohistochemistry in non-small cell lung cancer].","abstract":"To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of fully automated immunohistochemistry (IHC), with comparison to FISH, in the detection of EML4-ALK rearrangement in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC); and the use of IHC as a pre-screening tool.A total of 404 paraffin-embedded NSCLC samples from surgical resections were tested by IHC with Ventana anti-ALK rabbit monoclonal antibody (D5F3) and ultrasensitive detection kit. ALK rearrangement was further confirmed by FISH.Twenty-nine of 404 lung ADCs (7.2%) were positive for ALK by IHC. ALK positive tumor cells demonstrated strong and diffused granular cytoplasmic staining. All the ALK IHC-positive cases were confirmed to harbor ALK rearrangement by FISH. None of the ALK IHC-negative cases was FISH-positive.IHC can effectively detect ALK rearrangement in lung cancer. It may provide a reliable and cost-effective diagnostic approach in routine pathologic laboratories for the identification of suitable candidates for ALK-targeted therapy.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742568","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.554152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.408618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.368758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.249784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Harbor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Granularity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"}]}
