{"id":31045,"title":"Evaluation of WIN 55,212-2 self-administration in rats as a potential cannabinoid abuse liability model.","abstract":"Because ?(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been a false negative in rat intravenous self-administration procedures, the evaluation of the abuse potential of candidate cannabinoid medications has proved difficult. One lab group has successfully trained self-administration of the aminoalkylindole WIN55,212-2 in rats; however, their results have not been independently replicated. The purpose of this study was to extend their model by using a within-subjects design, with the goal of establishing a robust method suitable for substitution testing of other cannabinoids. Male Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer WIN55,212-2 (0.01 mg/kg/infusion) on a fixed ratio 3 schedule. Dose-effect curves for WIN55,212-2 were determined, followed by vehicle substitution and a dose-effect curve with THC. WIN55,212-2 self-administration was acquired; however, substitution with THC did not maintain responding above vehicle levels. Dose-dependent attenuation by rimonabant confirmed CB1 receptor mediation of WIN55,212-2's reinforcing effects. Vehicle substitution resulted in a session-dependent decrease in responding (i.e., extinction). While this study provides systematic replication of previous studies, lack of substitution with THC is problematic and suggests that WIN55,212-2 self-administration may be of limited usefulness as a screening tool for detection of the reinforcing effects of potential cannabinoid medications. Clarification of underlying factors responsible for failure of THC to maintain self-administration in cannabinoid-trained rats is needed.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412835","annotations":[{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Tetrahydrocannabinol","weight":0.620181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.594855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.593473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.550608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rimonabant","weight":0.507951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimonabant"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.342731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.190571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Order of the Bath","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Extinction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction"},{"name":"Cannabinoid receptor type 1","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1"},{"name":"Cannabinoid receptor","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"2120s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2120s"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"WIN Television","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIN_Television"},{"name":"Legal liability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
