{"id":45383,"title":"(18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging of malignant hepatic solitary fibrous tumor.","abstract":"Solitary fibrous tumor of the liver was rarely documented. F-FDG PET/CT imaging of malignant hepatic solitary fibrous tumor in a 49-year-old male patient was reported. The multifocal hepatic lesions demonstrated avid FDG uptake. FDG PET/CT might be potentially useful in the differentiation of benign and malignant solitary fibrous tumor.
