{"id":18826,"title":"Infectious diseases prioritisation for event-based surveillance at the European Union level for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.","abstract":"In 2012, London hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Games (the Games), with events occurring throughout the United Kingdom (UK) between 27 July and 9 September 2012. Public health surveillance was performed by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Collaboration between the HPA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was established for the detection and assessment of significant infectious disease events (SIDEs) occurring outside the UK during the time of the Games. Additionally, ECDC undertook an internal prioritisation exercise to facilitate ECDCâ€™s decisions on which SIDEs should have preferentially enhanced monitoring through epidemic intelligence activities for detection and reporting in daily surveillance in the European Union (EU). A team of ECDC experts evaluated potential public health risks to the Games, selecting and prioritising SIDEs for event-based surveillance with regard to their potential for importation to the Games, occurrence during the Games or export to the EU/European Economic Area from the Games. The team opted for a multilevel approach including comprehensive disease selection, development and use of a qualitative matrix scoring system and a Delphi method for disease prioritisation. The experts selected 71 infectious diseases to enter the prioritisation exercise of which 27 were considered as priority for epidemic intelligence activities by ECDC for the EU for the Games.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762663","annotations":[{"name":"European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","weight":0.92833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.777392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"London","weight":0.741097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.66604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health Protection Agency","weight":0.627416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Protection_Agency"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.40808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.407594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Olympic Games","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games"},{"name":"Clinical surveillance","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_surveillance"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Delphi","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi"},{"name":"Import","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Export","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.127354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Delphi method","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Paralympic Games","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Control engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering"},{"name":"September 9","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_9"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Smoke detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"Union (American Civil War)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)"},{"name":"Intelligence assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_assessment"},{"name":"Government of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"}]}
