{"id":52567,"title":"[Correlation between adipocytokines levels and metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"To study the correlation between adipocytokines levels and metabolic syndrome (MS) in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Sixty-eight patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, including 51 cases with MS and 17 without MS, were examined for blood pressure (BP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), insulin resistance index (IRI), waist to hip ratio (W/H), body mass index (BMI), and serum adipocytokine levels (IL-6, vaspin, and adiponectin).The diabetic patients with MS had higher BMI, HbA1c, FBG, FINS, IRI, TG, TC, and SBP than those without MS. Serum IL-6 level was higher but adiponectin level was lower in patients with MS than in those without MS. There was no significant difference in vaspin level between the two groups. Adiponectin level was positively correlated with TG (r=-0.30, P=0.02) and inversely with BMI (r=-0.47, P=0.39) and HOMA-IR (r=-0.30, P=0.03); vaspin level was positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r=0.347, P=0.02) and inversely with HDL-L (r=-0.45, P=0.01); IL-6 level was positively correlated with LDL-L (r=0.18, P=0.25) and inversely with HDL-L (r=-0.45, P=0.01).Adiponectin and IL-6 levels are closely related to MS, but the relationship between vaspin and MS needs further investigation.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589612","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Waist-hip ratio","weight":0.65398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist-hip_ratio"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.376497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.369771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.291803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.253147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"}]}
