{"id":86211,"title":"Predictive value of the international association for the study of lung cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification of lung adenocarcinoma in tumor recurrence and patient survival.","abstract":"This study investigated the pattern of recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma and the predictive value of histologic classification in resected lung adenocarcinoma using the new International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) classification system.Histologic classification of 573 patients undergoing resection for lung adenocarcinoma was determined according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification system, and the percentage of each histologic component (lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, and solid) was recorded. The pattern of recurrence of those components and their predictive value were investigated.The predominant histologic pattern was significantly associated with sex (P < .01), invasive tumor size (P < .01), T status (P < .01), N status (P < .01), TNM stage (P < .01), and visceral pleural invasion (P < .01). The percentage of recurrence was significantly higher in micropapillary- and solid-predominant adenocarcinomas (P < .01). Micropapillary- and solid-predominant adenocarcinomas had a significantly higher possibility of developing initial extrathoracic-only recurrence than other types (P < .01). The predominant pattern group (micropapillary or solid v lepidic, acinar, or papillary) was a significant prognostic factor in overall survival (OS; P < .01), probability of freedom from recurrence (P < .01), and disease-specific survival (P < .01) in multivariable analysis. For patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, solid-predominant adenocarcinoma was a significant predictor for poor OS (P = .04).In lung adenocarcinoma, the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification system has significant prognostic and predictive value regarding death and recurrence. Solid-predominant adenocarcinoma was also a significant predictor in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Prognostic and predictive information is important for stratifying patients for aggressive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799473","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.46282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.412859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.370523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.314018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.266733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.150192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Acinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinus"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Stratified medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_medicine"}]}
