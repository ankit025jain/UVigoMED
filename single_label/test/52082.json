{"id":52082,"title":"Risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in patients undergoing assisted reproductive techniques.","abstract":"To compare the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) between pregnancies conceived spontaneously and pregnancies conceived following assisted reproductive technology (ART).This cross-sectional study evaluated the medical records of 215 women who conceived spontaneously and 145 women who conceived following ART from September 2011 to October 2012. Exclusion criteria were: polycystic ovary syndrome, maternal age ?40 years, family history of diabetes in first-degree relatives, pre-pregnancy diabetes, glucose intolerance treated with hypoglycaemic agent (e.g. metformin), history of GDM, history of stillbirth, recurrent miscarriage, history of baby with birth weight ?4kg (macrosomia), parity >3, Cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and hypothyroidism. For better comparison of the incidence of GDM, the ART group was further subdivided into: (i) an in-vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) group (n=95); and (ii) an intrauterine insemination (IUI) group (n=50). The diagnosis of GDM was based on the criteria of the American Diabetes Association.The incidence of GDM was significantly higher in the IVF/ICSI and IUI groups (43% and 26%, respectively) compared with the spontaneous pregnancy group (10%). Age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weight gain in pregnancy were similar among women with GDM in all three groups. In addition, the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was significantly higher in the IVF/ICSI group (21%) compared with the spontaneous pregnancy group (7%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated four strong risk factors for GDM: age, BMI, mode of ART and progesterone use during pregnancy.This study indicated that the risk of GDM is two-fold higher in women with singleton pregnancies conceived following ART compared with women who conceived spontaneously. In addition, progesterone use during pregnancy was found to be an important risk factor for GDM. This subject requires further study.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630294","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass
