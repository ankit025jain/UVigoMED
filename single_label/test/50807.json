{"id":50807,"title":"Novel genetic targets in endometrial cancer.","abstract":"Worldwide, ? 74,000 women die from endometrial cancer each year. Understanding the somatic genomic alterations that drive endometrial tumorigenesis may provide new opportunities to identify targeted therapies for specific subsets of patients. Since 2012, the use of next-generation sequencing to decode the mutational landscape of endometrial tumors has not only confirmed prior knowledge of established genetic targets for serous and endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (ECs), but has also uncovered novel significantly mutated genes, referred to herein as novel genetic targets, which represent candidate cancer genes in these tumors. This editorial summarizes the novel genetic targets that have been identified in serous and endometrioid ECs, according to their unifying functional characteristics. An expert opinion section comments on remaining knowledge gaps that will undoubtedly be filled in future genomic studies of endometrial cancer.
