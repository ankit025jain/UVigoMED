{"id":66948,"title":"Diagnosis of urothelial tumors with a dedicated dual-source dual-energy MDCT protocol: preliminary results.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a dedicated dual-source dual-energy MDCT (DECT) protocol for the detection of urothelial tumors.A DECT protocol including furosemide and split-bolus contrast injection was used in 69 consecutive patients with suspected abnormalities of the urinary system. Thirteen patients were excluded because there was no follow-up available. In 56 patients, the final diagnosis was proven with endoscopy, biopsy, or follow-up and included urothelial tumors (n = 37) in 16 patients, other urinary tract pathologies (n = 9) in eight patients, and absence of lesions of the collecting system in 32 patients. The image series consisted of a dual-energy true unenhanced series, 35-second arterial phase, and 8-minute nephrographic-excretory phase and were analyzed retrospectively. True enhancement of all detected lesions was measured. On the basis of the DECT data of the contrast-enhanced images, virtual unenhanced series were created and iodine concentration was calculated using commercially available software. The attenuation difference between virtual unenhanced and contrast-enhanced images (virtual enhancement) was measured. CT findings were compared with the final diagnosis.Urothelial tumors were identified on 35-second series, 8-minute series, and both series combined, with sensitivity of 91.9% (95% CI, 78.1-98.2%), 83.4% (68.0-93.8%), and 97.3% (85.8-100%), respectively. Urothelial tumors showed stronger virtual enhancement (p = 0.02) and higher iodine concentration (p = 0.03) than lesions of other origin. Distinction between urothelial tumors and nontumoral lesions was possible with sensitivity of 91.9% (78.1-98.2%) when using a threshold concentration of at least 1.0 mg I/mL.Dual phase DECT with virtual unenhanced imaging and iodine concentration measurement appears to be a useful diagnostic test for urothelial tumors.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660734","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.851675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.774672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.681004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.62497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Furosemide","weight":0.622669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furosemide"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.313413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.246841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Enhanced_Cordless_Telecommunications"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 8100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8100"}]}
