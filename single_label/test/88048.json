{"id":88048,"title":"[A retrospective analysis of 5 cases of major burns treated by goat acellular dermal matrix combined with hyaluronic acid].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the goat acellular dermal matrix combined with hyaluronic acid (h-GADM) in the treatment of major burns.A retrospective analysis of 5 patients with major burns undergoing combines microskin and h-GADM grafting. All patients were male, aged 33 to 50 years, and mean burn area were 83% ± 11%, which III degree wounds 60% to 90%. After extensive burns patients admitted to hospital in accordance with conventional treatment processes included fluid resuscitation, airway management, wound management, infection control and other treatment. The patients received the surgery after the shock of spending and hemodynamically stable. Summarized the feasibility and operative techniques of the new method, and elaborated on details by a typical case as an example.All the 5 patients were survival, go through the shock period smoothly, not haven any serious complications as lung infection, wound sepsis, septicemia and kidney failure occurred. A total of nine mircoskin graft operations were undergoing and covered 17 limbs. The average time of the h-GADM desquamtion was (17.7 ± 2.7) days after operation, the hospitalization time was (115 ± 27) days. After (72 ± 6) days, the residual wound was less than 5% total body surface area.The h-GAMD can be a good alternative to cadaver skin in the treatment of major burns.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and
