{"id":56609,"title":"Digital quantification of Goldmann visual fields (GVFs) as a means for genotype-phenotype comparisons and detection of progression in retinal degenerations.","abstract":"To develop a reliable and efficient digital method to quantify planimetric Goldmann visual field (GVF) data to monitor disease course and treatment responses in retinal degenerative diseases.A novel method to digitally quantify GVFs using Adobe Photoshop CS3 was developed for comparison to traditional digital planimetry (Placom 45C digital planimeter; Engineer Supply, Lynchburg, Virginia, USA). GVFs from 20 eyes from 10 patients with Stargardt disease were quantified to assess the difference between the two methods (a total of 230 measurements per method). This quantification approach was also applied to 13 patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) with mutations in RPGR.Overall, measurements using Adobe Photoshop were more rapidly performed than those using conventional planimetry. Photoshop measurements also exhibited less inter- and intraobserver variability. GVF areas for the I4e isopter in patients with the same mutation in RPGR who were nearby in age had similar qualitative and quantitative areas.Quantification of GVFs using Adobe Photoshop is quicker, more reliable, and less user dependent than conventional digital planimetry. It will be a useful tool for both retrospective and prospective studies of disease course as well as for monitoring treatment response in clinical trials for retinal degenerative diseases.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664690","annotations":[{"name":"Retinitis
