{"id":2415,"title":"[Response rules of pressing pain on back section in Governor Vessel in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease].","abstract":"The response rules of pressing pain on the back section in the Governor Vessel in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) were studied to provide references for the diagnosis and treatment of GERD. Seventy-six cases of GERD were included into an observation group while 30 healthy volunteers were recruited into a control group. A mechanical measurement device of pressing pain that could measure the pain threshold was adapted to observe the pressing pain on the back section in the Governor Vessel in GERD patients and healthy volunteers. The test area is from spinous process of the 1st thoracic vertebra to that of the 12th thoracic vertebra (T1 -T12), including acupoints and non-acupoints on the Governor Vessel. As a result, in the observation group the pain threshold of T5-T7 spinous process clearance, which was the location of Shendao (GV 11), Lingtai (GV 10) and Zhiyang (GV 9), was lower than that in the control group (all P < 0.05). This result indicated that there was significant pressing pain in T5-T7 spinous process clearance in patients with GERD, which could be taken as an important auxiliary diagnosis and a new thinking method in the treatment of GERD with acupuncture.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335255","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.595972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.404468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.332874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.111981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Threshold of pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain"},{"name":"Spinous process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinous_process"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"5T (gang)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5T_(gang)"},{"name":"Measuring instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Glasnost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
