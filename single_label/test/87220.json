{"id":87220,"title":"[Treatment of type C3 distal radius fractures with AO 2.4 mm locking plate system after manipulative reduction].","abstract":"To summarize our experiences in the treatment of type C3 (AO/OTA) distal radius fractures fixed with AO 2.4 mm locking plates combined with percutaneous pinning after manipulative reduction.From May 2009 to March 2012, 19 patients (2 cases of both sides) with type C3 (AO/OTA) distal radius fractures were treated with volar locking plates combined with percutaneous pinning for distal radius after manipulative reduction. Among the patients, the average age was (45.3 ± 17.4) years old (ranged, 31 to 66 years old). The fracture were complicated with ulnar styloid fracture in 14 wrists and 6 wrists had distal radioulnar joint instability. All the patients had closed fracture and the mean duration was (6.7 ± 3.5) days (4.5 to 9 days). The Henry approach was applied to expose the fracture site. Joint capsule and ligaments were retained for indirect reduction. After indirect reduction, the poking reduction technique was used to correct the residual compression, and congruence of distal ulnar radial joint was verified under fluorscopic guidance. Styloid process was first pinned percutaneously and then AO 2.4 mm volar locking plate was used to support rigid fixation. The fractures complicated with distal radioulnar joint instability and ulnar styloid fracture were treated with forearm plaster support in supination for 6 weeks.Nineteen patients (21 wrists) were followed up for an average duration of 10.5 months (ranged, 7 to 17 months). Radiographic bone union of distal radius was achieved in all cases, nonunion of the ulnar styloid occurred in 3 cases, and no distal radioulnar joint instability occurred. Tendon irritation was found in 2 cases and disappeared after the internal fixation was removed. The volar tilt, radial angle, radial length, incongruence of articular surface and distal radioulnar joint were observed at the follow-up. According to Batra and Gupta scoring system, 13 wrists were assessed to have a score of more than 80, 5 wrists 70 to 90, 3 wrists less than 70. Meanwhile, the subjective and objective evaluation was executed,range of motion of wrist, residual deformity and complications were observed. According to Sarmiento's modification of the system of Gartland and Werley, 17 wrists got an excellent result, 3 good and 1 fair.Type C3 (AO/OTA) distal radius fractures could be managed with manipulative reduction. Locking plate internal fixation combined with percutaneous pinning can offer enough support for early mobilization and rehabilitation, resulting in a better clinical outcome and satisfactory prognosis.","date":"2015-01-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577925","annotations":[{"name":"Distal radioulnar
