{"id":17776,"title":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in Sanprasitthiprasong Hospital.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus is a species of bacteria that causes a number of diseases and more than 60% of it is presently resistant to methicillin. Vancomycin is the drug of choice for the eradication of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).This study aimed to investigate the susceptibility of heterogeneous vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) and vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) to vancomycin by standard disk diffusion, microbroth dilution, a one-point population assay, and a population analysis profile.Sixty-eight MRSA isolates from patients admitted to Sanprasitthiprasong Hospital between November 2010 and November 2011 were tested.Standard disk diffusion showed that all the MRSA isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin MICs for all isolates were 1-2 microg/mL. Only two MRSA isolates (2.9%) were able to grow on brain heart infusion agar supplemented with vancomycin 4 microg/mL and were confirmed by a population analysis as hVISA.This study showed the effect of vancomycin on MRSA and the need for early detection and controlled planning.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851558","annotations":[{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.930425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.765546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.564018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.343787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Visa Inc.","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc."},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Magnetic susceptibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"}]}
