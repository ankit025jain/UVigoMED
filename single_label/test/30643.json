{"id":30643,"title":"[Clinical evaluation of multi-function \"rapid\" allergic skin test instrument for application in drug allergy testing].","abstract":"To evaluate the multi-function rapid allergic skin test instrument for application in drug allergy testing.Three hundred patients were planned to be treated with cephalosporins Injection were divided randomly into 3 groups, the new allergic skin test instrument group, normal allergic skin test instrument group, and traditional skin test group, the true positive rate and false positive rate were calculated. Using multifunctional rapid allergy skin test was carried out on 210 cases of volunteers preliminary clinical evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine injections skin test.There were no significance difference between the new allergic skin test instrument group and control group in the true positive rate. As compared with the control group, a significance difference was found between the new allergic skin test instrument group and control group in false positive rate respectively (P < 0.05).The multi-function rapid allergic skin test instrument is safe and easy to use, with a higher rate of accuracy and lower false positive rate.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471325","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.784812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.754841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.5807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.545358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.388373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.295421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"China","weight":0.246599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Drug allergy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_allergy"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Multifunction printer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
