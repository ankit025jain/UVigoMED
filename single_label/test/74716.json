{"id":74716,"title":"Reflections: Neurology and The Humanities. The case of the locked house. The finished mystery.","abstract":"After the death in 2012 of Dr. Robert Joynt, who served NeurologyÂ® as CPC Section Editor, an unfinished manuscript was found on his computer. It would have been his sixth Sherlock Holmes pastiche. Intrigued by the story but deflated at the lack of an ending, the editors published the case in the September 10, 2013, issue of Neurology and requested that readers finish it. A panel of editors reviewed over 30 submissions and the top 4 were posted online and on the iPad. Readers voted online, on the iPad, and during the 2014 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in Philadelphia. The winning coauthors are Peter A. Kempster, from Melbourne, and Andrew J. Lees, from London. The runners-up are Anonymous (ending 1), Gerald Honch (ending 2), and Clifton Gooch (ending 4). The editors thank all participants and voters. The rule on page 662 indicates where the winning ending begins.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25254262","annotations":[{"name":"London","weight":0.651062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"},{"name":"Sherlock Holmes","weight":0.588429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes"},{"name":"Philadelphia","weight":0.440396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.398527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Pastiche","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche"},{"name":"Melbourne","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.221729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"September 10","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_10"},{"name":"Mystery fiction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction"},{"name":"American Academy of Neurology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Neurology"},{"name":"IPad","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Humanities","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Communist Party of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"House music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music"},{"name":"662","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/662"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Clifton, Bristol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton,_Bristol"},{"name":"Doctor Robert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Robert"},{"name":"Gerald Ford","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford"},{"name":"Unfinished creative work","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_creative_work"},{"name":"Saint Peter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Lees, Greater Manchester","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lees,_Greater_Manchester"}]}
