{"id":15767,"title":"Campylobacteriosis in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to evaluate epidemiological situation of campylobacteriosis in Poland in 2012, compared to the situation in previous years.The evaluation was based on analysis of data from the annual bulletin \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland\" 2011-2012 (MP Czarkowski et al., NIZP-PZH and Chief Sanitary Inspectorate-GIS), information from the forms of individual cases reports from the epidemiological investigations in outbreaks of campylobacteriosis, submitted by the sanitary-epidemiological stations to the Department of Epidemiology and data from the Department of Demographic Studies of the Central Statistical Office. Cases were classified according to a surveillance case definition.In 2012, 431 cases of campylobacteriosis were registered in Poland, which was 30% more than in 2011. The incidence was 1.12/100 000. All reported cases were classified. No deaths were recorded. More than 84% of cases of campylobacteriosis occurred in four provinces - Warmi?sko-Mazurskie (35%), ?l?skie (22%), Mazowieckie (14%) and the Malopolskie (14%). The highest incidence was observed in the Warmi?sko-Mazurskie- 6.47/100 000. As in previous years, the percentage of hospitalized cases was 57.5%. Campylobacter species was identified in more than 77% of patients, and it was found that 70% of the cases were caused by C. jejuni and about 7% by C. coli. As in previous years, the majority of cases (343, 79%) occurred in the age group 0-4. Five family outbreaks caused by Campylobacter were recorded in 2012.In Poland Campylobacteriosis is rarely diagnosed, confirmed and reported. Routine diagnosis of infection with Campylobacter sp. is performed only in the two provinces.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135507","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.710111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.583757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.560592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.516713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.22199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Campylobacter","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Campylobacteriosis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacteriosis"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesser Poland Voivodeship","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Poland_Voivodeship"},{"name":"Campylobacter jejuni","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter_jejuni"},{"name":"Central Statistical Office (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Statistical_Office_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"431","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/431"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Central Statistical Office (Poland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Statistical_Office_(Poland)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Masovian Voivodeship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masovian_Voivodeship"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
