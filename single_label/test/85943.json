{"id":85943,"title":"Characterisation of an OCS-dependent severe asthma population treated with mepolizumab.","abstract":"A subpopulation of patients with asthma treated with maximal inhaled treatments is unable to maintain asthma control and requires additional therapy with oral corticosteroids (OCS); a subset of this population continues to have frequent exacerbations. Alternate treatment options are needed as daily use of OCS is associated with significant systemic adverse effects that affect many body systems and have a direct association with the dose and duration of OCS use. We compared the population demographics, medical conditions and efficacy responses of the OCS-dependent group from the DREAM study of mepolizumab with the group not managed with daily OCS.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834924","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.82565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.49679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.266588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.177943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Mepolizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mepolizumab"},{"name":"Dream (mixed martial arts)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_(mixed_martial_arts)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Glossary of tennis terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tennis_terms"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
