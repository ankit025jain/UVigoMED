{"id":39642,"title":"Inhibition of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich containing family, pyrin-domain containing 3 inflammasome reduces the severity of experimentally induced acute pancreatitis in obese mice.","abstract":"Acute pancreatitis (AP), although most often a mild and self-limiting inflammatory disease, worsens to a characteristically necrotic severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in about 20% of cases. Obesity, affecting more than one-third of American adults, is a risk factor for the development of SAP, but the exact mechanism of this association has not been identified. Coincidental with chronic low-grade inflammation, activation of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich containing family, pyrin-domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome increases with obesity. Lean mice genetically deficient in specific components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are protected from experimentally induced AP, indicating a direct involvement of this pathway in AP pathophysiology. We hypothesized that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with the sulfonylurea drug glyburide would reduce disease severity in obese mice with cerulein-induced SAP. Treatment with glyburide led to significantly reduced relative pancreatic mass and water content and less pancreatic damage and cell death in genetically obese ob/ob mice with SAP compared with vehicle-treated obese SAP mice. Glyburide administration in ob/ob mice with cerulein-induced SAP also resulted in significantly reduced serum levels of interleukin 6, lipase, and amylase and led to lower production of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated interleukin 1? release in cultured peritoneal cells, compared with vehicle-treated ob/ob mice with SAP. Together, these data indicate involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in obesity-associated SAP and expose the possible utility of its inhibition in prevention or treatment of SAP in obese individuals.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152324","annotations":[{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Lipase","weight":0.675823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"},{"name":"Sulfonylurea","weight":0.675045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.663374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.660967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.638921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.303061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Glibenclamide","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibenclamide"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.03307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Water content","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_content"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
