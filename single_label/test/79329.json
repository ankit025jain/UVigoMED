{"id":79329,"title":"Hearing aid user guides: suitability for older adults.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to analyse the content, design, and readability of printed hearing aid user guides to determine their suitability for older adults, who are the main users of hearing aids.Hearing aid user guides were assessed using four readability formulae and a standardized tool to assess content and design (SAM - Suitability Assessment of Materials).A sample of 36 hearing aid user guides (four user guides from nine different hearing aid manufacturers) were analysed.Sixty nine percent of user guides were rated 'not suitable' and 31% were rated 'adequate' for their suitability. Many scored poorly for scope, vocabulary, aspects of layout and typography, and learning stimulation and motivation. The mean reading grade level for all user guides was grade 9.6 which is too high for older adults.The content, design, and readability of hearing aid user guides are not optimal for older adults and thus may serve as a barrier to successful hearing aid outcomes for this population.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447232","annotations":[{"name":"Learning","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.379276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Typography","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.302103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.250838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Vocabulary","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Formula","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula"},{"name":"Material","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Surface-to-air missile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile"},{"name":"Readability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability"},{"name":"Ninth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_grade"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Page layout","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"}]}
