{"id":86696,"title":"Are endothelial microparticles early markers of pulmonary hypertension?","abstract":"To find out the relation between endothelial microparticles (EMPs), pulmonary arterial stiffness and thickness of pulmonary artery intima media to determine the prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome and their correlation with echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters.Sixteen patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and 37 control patients were included. Electron microparticles levels, angiographic and echocardiographic findings were compared.Thickness of pulmonary arterial intima media and systolic and diastolic diameters of pulmonary artery were found significant in the patient group. CD144 and CD146 EMP values of patient group were statistically high. However, there was not any significant difference in pulmonary arterial strain, elasticity and stiffness. Positive significant relationship was found between pulmonary artery intima media thickness and CD144 in patient group. But there was not any significance between CD 146 and pulmonary artery intimamedia thickness.Invasive methods remain as the gold standard for pulmonary hypertension diagnosis, follow-up and treatment, but it is risky and can even be fatal. Our study showed that EMPs, thickness of pulmonary artery intima media and pulmonary stiffness could be novel noninvasive modalities for the follow-up pulmonary hypertensive patients.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749910","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.659376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tunica intima","weight":0.361724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_intima"},{"name":"Eisenmenger's syndrome","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenmenger's_syndrome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Arterial stiffness","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_stiffness"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Electromagnetic pulse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse"},{"name":"CD146","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD146"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"News media","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Johann Andreas Eisenmenger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Andreas_Eisenmenger"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Microparticles","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microparticles"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"}]}
