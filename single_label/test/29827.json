{"id":29827,"title":"Perspectives on the future of postmarket vaccine safety surveillance and evaluation.","abstract":"Strong, scientifically-based postmarket safety surveillance is critical to maintaining public confidence in vaccinations and reducing the burden from vaccine-preventable diseases. The infrastructure and scientific methods for postmarket safety surveillance have continuously improved over the last 30 years, with major enhancements in the last decade. Supporting and enhancing this system will continue to be important as the number of vaccines and people vaccinated expands globally.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606417","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Postmarketing surveillance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmarketing_surveillance"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Bank run","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run"}]}
