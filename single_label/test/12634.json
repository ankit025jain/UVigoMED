{"id":12634,"title":"Emerging filoviral disease in Uganda: proposed explanations and research directions.","abstract":"Outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg virus diseases have recently increased in frequency in Uganda. This increase is probably caused by a combination of improved surveillance and laboratory capacity, increased contact between humans and the natural reservoir of the viruses, and fluctuations in viral load and prevalence within this reservoir. The roles of these proposed explanations must be investigated in order to guide appropriate responses to the changing epidemiological profile. Other African settings in which multiple filoviral outbreaks have occurred could also benefit from such information.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515940","annotations":[{"name":"Ebola","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Marburg virus","weight":0.69991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg_virus"},{"name":"Natural reservoir","weight":0.689429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Uganda","weight":0.583969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.487161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Marburg","weight":0.0506351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Plant virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_virus"}]}
