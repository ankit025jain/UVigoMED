{"id":85511,"title":"Synergistic antitumor activity of recombinant human Apo2L/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in malignant pleural mesothelioma.","abstract":"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, currently incurable tumor with increasing incidence in industrialized countries. Tumor necrosis factor-related, apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family, which induces cancer cell death through extrinsic apoptotic pathway, while sparing normal cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor activity of recombinant human Apo2L/TRAIL (dulanermin) in combination with chemotherapy in MPM in vitro and in vivo.In the present studies, we employed a panel of MPM cell lines to test the antitumor activity of recombinant human Apo2L/TRAIL (T) in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (CP) in vitro and SCID mice.Results demonstrated a significant increase of apoptosis in cell lines treated with CPT compared with those receiving CP or T as single agents. This synergistic effect was dependent on the ability of CP to increase the expression of the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 in a p53 manner. The CPT combination was also effective in blocking the growth of MPM cell lines in a SCID mice preclinical model.CPT increases MPM cell death in vitro and in vivo compared with CP. In vitro results suggest that chemotherapy sensitizes MPM to TRAIL-dependent apoptosis through p53 activation and subsequent upregulation of DRs.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922007","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Carboplatin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboplatin"},{"name":"Mesothelioma","weight":0.868312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.843613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.715993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pemetrexed","weight":0.656303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemetrexed"},{"name":"Severe combined immunodeficiency","weight":0.643183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_combined_immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.579468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.369513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"SCID mice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCID_mice"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
