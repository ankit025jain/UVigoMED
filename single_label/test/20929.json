{"id":20929,"title":"Analysis of a potential cluster of rhinovirus infections in patients and staff on two haemato-oncology wards.","abstract":"Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause the common cold, increased mortality in patients attending elderly care facilities and significant morbidity as well as mortality in the post-transplantation setting.The aim of the study was to determine if there had been a breakdown in infection control practice in a large haemato-oncology centre. Molecular techniques had detected increased numbers of HRV in respiratory samples from patients and staff over a 6-week period. Typing was performed to investigate the possibility of transmission between individuals.This was a retrospective study having detected HRV RNA in combined nose and throat swab samples that were collected from 13 individuals: 8 patients and 5 staff members, in the haemato-oncology wards of a tertiary referral centre in January and February 2011. The 5'NTR and the VP4/VP2 region were used for HRV typing.All 3 HRV species were detected with 7 HRV-A, 1 HRV-B, 4 HRV-C and 1 untyped. None of the individuals were infected by the same HRV serotype. Three individuals had multiple samples collected: 1 patient had an HRV-B infection over a 4-week period, 1 patient had an HRV-A infection over 3 months and 1 staff member had an HRV-C infection over 1 week, each shedding an unchanged serotype throughout the whole period.Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that there was no breakdown in infection control measures. No transmission incidents had occurred between patients and/or between staff and patients.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630953","annotations":[{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.708355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.637545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.582394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.550418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.375049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Molecular clock","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Elderly care","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderly_care"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Type theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory"},{"name":"Typewriter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter"},{"name":"Vice president","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"VP3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP3"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Viral shedding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding"}]}
