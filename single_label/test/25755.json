{"id":25755,"title":"[Effects of coronary angioplasty on clinical status, perfusion myocardial contractility in patients with ischemic chronic heart failure].","abstract":"Chronic heart failure (CHF) remains widespread and prognostically unfavorable complication of various cardiovascular diseases. Most patients with CHF have atherosclerosis of coronary arteries. Main method of treatment of this condition is endovascular revascularization. In this study we conducted detailed analysis of effects of transluminal balloon coronary angioplasty (TBCA) with stenting on clinical-functional status, changes of perfusion and contractility of left ventricular myocardium in patients with CHF of ischemic etiology. We also identified factors producing unfavorable impact on restoration of myocardial perfusion after stenting.
