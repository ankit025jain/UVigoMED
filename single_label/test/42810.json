{"id":42810,"title":"JK1 (FAM134B) gene and colorectal cancer: a pilot study on the gene copy number alterations and correlations with clinicopathological parameters.","abstract":"The aims of the study are to characterize changes in JK-1 (FAM134B) at the DNA level in colorectal adenocarcinoma and adenoma and exploring the possible correlations with clinical and pathological features.JK-1 gene DNA copy number changes were studied in 211 colorectal carcinomas, 32 colorectal adenoma and 20 colorectal non-cancer colorectal tissue samples by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results were correlated with clinical and pathological parameters.Colorectal adenomas were more likely to be amplified than deleted with regard to JK-1 (FAM134B) DNA copy number change. The copy number level of JK-1 (FAM134B) DNA in colorectal adenocarcinomas was significantly lower in comparison to colorectal adenomas. Changes in JK-1 (FAM134B) DNA copy number were associated with histological subtypes, and cancer stage. Lower copy numbers were associated with higher tumor stage, lymph node stage and overall pathological stage of cancer. Conversely, higher DNA copy numbers were detected more often in the mucinous adenocarcinoma.This is the first study showing significant correlations of the JK-1 (FAM134B) gene copy number alterations with clinical and pathological features in a large cohort of pre-invasive and invasive colorectal malignancies. The changes in DNA copy number associated with progression of colorectal malignancies reflect that JK-1 (FAM134B) gene could play a role in controlling some steps in development of the invasive phenotypes.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825067","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.539201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.527483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.141444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene dosage","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_dosage"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.111667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.0299364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
