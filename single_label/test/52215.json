{"id":52215,"title":"Diabetes risk, diagnosis, and control: do psychosocial factors predict hemoglobin A1c defined outcomes or accuracy of self-reports?","abstract":"To evaluate the accuracy of self-reported diabetes among multi-ethnic older adults by psychosocial factors and assess predictors of diabetes risk, diagnosis, and control.The 2006 Health and Retirement Study (N=5,594) was used to determine agreement between self-reported diabetes and measured diabetes (HbA1c> or = 6.5%) by age, sex, race/ethnicity, nativity, education, health insurance coverage, body mass index, depressive symptoms, and prior report of racial discrimination. We also examined associations between these factors and pre-diabetes (HbA1c > or = 6.0-<6.5%) among individuals without diabetes, and those with undiagnosed and poorly controlled (HbA1c > or = 8.0%) diabetes.Accuracy of self-reported diabetes was good (ie, sensitivity > or = 80% and specificity > or = 95%) among all demographic subgroups and across most social strata. Among those who reported racial discrimination, sensitivity of self-reported diabetes was lower among Blacks who reported racial discrimination in comparison to Blacks who did not report racial discrimination (82.7% vs 89.0%) an association that was marginally statistically significant (P=.05). Blacks and Hispanics had higher odds of pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and poor glycemic control.Self-reported diabetes corresponded well with HbAlc assessed disease for all social strata examined in this sample of multi-ethnic older adults. Blacks with a history of racial discrimination may be less likely to know diabetes status.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620444","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.812462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.77724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.462222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Racism","weight":0.401818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.322892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.235029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.22868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.22529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Retirement","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.132269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.111378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
