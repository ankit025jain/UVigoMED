{"id":52184,"title":"Regulation of glucose homoeostasis by brown adipose tissue.","abstract":"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has emerged as a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. Activation of BAT in human beings could also have beneficial metabolic effects that might resolve common complications of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, by ameliorating the glucolipotoxic pathological changes that underlie the development of peripheral insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion due to pancreatic ?-cell failure. Evidence from rodent models suggests that BAT activation improves glucose homoeostasis through several mechanisms, which could point to new strategies to optimise stimulation of BAT in human beings and reverse insulin resistance in peripheral tissues.
