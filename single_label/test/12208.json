{"id":12208,"title":"Tissue oxygen is reduced in white matter of spontaneously hypertensive-stroke prone rats: a longitudinal study with electron paramagnetic resonance.","abstract":"Small vessel disease is associated with white-matter (WM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hyperintensities (WMHs) in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and subsequent damage to the WM. Although WM is vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic injury and O? is critical in brain physiology, tissue O? level in the WM has not been measured and explored in vivo. We hypothesized that spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHR/SP) fed a Japanese permissive diet (JPD) and subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO), a model to study VCI, would lead to reduced tissue oxygen (pO?) in the deep WM. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring WM tissue pO? using in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry in SHR/SP rats over weeks before and after JPD/UCAO. The SHR/SP rats experienced an increase in WM pO? from 9 to 12 weeks with a maximal 32% increase at week 12, followed by a dramatic decrease in WM pO? to near hypoxic conditions during weeks 13 to 16 after JPD/UCAO. The decreased WM pO? was accompanied with WM damage and hemorrhages surrounding microvessels. Our findings suggest that changes in WM pO? may contribute to WM damage in SHR/SP rat model, and that EPR oximetry can monitor brain pO? in the WM of small animals.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549186","annotations":[{"name":"White matter","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.85513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Paramagnetism","weight":0.737545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.722947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Electron paramagnetic resonance","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_paramagnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.564559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.521785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.502939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.426749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.375305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.351504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.28582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.280056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.269077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.238155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.224504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.217446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Hypoxia (environmental)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Working memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
