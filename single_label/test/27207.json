Observations were made on the indigenous people of North of the Russian Federation. Using methods of the theory of chaos-self-organization the differences in the parameters of quasi-attractors of the human state vector of cardio-vascular system of the people of Russian Federation North were shown. Comparison with the results obtained by classical statistics was made.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051755","annotations":[{"name":"Gerontology","weight":0.721119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.71709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.622247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.473167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.438497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.431648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.305341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.166472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Federation of Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Australia"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Yugra","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugra"}]}
