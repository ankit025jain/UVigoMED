{"id":21342,"title":"Detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin by polymerase chain reaction in multiplex format.","abstract":"S. Dublin has caused widespread concerns in cattle produce. Using a comparative genomic method, two specific targets like SeD_A1118 and SeD_A2283 for S. Dublin identification were firstly obtained. An efficient multiplex PCR for S. Dublin detection based on the two novel specific genes and invA was therefore developed.
