{"id":86943,"title":"Influenza A viruses of avian origin circulating in pigs and other mammals.","abstract":"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are zoonotic agents, capable of crossing the species barriers. Nowadays, they still constitute a great challenge worldwide. The natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses are wild aquatic birds, despite the fact they have been isolated from a number of avian and mammalian species, including humans. Even when influenza A viruses are able to get into another than waterfowl population, they are often unable to efficiently adapt and transmit between individuals. Only in rare cases, these viruses are capable of establishing a new lineage. To succeed a complete adaptation and further transmission between species, influenza A virus must overcome a species barrier, including adaptation to the receptors of a new host, which would allow the virus-cell binding, virus replication and, then, animal-to-animal transmission. For many years, pigs were thought to be intermediate host for adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans, because of their susceptibility to infection with both, avian and human influenza viruses, which supported hypothesis of pigs as a 'mixing vessel'. In this review, the molecular factors necessary for interspecies transmission are described, with special emphasis on adaptation of avian influenza viruses to the pig population. In addition, this review gives the information about swine influenza viruses circulating around the world with special emphasis on Polish strains.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25184409","annotations":[{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Natural reservoir","weight":0.826497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir"},{"name":"Swine influenza","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Waterfowl","weight":0.782514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfowl"},{"name":"Speciation","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Intermediate host","weight":0.736716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_host"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Human flu","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flu"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.442761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.442358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.439532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.327877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.240107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Aquatic animal","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.027246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Anseriformes","weight":0.020329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anseriformes"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"}]}
