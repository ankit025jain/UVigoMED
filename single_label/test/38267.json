{"id":38267,"title":"Clinical findings of acquired vitelliform lesions associated with retinal pigment epithelial detachments.","abstract":"To study clinical findings associated with acquired vitelliform lesions in retinal pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs).Retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series.We retrospectively reviewed 32 eyes of 24 patients (22 men, 2 women; age range [mean], 58-85 [73.7] years) with acquired vitelliform lesions.All eyes had acquired vitelliform lesions in the central macula associated with a serous PED at baseline. Of the 32 eyes, 30 (93.8%) were observed for 12 months, 26 (81.3%) for 24 months, and 17 (53.1%) for 36 months. The mean logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) levels were 0.19 at month 12, 0.28 at month 24, and 0.25 at month 36, none of which differed significantly from baseline. The mean changes in the BCVA were declines of 0.38, 1.29, and 1.21 lines at months 12, 24, and 36, respectively. Of 7 eyes treated with 3 consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, the serous PEDs remained in all 7 eyes and the mean changes of BCVA were a decline of 2.40 lines 12 months after the first injection and a decline of 3.58 lines at the final visit. In the 24 untreated eyes, the mean change in the BCVA was a decline of 0.25 line at the final visit, which differed significantly (P = .021) compared with that of the treated eyes at the final visit.Intravitreal injections of ranibizumab were ineffective because of the absence of resolution of the PEDs and the declines in VA.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439441","annotations":[{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.666593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.622519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.608405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.439412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.361966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.260156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.213484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Shahidka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahidka"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Detachment (military)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(military)"}]}
