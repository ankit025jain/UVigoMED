{"id":8687,"title":"Astroviruses in Polish commercial turkey farms in 2009-2012.","abstract":"Avian astrovirus infections are widespread in many countries, and infections have been connected with enteritis and increased mortality in young birds. In the present study, fecal samples were collected during 2009-2012 from a total of 156 meat turkey flocks. Astrovirus presence and type differentiation was performed with the use of two molecular diagnostic approaches. Out of 156 flocks, 48.7% were found to be TAstV positive. Depending on the method used for type differentiation, TAstV-2 and TAstV-1 prevalence was between 31.4%-41% and 9.6%-15.4%, respectively. No avian nephritis virus was detected. About 30% of astrovirus-positive flocks were infected with both types of TAstV. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial polymerase gene sequence revealed the genetic variability of isolated TAstV, and most of the detected TAstV-2 belonged to the European lineage of astroviruses. Statistical analysis suggested the positive but weak correlation between the presence of astrovirus and health status (slightly more frequent detection of TAstV in sick, diarrheic birds) and also negative medium correlation between age and astrovirus occurrence.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758130","annotations":[{"name":"Feces","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.77463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.684657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.592681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.567968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.507254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.309458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.28029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.264821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.17051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Genetic variability","weight":0.104326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variability"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.04944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Astrovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrovirus"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}]}
