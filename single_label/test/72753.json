{"id":72753,"title":"3-Hydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyflavone suppresses Bcl-w-induced invasive potentials and stemness in glioblastoma multiforme.","abstract":"3-Hydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyflavone (HDMF) is a natural chemical product that is not currently regarded as a drug. In our study, we employed glioblastoma cells and cell biology and biochemistry approaches to investigate the potential of HDMF as a natural anticancer therapy option. FACS analysis showed that treatment concentration of HDMF does not exert cytotoxicity on U251 cells. Wound-healing and invasion assays showed that HDMF dose-dependently decreased the migratory and invasive potentials of these cells, likely by indirectly inhibiting MMP-3 activity as a result of the inhibition of p38 and ERK signaling proteins - an effect of HDMF also shown by Western blotting. HDMF inhibits Bcl-w-induced neurosphere formation and the expression of glioma stem cell markers, such as Musashi, Sox-2 and c-myc. These results indicate that HDMF suppresses migratory or invasive potentials and stemness and functions as a negative agent against the aggressiveness of glioblastoma cells. We propose that HDMF has potential as anticancer drug for inhibiting the aggressiveness of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
