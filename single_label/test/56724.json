{"id":56724,"title":"[The effectiveness of endonasal electrophoresis of neuroprotective agents used in the rehabilitative treatment of the patients presenting with primary open angle glaucoma].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to estimate the effectiveness of the peptide drug cortexin used to treat primary open angle glaucoma. It was shown that endonasal electrophoresis of cortexin resulted in more pronounced positive changes in the dynamics of clinical, functional, perimetric, and electrophysiological characteristics compared with intramuscular administration of the same drug to the patients of the control group. This difference was apparent both immediately after the termination of the treatment and during the long-term follow-up.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640653","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.808451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.605737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.587739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.512929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.395357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.295312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
