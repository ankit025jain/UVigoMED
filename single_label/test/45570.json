{"id":45570,"title":"Bone mineral density and bone turnover in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C and sustained virological response to antiviral therapy with peginterferon-alfa and ribavirin.","abstract":"Patients with chronic hepatitis C have low bone mineral density and increased bone resorption related to serum transaminase levels. Elevated serum soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR-55) receptor levels may play a role in the bone mass loss in these patients. Bone mass is improved and bone turnover normalized in patients who respond to antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin.Low bone mineral density (BMD) has been described in patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV). The study objective was to evaluate the effect of antiviral therapy on BMD and bone metabolism in non-cirrhotic HCV patients with sustained virological response.We conducted a prospective study in 36 consecutive outpatients from the general community with non-cirrhotic HCV and an early and sustained virological response to peginterferon-alfa and ribavirin therapy. Determinations of BMD (dual X-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine and femoral neck) and biochemical measurements of bone metabolism and sTNFR-55 were made at baseline, after 24 and 48 weeks of antiviral therapy, and at 48 weeks after the end of treatment.Patients had a significantly reduced BMD, which significantly increased during the follow-up. Serum levels of sTNFR-55 and bone turnover markers were increased at baseline and significantly reduced at all subsequent time points. We found an inverse correlation between BMD and both serum aminotransferase levels and urine deoxypyridinoline (D-pyr) and a positive correlation between serum aminotransferases and both urine D-Pyr and serum sTNFR-55.Patients with chronic hepatitis C have low bone mass associated with increased bone resorption, and some relationship can be expected between serum aminotransferase levels and the degree of bone mass loss. Bone mass may be improved and bone turnover normalized in patients who respond to antiviral therapy. Elevated serum sTRFR-55 levels may play a role in the bone mass loss of these patients.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676843","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.910259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.830534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.772203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.643627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.46808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.439776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.389775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.239407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.18094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0520876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
