{"id":81052,"title":"Clinical and serological evolution in chronic Chagas disease patients in a 4-year pharmacotherapy follow-up: a preliminary study.","abstract":"The role of trypanocidal therapy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease remains controversial.A total of 13 patients with chronic Chagas disease were treated with benznidazole (5mg/kg/day/60 days) and surveyed via antibody measurement and conventional electrocardiogram over the course of 4 years.The antibody titers were significantly reduced after 4 years (p<0.05). Most of the patients showed maintenance of the initial clinical picture (electrocardiographic), with the exception of 4 cases.Although trypanocidal therapy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease was of limited effectiveness, we believe that it is beneficial in treating these patients.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474023","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.83303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.792442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.560168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Benznidazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benznidazole"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"}]}
