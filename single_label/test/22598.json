{"id":22598,"title":"Primary application of PPE68 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","abstract":"PPE68 protein is absent from BCG and the attenuated strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). In this study, the shuttle plasmid pBudCE4.1/PPE68/OriM was constructed and transformed into BCG to obtain PPE68 recombination BCG (PPE68-rBCG), and BALB/c mice were immunized with PPE68-rBCG to evaluate the immunological characterization of PPE68-rBCG. The level of lgG2a, IFN-?, IL-12 and IL-4 in serum of immunized mice were detected, the proliferation response of spleen lymphocyte were measured, the frequency of CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD4(+)/CD8(+) were determined, and the spleen and lung tissue were prepared for pathological analysis. PPE68-rBCG was constructed successfully and could induce powerful Th1 immune response in mice. Besides, we took the purified recombination PPE68 (rPPE68) protein as diagnostic antigen to detect pulmonary tuberculosis patients (n=252) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients (n=66). We also used anti-PPE68 polyclonal antibody as coating antibody to detect specific antigen in the same serum samples. Our data provide an experimental basis for potential application of rPPE68 in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially for extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
