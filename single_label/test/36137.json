{"id":36137,"title":"Topiramate monotherapy use in women with and without epilepsy: pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.","abstract":"To evaluate fetal or neonatal outcomes (with a focus on major congenital anomalies) with use of topiramate monotherapy and to examine whether differences occurred in the reporting and patterns of these outcomes for pregnant women with and without epilepsy.Spontaneous, postmarketing reports involving women who used topiramate monotherapy during pregnancy from 18 July 1995 (International Birth Date of topiramate) through 30 April 2011 were retrieved from the sponsor's (Janssen Research & Development, LLC) Global Medical Safety database. All formulations for topiramate, used as monotherapy, were selected for the analysis. Monotherapy was defined as any situation where no other AED was listed in the pregnancy case report, either as a suspect or concomitant medication, regardless of indication. Results were summarized descriptively.A total of 1163 cases of women who used topiramate monotherapy during pregnancy (for any indication) were retrieved from the Global Medical Safety database. Since some women used topiramate for more than one indication, there were a total of 1199 reported indications for topiramate monotherapy, which were primarily for treatment of epilepsy (n=599), accounting for half of the indications, and migraine prophylaxis (n=240, 20.0%). Out of 1163 cases, pregnancy outcome was reported in 50.6% (n=589). Live birth was the most frequently reported outcome, regardless of indication (epilepsy, 78.8% [312/396]; prophylaxis of migraine, 59. 3% [48/81]; other indication, 64.4% [85/132]). Cleft lip or palate anomalies (epilepsy, n=15; migraine, n=2; other indication, n=4; and indication not reported, n=2), limb, hand, or other skeletal anomalies (epilepsy, n=13; migraine, n=2; other indication, n=0; and indication not reported, n=1), and respiratory or cardiovascular anomalies (epilepsy, n=12; migraine, n=1; other indication, n=1; and indication not reported, n=2) were the most often reported major fetal or neonatal anomalies. More reported major fetal or neonatal anomalies occurred in patients being treated for epilepsy (53/79 anomaly-indication pairs) compared with patients being treated for migraine prophylaxis (10/79 anomaly-indication pairs).Although incidence rates cannot be calculated based on spontaneous adverse event reporting, this summary of reported pregnancy and neonatal outcomes with use of topiramate monotherapy suggests that the risk for major fetal or neonatal anomalies may differ based on the indication for topiramate.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598456","annotations":[{"name":"Topiramate","weight":0.930425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiramate"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.879595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.813139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.812643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.753652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.393099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Postmarketing surveillance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmarketing_surveillance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Oral contraceptive formulations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_contraceptive_formulations"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"}]}
