{"id":88798,"title":"Osteoporosis knowledge in patients with a first fragility fracture in Puerto Rico.","abstract":"To determine the level of knowledge about osteoporosis and factors associated with low level of knowledge in patients with a first osteoporotic fracture.A cross-sectional study in adult patients with a first osteoporotic fracture admitted to the University Hospital of the Puerto Rico Medical Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico was performed. Socio-demographic parameters, clinical features, and pharmacologic treatment were examined. A validated questionnaire was used to assess subjects' level of knowledge about osteoporosis. Differences between study groups were evaluated using chi-square and Student's t tests, as appropriate.A total of 54 patients participated in the study. The mean (SD) age was 73.7 (10.7) years; 77.8% were females. Overall, 61.1% of the participants had a low level of knowledge about osteoporosis. Patients with low level of knowledge were more likely to have the Puerto Rico Government health insurance, lower level of education, and higher hip FRAX scores than those with mid/high level of knowledge. Also, they were less likely to receive osteoporosis counseling by their primary care physicians (PCP), have prior BMD measurement, receive bisphosphonates/raloxifene treatment, and to take calcium and vitamin D supplements.In this population of Hispanic patients with a first osteoporotic fracture, the majority had a low level of knowledge about osteoporosis. Low knowledge was associated with low socio-economic status, lack of counseling about osteoporosis by PCP, prior BMD measurement, and osteoporosis treatment. Better efforts should be undertaken to educate, identify, and manage patients at risk for osteoporotic fractures.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791357","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.724856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.511079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.449573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.447351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.360129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.344055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.276865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.258378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"San Juan, Puerto Rico","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Phencyclidine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
