{"id":29962,"title":"Does cannabis smoking predispose to lung bulla formation?","abstract":"The data of a consecutive series of habitual marijuana smokers were retrospectively evaluated and compared with that of non-marijuana smokers to assess differences between the 2 groups.13 consecutive habitual marijuana smokers were referred for treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax. The demographic, clinical, radiological, and pathological findings of these patients were reviewed and compared with 140 non-marijuana smokers treated for the same pathology at the same time.Bullae were seen in 8/13 (62%) and 110/140 (78%) of marijuana smokers and non-marijuana smokers, respectively. However, when patients less than 35-years old were considered, the incidence of bulla was higher in marijuana smokers than non-marijuana smokers (7/10 vs. 3/10, p?<?0.05). The pathological findings showed a greater presence of inflammatory cells in specimens from marijuana smokers than those of non-marijuana smokers (8/11 vs. 2/42, respectively, p?<?0.05). No significant differences in hospital stay and clinical outcome were registered between the 2 groups.Despite the fact that we were unable to demonstrate that marijuana had a causal role in the development of emphysema, our study showed that marijuana smokers had a higher incidence of inflammatory cells in pathological specimens, which may favor lung injury, thus predisposing to bulla formation.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585646","annotations":[{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.636135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.524889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.317819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Blister","weight":0.130376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"811","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/811"},{"name":"813","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/813"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Cannabis smoking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_smoking"},{"name":"Bulla (seal)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulla_(seal)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Habitual aspect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_aspect"}]}
