{"id":53510,"title":"Relationship of maternal serum resistin and visfatin levels with gestational diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Adiponectin, resistin and visfatin are thought to play role in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes (GDM). In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of maternal second trimester serum resistin and visfatin levels with GDM.Screening and diagnosis for GDM was performed between the 24-28th gestational weeks. About 40 women diagnosed with GDM and 40 non-diabetic women constituted the study and control groups, respectively. Groups were compared for second trimester maternal serum resistin, visfatin and HbA1c levels, HOMA-IR and postpartum 75?g OGTT results.Mean serum resistin (p?=?0.071) and visfatin (p?=?0.194) levels were similar between the groups. However, mean BMI (p?=?0.013), HOMA-IR (p?=?0.019), HbA1c (p?<?0.0001) and birth weight (p?=?0.037) were significantly higher in GDM group compared to controls. Type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance were detected in 2 (5%) and 7 (20%) women in the GDM group, respectively, with 75?g OGTT performed at the postpartum 6th week. Resistin levels of patients with GDM and postpartum glucose intolerance were higher than those with GDM but no postpartum glucose intolerance (p?=?0.012). Visfatin levels in the GDM group showed a positive correlation with biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length (p?<?0.05).Maternal serum resistin and visfatin levels are unchanged in GDM. In patients with GDM, second trimester resistin levels may be predictive for postpartum glucose intolerance and second trimester visfatin levels may be related with fetal biometric measurements. Further larger studies are needed.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512558","annotations":[{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.855207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.849146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.767749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.75335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.575749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Resistin","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistin"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.355971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.256854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.25322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.25035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
