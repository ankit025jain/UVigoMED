{"id":65614,"title":"[New topics regarding equations for GFR estimation based on serum creatinine and cystatin C].","abstract":"Japanese GFR equations and CKD-EPI equations based on standardized serum creatinine and standardized cystatin C are recommended in recent Japanese CKD guides and KDIGO guidelines for CKD management, respectively. CKD-EPIcreat overestimates GFR in Japanese subjects, probably due to the difference in muscle mass between Japanese and Caucasians. Unlike CKD-EPIcreat, CKD-EPIcys performs well in Japanese subjects, indicating the advantages of using cystatin C as a GFR marker. KDIGO guidelines suggest measuring eGFRcys in adults with eGFRcreat of 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m2 who do not have markers of kidney damage if confirmation of CKD is required. Creatinine is excreted by glomerular filtration, but also secreted by the tubules. Alteration of the tubular secretion of creatinine may influence the performance of GFR equations based on serum creatinine. Multivariate analysis showed that GFR and serum albumin levels were independent parameters affecting the fractional excretion of creatinine (FE-Cr). Alteration of FE-Cr according to the serum albumin levels may be one of the reasons for the bias of GFR equations based on serum creatinine. Low GFR is a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a general population. However, the relationship between eGFR and the hazard risk of events is different depending on whether cystatin C or creatinine is used to calculate eGFR. The association between eGFRcys and the hazard risk is much stronger compared with eGFRcreat. Cystatin C may be a useful alternative to creatinine for detecting a high risk of complications in a general population and subjects with CKD.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800491","annotations":[{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.662126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Renal physiology","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.585048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.336485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.325721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.316352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Cystatin C","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin_C"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.270684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.257768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Cystatin","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
