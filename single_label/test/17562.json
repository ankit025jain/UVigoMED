{"id":17562,"title":"Detection of TEM-, SHV- and CTX-M-type ?-lactamase production among clinical isolates of Salmonella species.","abstract":"Enteric fever is a major public health problem in developing countries. Due to the problem of resistance to first-line drugs and fluoroquinolone, cephalosporins are currently used for treatment of enteric fever. Cephalosporin resistance in Salmonella spp. is mainly due to production of extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBLs). The majority of ESBLs in Salmonella are derivatives of the TEM and SHV ?-lactamase families. The objectives of this study were to detect antibiotic susceptibility patterns, ESBL production and TEM-, SHV- and CTX-M-encoding genes (blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M) among clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. A total of 134 Salmonella isolates [Salmonella Typhi (n = 101), Salmonella Paratyphi A (n = 31), Salmonella Paratyphi B (n = 1) and Salmonella Typhimurium (n = 1)] were included in this study. Multidrug resistance was seen in 5/134 (3.73%) isolates, all of which belonged to serotype S. Typhi. A better susceptibility profile was observed for first-line drugs (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and tetracycline) and cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefixime and cefepime). However, 131 (97.76%) of the 134 isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and one (0.75%) was resistant to ciprofloxacin. TEM-1-type ?-lactamase (blaTEM-1) was detected in six (4.47%) of the 134 isolates, which belonged to the serotype S. Typhi. All six TEM-positive isolates were negative for the blaSHV gene and none of the isolates was positive for the blaCTX-M gene. The presence of the blaTEM gene encoding TEM-1 ?-lactamase is believed to confer resistance only to penicillins and early cephalosporins; however, the resistance spectrum of TEM-1 descendants may extend to second-, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. The ESBLs derived from TEM-1 differ from their progenitors by as few as 1 aa, and have the ability to hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. Therefore, appropriate selection and rotation of antibiotics as well as continuous monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility profiles could help to control the emergence and spread of resistant strains.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24866367","annotations":[{"name":"Cefepime","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefepime"},{"name":"Chloramphenicol","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramphenicol"},{"name":"Tetracycline","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline"},{"name":"Nalidixic acid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalidixic_acid"},{"name":"Cefotaxime","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Ceftriaxone","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone"},{"name":"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole"},{"name":"Cefixime","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefixime"},{"name":"Salmonella enterica","weight":0.879508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.855723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.824276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.813139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Salmonella enterica enterica","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica_enterica"},{"name":"Ceftazidime","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.607454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.5204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.50524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby-Bauer_antibiotic_testing"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
