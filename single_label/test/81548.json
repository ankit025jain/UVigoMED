{"id":81548,"title":"Immediate functional loading of single implants: a 1-year interim report of a 5-year prospective multicentre study.","abstract":"The aim of this prospective multicentre study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of immediately loaded single implants.Patients were recruited at six clinical centres. Inclusion criteria were singletooth replacement in fully healed sites or post-extraction sockets with adequate bone height and width, to place an implant of at least 3.5 mm in diameter and 10.0 mm in length. All implants (AnyRidge, MegaGen, Gyeongbuk, South Korea) were functionally loaded immediately after placement. After 3 months, final crowns were delivered. All implants were followed for 1 year. Outcome measures were: implant stability; complications; peri-implant marginal bone level changes; probing pocket depth.Fifty-seven implants (38 in the maxilla and 19 in the mandible) were placed in 46 patients (23 males, 23 females, aged between 18 to 73 years). Ten implants were placed in post-extraction sockets. Two patients (two implants) withdrew from the study and were classified as drop-outs. At the end of the study, only one implant was lost in a healed site. All the surviving implants were stable, giving an overall 1-year survival rate of 97.7% (patient-based). A few complications (one patient experienced swelling after surgery, two had loosened abutments and another patient had a ceramic crown fracture) were encountered. After 1 year of functional loading, the patients had lost an average of 0.32 mm (± 0.22) of peri-implant marginal bone; the mean probing pocket depth (PPD) was 2.16 mm (± 0.68).Within its limit (limited number of patients treated and self-evaluation of the outcomes), this study supports the concept that immediate functional loading of single dental implants can be a successful treatment procedure, with satisfactory clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24977254","annotations":[{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.643984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.569567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.443706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.411975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.304556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.28687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.262867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.238296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Ceramic","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"16 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Dropout (bicycle part)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropout_(bicycle_part)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Gyeongsangbuk-do","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongsangbuk-do"}]}
