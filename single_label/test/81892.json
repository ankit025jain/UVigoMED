{"id":81892,"title":"Prenatal diagnosis of a giant epignathus teratoma in the third trimester of pregnancy using three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Case report.","abstract":"A 20-year-old nulliparous woman was referred due a cervical mass in the fetus in an ultrasound examination performed in the 25th week of pregnancy. The exam revealed an irregular, solid-cystic heterogeneous mass measuring 75x54 mm that came to the exterior through the mouth of the fetus. Three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of epignathus teratoma and the normal finding of the central nervous system. The patient was admitted at 28 weeks, in premature labor. Tocolysis, corticosteroid and amniotic fluid drainage were programmed to be performed before conducting ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT). However, there was premature rupture of membranes and the EXIT procedure was brought forward. After premature placental abruption, the newborn's birth was concluded. Tracheostomy was performed, but the newborn's condition progressed to bradycardia and death in a few minutes.
