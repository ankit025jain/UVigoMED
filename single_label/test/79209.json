{"id":79209,"title":"Balloon dilatation for congenital nasal piriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS): a novel conservative technique.","abstract":"Congenital nasal piriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is an uncommon but important cause of nasal obstruction in infants. When it is severe, nasal decongestants or temporary nasal airway devices cannot address the problem adequately. The most common surgical technique used to treat the bony piriform aperture stenosis is the sublabial approach and drill-out of the nasal aperture followed by nasal stenting. This paper describes an infant with bilateral CNPAS who underwent a single successful balloon dilatation and short-term stenting of the nasal piriform apertures without the need for additional procedures.
