{"id":82727,"title":"[The therapy of masticatory organ dysfunctions (CMD)].","abstract":"The authors have been dealing with disorders of the masticatory organ (CMD) for several decades and they published their experience and summarized findings that they have gained from over 2,000 cases. They gave a summary of masticatory organ dysfunction diagnostics in 3rd issue of Fogorvosi Szemle in 2011. In their current paper they discuss the treatment of masticatory organ dysfunctions (CMD) according to the logic of diagnostic algorythm and they present it to the practising dentist. They would like to emphasize that it is not allowed to indicate any treatment especially an irreversible one, without a diagnosis. The cause of the disease can very often be identified or specified after the symptom relieving treatment. After summarizing the general treatment principles depending on the functional condition of the masticatory organ, they give a detailed explanation of systematic functional therapy, i.e., symptomatic treatment or medical treatment, physiotherapy, occlusal splint therapy and the definitive treatment that follows (such as occlusal adjustment, prosthetic rehabilitation, orthodontics and surgical intervention). They classify the occlusal instruments (splint), which are often misinterpreted or not used in the proper way in practice (and bibliography), according to indications. They outline some orthodontic anomalies in connection with the masticatory organ: on the one hand when the patient who undergoes an orthodontic treatment has a latent or manifest masticatory organ dysfunction (CMD), on the other hand when the dysfunction appears during the orthodontic treatment. Among the definitive treatment principles they emphasize the gnathological aspects of prosthetic rehabilitation. They draw attention to the maintenance therapy of patients suffering from masticatory organ dysfunction.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551958","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.731179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Logic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.337683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Occlusal splint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusal_splint"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0230596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
