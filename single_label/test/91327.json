{"id":91327,"title":"Bilateral femoral neck insufficiency fractures secondary to vitamin D deficiency and concurrent corticosteroid use--a case report.","abstract":"We present a rare case of a 67-year-old Indian female who was found to have bilateral insufficiency of the neck of femur fractures secondary to osteomalacia from vitamin D deficiency, with her symptoms exacerbated by a course of oral steroids prescribed for suspected polymyalgia rheumatica.Bilateral femoral neck fractures are rare and are known to be associated with a variety of conditions such as parathyroid or renal dysfunction.We present a rare case of a 67-year-old Indian female who was found to have bilateral insufficiency of the neck of femur fractures secondary to osteomalacia from vitamin D deficiency, with her symptoms exacerbated by a course of oral steroids prescribed for suspected polymyalgia rheumatica.In patients with severe bilateral hip pain and a normal pelvic radiograph, it is important to consider magnetic resonance imaging early to avoid missing this important diagnosis.Osteomalacia and vitamin D deficiency is an important differential diagnosis in any patient presenting with bone and muscle pain. Vitamin D levels are easily available and deficiency is easily treated.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515953","annotations":[{"name":"Osteomalacia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomalacia"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.80334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.79517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Myalgia","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.657446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.467802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.319367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.265522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Polymyalgia rheumatica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyalgia_rheumatica"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
