{"id":24340,"title":"Migration and mycoses.","abstract":"In recent years, the incidence of fungal infections of the skin, one of the most frequent forms of infection, has been steadily increasing in Europe. One of the main factors contributing to this increase is the gradual raise of migratory flows towards Europe. In the last decades Italy has witnessed an ever-increasing growth of the migrant population, and has become, to this day, one of the European countries with the highest number of immigrants. This phenomenon has had significant implications in clinical practice of dermatologic mycology as it is increasingly common to see unusual clinical isolate causal agents absent in our latitudes until a short time ago. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, classification, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and treatment of the most important dermato-mycosis observed in the immigrant population, through the most typical cases, investigated by microscopic and cultural findings. These diseases continue to expand and are often difficult to detect. The special relationship between host-environment interaction-parasite plays a crucial role as, even more than in other categories, it is widely widespread among the immigrants.
