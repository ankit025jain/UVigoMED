{"id":59772,"title":"[Roles of osteoblasts in hematopoietic stem cell niche and relationship between osteoblasts and hematopoietic diseases].","abstract":"Hemopoietic stem cells(HSCs) are regulated by two niches: osteoblastic niche and vascular niche. Osteoblasts are the critical constitutive regulators of the osteoblastic niche. The significance of osteoblasts for hematopoietic disease has not escaped attention. This review attempts to capture the discoveries of the last few years regarding the role of osteoblasts in hematopoietic stem cell niche and relationship between osteoblasts and hematopoietic diseases.
