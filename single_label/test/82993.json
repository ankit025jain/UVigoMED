{"id":82993,"title":"Oral cancer: review of current management strategies.","abstract":"India has one of the highest incidences of oral cancer and accounts for about 30% of all new cases annually. A high prevalence of smokeless tobacco use has led to an increasing incidence, which in combination with delayed presentation has made oral cancer a major health problem in India. Limited access to cancer care, relative lack of trained healthcare providers and financial resources are some of the challenges to the management of oral cancer in India despite improvements in diagnostic techniques and management strategies.We reviewed the literature pertaining to the epidemiology, aetiopathogenesis, pre-malignancy, tumour progression, management of the primary site, mandible, neck lymph node metastases, reconstruction options and screening of oral cancer. The parameters evaluated were overall survival, disease-free survival, recurrence and loco-regional control.Nine studies on surgical intervention were reviewed. There were 23 studies on the management of chemotherapy and 30 trials analysing radiotherapy as an intervention.India has one of the highest incidences of oral cancer and delayed stage presentation is common. Surgery remains the treatment of choice and adjuvant treatment is recommended in high-risk patients. Elective neck dissection is warranted in clinically lymph node-negative neck for patients with thick tumours, imaging-suspected lymph nodes and those who may not have a reliable follow-up. Functional outcomes and treatment-related morbidity needs to be considered, and reconstruction with free tissue transfer provides the best results.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476162","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.682332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.673513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"India","weight":0.661754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.636602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.600084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.256577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0908804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Dipping tobacco","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipping_tobacco"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Paganism (contemporary religions)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism_(contemporary_religions)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
