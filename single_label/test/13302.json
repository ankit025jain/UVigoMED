{"id":13302,"title":"Migration of neutrophils targeting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease mouse model.","abstract":"Immune responses in the brain are thought to play a role in disorders of the central nervous system, but an understanding of the process underlying how immune cells get into the brain and their fate there remains unclear. In this study, we used a 2-photon microscopy to reveal that neutrophils infiltrate brain and migrate toward amyloid plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest a new molecular process underlying the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
