{"id":28757,"title":"A multifaceted intervention to improve mental health literacy in students of a multicampus university: a cluster randomised trial.","abstract":"The aim of the current study was to assess whether a multifaceted intervention could improve mental health literacy, facilitate help seeking and reduce psychological distress and alcohol misuse in students of a multicampus university in Melbourne, Australia.In this cluster randomized trial, nine university campuses were paired (some pairs included more than one campus), with one of each pair randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition. The interventions were designed to be whole-of-campus and to run over 2 academic years with their effectiveness assessed through recruitment of a monitoring sample of students from each campus. Interventions included emails, posters, campus events, factsheets/booklets and mental health first aid training courses. Participants had a 20-min telephone interview at baseline and at the end of academic years 1 and 2. This assessed mental health literacy, help seeking, psychological distress and alcohol use. The primary outcomes were depression and anxiety levels and alcohol use and pertained to the individual level.There were no effects on psychological distress and alcohol use. Recall of intervention elements was greater in the intervention group at the end of year 2. Students in the intervention group were more likely to say they would go to a drug and alcohol centre for alcohol problems at the end of 6 months.Although education and awareness may play a role in improving mental health literacy, it is likely that, to achieve changes in psychological distress, interventions would need to be more personalized and intensive.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797396","annotations":[{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.734974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.669015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"First aid","weight":0.583299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid"},{"name":"University","weight":0.574663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Melbourne","weight":0.573715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.518291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.490252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.463922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Campus","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Email","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Health literacy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy"},{"name":"Poster","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Centrism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism"},{"name":"Personalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Breast cancer awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_awareness"},{"name":"Health effects from noise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise"}]}
