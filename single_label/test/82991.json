{"id":82991,"title":"Long-term analysis of osseointegrated implants in non-smoker patients with a previous history of periodontitis.","abstract":"To evaluate long-term clinical and radiographic parameters of osseointegrated implants in non-smoker patients with a previous history of chronic periodontitis.Fifty-four screw-type implants with a moderately roughened surface and internal hexagonal implant-abutment connection were placed according to a two-phase protocol and 40 reference teeth were analysed at baseline, and after 5 and 10 years. Pocket probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing were analysed 6x/tooth in all teeth, implants and reference teeth. Radiographic peri-implant bone level was measured on the mesial and distal surfaces. The prevalence of peri-implantitis and the survival rate of the implants were assessed at the patient and implant levels. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Wald Z-test, at ? = 5%.In implants, the CAL at 5 years was 0.3 mm higher, and at 10 years 1.2 mm higher in comparison to baseline. The corresponding data for the reference teeth were 0 mm and 0.5 mm respectively. Multilevel testing showed statistical difference for PPD between implants and teeth over time. After 10 years, the mean mesial bone loss was 0.63 ± 0.26 mm, and the mean distal bone loss was 0.56 ± 0.25. The survival rates were 100% and 92.3% for the implants in the mandible and the implants in the maxilla respectively.Screw-type implants with internal hexagon placed in patients with a previous history of periodontitis attending a regular maintenance programme demonstrated stable clinical and radiographic results after 5 and 10 years.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476577","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.679199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.493984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.420661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Chronic periodontitis","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.244565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.228691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.171201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.132397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.110465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Hexagon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/560"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Bilevel rail car","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilevel_rail_car"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"}]}
