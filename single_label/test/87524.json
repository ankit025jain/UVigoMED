{"id":87524,"title":"[Effect of postoperative analgesia with dexmedetomidine on the survival rate of amputated finger replantation].","abstract":"To observe the effect of postoperative analgesia with dexmedetomidine on the survival rate of amputated finger replantation.91 cases, who was going to receive amputated finger replantation, were randomly divided into group A (n = 48) and B (n = 43). PCIA (patient-controlled intravenous analgesia) was set immediately after operation in group A (fentanyl 1.0 mg + tropisetron 4.0 mg + 10 mg + dexmedetomidine 200 microg + saline 100 ml) and group B (same as group A except dexmedetomidine). Background infusion is 2 ml/h with a bolous of 0.5 ml and lockout time is 15 min. postoperative VAS score, Ramsay score, condition of replanted fingers and other adverse events at the 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h and 24-48 h were recorded and analyzed.The age, sex, height, weight, amputated time (Ts), revascularized time (Tt) in the two groups were not statistically different (P > 0.05). Postoperative VAS score in the two groups was significantly different at the 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h and 24-48 h (P < 0.05), but Ramsay score was not (P > 0.05). The highest and lowest postoperative VAS score and Ramsay score were markedly different between two groups (P < 0.05). 3 of the 60 fingers in group A experienced vascular crisis and 2 underwent vascular explore surgery. 13 of 56 fingers in group B occurred vascular crisis, and 10 underwent vascular explore surgery, showing significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). PCIA adverse reactions showed no difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Bradycardia and hypotension didn't happen in any patients in the two groups. 4 weeks after surgery, the survival rate was 96.7% (58/60) in group A, and 83.9% (47/56) in group B (P < 0.05).Postoperative analgesia with dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant can increase the survival rate of replantation fingers with high safety.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112010","annotations":[{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Tropisetron","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropisetron"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.764111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Bradycardia","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.684374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.509272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.479126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.389311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.25947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.244936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Dexmedetomidine","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmedetomidine"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"1224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1224"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Replantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replantation"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Lockout (industry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockout_(industry)"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"}]}
