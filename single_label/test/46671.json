{"id":46671,"title":"The effects of different mechanisms on the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis in an ERCP model in rats.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of different mechanisms on the development of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.40 male rats were randomly divided into four groups. After laparotomy, in Group 1, only duodenum was reached by a 24G cannula without performing any other procedure. In Groups 2, 3, and 4, biliopancreatic duct was cannulated transduodenally. Group 2 received no additional intervention after the cannulation. Group 3 received saline, whereas Group 4 received contrast agent into the duct. After a period of 24 hours, all rats were sacrificed. Laboratorytests for blood samples were performed and pancreatic tissue was also evaluated histopathologically.Leukocyte, blood sugar, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, C-reactive protein, and base excess parameters were evaluated. The values in Groups 2, 3, and 4 were found to be significantly higher than those in the control group, except for leukocyte count and base excess (p=0.551, p=0.031, p=0.0001, p=0.0001, p=0.0001, p=0.0001, p=0.683, respectively). Histopathological results demonstrated significant differences between the groups. Highest pathological damage scores were observed in Groups 3 and 4.Among different theories for the pathogenesis of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis, elevated intraductal hydrostatic pressure was observed to be the main underlying cause.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623284","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.738775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.496718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.398606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.305469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.193635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Hydrostatic pressure","weight":0.168048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_pressure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.119479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Fluid statics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_statics"},{"name":"Lactiferous duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactiferous_duct"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"}]}
