{"id":85932,"title":"Randomized trial of acetylcysteine in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","abstract":"Acetylcysteine has been suggested as a beneficial treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, although data from placebo-controlled studies are lacking.In our initial double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients who had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with mild-to-moderate impairment in pulmonary function to receive a three-drug regimen of prednisone, azathioprine, and acetylcysteine; acetylcysteine alone; or placebo. The study was interrupted owing to safety concerns associated with the three-drug regimen. The trial continued as a two-group study (acetylcysteine vs. placebo) without other changes; 133 and 131 patients were enrolled in the acetylcysteine and placebo groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the change in forced vital capacity (FVC) over a 60-week period.At 60 weeks, there was no significant difference in the change in FVC between the acetylcysteine group and the placebo group (-0.18 liters and -0.19 liters, respectively; P=0.77). In addition, there were no significant differences between the acetylcysteine group and the placebo group in the rates of death (4.9% vs. 2.5%, P=0.30 by the log-rank test) or acute exacerbation (2.3% in each group, P>0.99).","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836309","annotations":[{"name":"Azathioprine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.812232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Acetylcysteine","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.618498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.330556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.314732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.26113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"}]}
