{"id":67614,"title":"Effect of local infiltration analgesia on post-operative pain following TVT-O: a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of a protocol of local anesthesia and epinephrine associated with sedo-analgesia on post-TVT-O pain in comparison with infiltration of saline and epinephrine.Forty-two patients undergoing TVT-O were randomized into two groups to receive periurethral infiltration with epinephrine only (group A, n = 21) or with epinephrine plus 1 % lidocaine hydrochloride (group B, n = 21). Post-operative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (maximum pain possible), 1, 6, 12 and 24 h after the procedure. The total amount of analgesia was recorded and the proportion of women reporting a pain VAS score ?4, 1 h after the procedure was calculated. ANOVA for repeated measures and Bonferroni correction, the Student's t test for independent samples, the Mann-Whitney U test, the Fisher exact test, or the ? (2) test for parametric was used.Pain level was significantly lower in group B 1 (p = 0.01) and 6 h (p = 0.05) after surgery, but not 12 and 24 h after the procedure. No significant difference was observed in the proportion of women requesting analgesia and in the total dosage of analgesics between the two groups. A significant higher proportion of women in group A reported a pain VAS score higher than four 1 h after surgery in comparison with patients in group B.This randomized study seems to indicate that systematic infiltration before TVT-O positioning with local anesthetic may reduce immediate post-operative pain.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599566","annotations":[{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.901855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.749826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.572639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.189562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Bonferroni correction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Parametric statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Carlo Emilio Bonferroni","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Bonferroni"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
