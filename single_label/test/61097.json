{"id":61097,"title":"[Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and their relation with early response to treatment in patients with low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome (IPSS score ? 1.0) and chronic aplastic anemia].","abstract":"The purpose of this study was retrospectively to analyze the peripheral blood lymphocyte subset distribution in patients with low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (IPSS ? 1.0) and chronic aplastic anemia (CAA), and their hematological changes of peripheral blood after treatment, so as to understand differences and their relation with early treatment response. The lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of 67 patient with low or intermediate risk MDS (IPSS ? 1.0), 54 patients with CAA and 73 healthy individuals were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that Th cells, Th/Ts ratio in peripheral blood of low or intermediate risk MDS were 42.94% ± 10.80% and 1.80% ± 0.99% respectively, and were significantly higher than those in control group; the CD16(+) CD56(+) cell ratio was 11.22% ± 7.97%, and was significantly lower than that in control group, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); Ts cells and CD19(+) cell ratio in peripheral blood of CAA patients were 30.87% ± 9.11% and 16.98% ± 7.40% respectively, and were significantly higher than those in control group; CD16(+) CD56(+) cell ratio was 9.81% ± 7.00%, and was significantly lower than that in normal control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); while the Th cells and Th/Ts ratio in low or intermediate risk MDS group were significantly higher than those in CAA group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). After treatment for 6 mouths, the HI-E and HI-N rates in CD19(+) cell normal group of low or intermediate risk MDS patients were 18.2% (4/22) and 13.6% (3/22), and were significantly lower than that in the increased group and decreased group. In Ts cell increased group HI-N rate was 15.4% (2/13), and was significantly lower than that in normal group and decreased group. In Th/Ts ratio decreased group HI-N rate was 14.3% (2/14), and was significantly lower than that in the increase group and normal group, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). After treatment of CAA for 6 months, the effective rate for CD3(+) cells, Th cells, Th/Ts ratio in decreased group was 71.4% (5/7), 56.3% (9/16), 50.0% (10/20), and were significantly higher than those in increased and normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets of low or intermediate risk MDS(IPSS score ? 1.0) and CAA are abnormal, and these lymphocyte subsets are related with hematologic changes after early response to treatment.
