{"id":87139,"title":"Association between efavirenz as initial therapy for HIV-1 infection and increased risk for suicidal ideation or attempted or completed suicide: an analysis of trial data.","abstract":"The relationship between efavirenz use and suicidality is not well-defined.To compare time to suicidality with efavirenz-containing versus efavirenz-free antiretroviral regimens for initial treatment of HIV.AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites; 74% of participants enrolled in the United States.Antiretroviral-naive participants.Efavirenz versus efavirenz-free regimens.Suicidality was defined as suicidal ideation or attempted or completed suicide. Groups were compared with a hazard ratio and 95% CI estimated from a Cox model, stratified by study.Seventy-three percent of participants were men, the median age was 37 years, and 32% had documented psychiatric history or received psychoactive medication within 30 days before entering the study. Median follow-up was 96 weeks. Suicidality incidence per 1000 person-years was 8.08 (47 events) in the efavirenz group and 3.66 (15 events) in the efavirenz-free group (hazard ratio, 2.28 [95% CI, 1.27 to 4.10]; P = 0.006). Incidence of attempted or completed suicide was 2.90 (17 events) and 1.22 (5 events) in the efavirenz and efavirenz-free groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 2.58 [CI, 0.94 to 7.06]; P = 0.065). Eight suicides in the efavirenz group and 1 in the efavirenz-free group were reported.There was not a standardized questionnaire about suicidal ideation or attempt. Efavirenz was open-label in 3 of 4 studies.Initial treatment with an efavirenz-containing antiretroviral regimen was associated with a 2-fold increased hazard of suicidality compared with a regimen without efavirenz.National Institutes of Health.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979445","annotations":[{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.485177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.442905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.319866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.317447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Psychiatric history","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_history"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"History","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.113354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Efavirenz","weight":0.10897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efavirenz"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"AIDS Clinical Trials Group","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_Clinical_Trials_Group"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
