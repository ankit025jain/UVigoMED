{"id":51622,"title":"[Premature ovarian failure treated with acupoint catgut implantation and artificial periodic therapy: a randomized controlled trial].","abstract":"To compare the difference in the clinical efficacy on premature ovarian failure (POF) between the acupoint catgut implantation combined with artifical periodic therapy and the simple artificial periodic therapy and explore its effect mechanism.Sixty-five patients of POF were randomized into the two groups. In a western medication group, 32 cases were treated with the artificial periodic therapy with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. In a catgut implantation + western medication group, 33 cases were treated with the acupoint catgut implantation combined with artificial periodic therapy. The acupoints of Neiguan (PC 6), Zusanli (ST 36), Guanyuan (CV 4) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6) were selected. The treatment was lasted for half a year and the follow-up visit was for another half a year in the two groups. Kupperman index was used to assess the improvements in the clinical symptoms. The levels of serum sexual hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) were evaluated of the patients in the two groups before and after treatment. The efficacy was compared between the two groups.The scores of the clinical symptoms were all significantly improved after treatment and in the follow-up in the two groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). In the 6-month follow-up visit after treatment, the result in the catgut implantation + western medication group was better than that in the western medication group (8.17 +/- 1.19 vs 13.68 +/- 1.08, P < 0.01). FSH was reduced after treatment in the two groups (all P < 0.01) and E2 was increased (all P < 0.05). The curative and remarkably effective rates were 75.8% (25/33) and 81.8% (27/22) after treatment and in the follow-up visit in the catgut implantation + western medication group, which were better than 67.9% (19/28) and 53.6% (15/28) in the western medication group separately (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).The acupoint catgut implantation combined with artificial periodic therapy achieve the remarkable improvements in the clinical symptoms of POF in the patients and the better results as compared with the simple western medication therapy. The combined therapys efficacy is stable and the long-term efficacy is apparently superior. The effect mechanism is related to the improvements in the serum sexual hormone levels.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673050","annotations":[{"name":"Premature ovarian failure","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ovarian_failure"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.789621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.782348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medroxyprogesterone","weight":0.77716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medroxyprogesterone"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.687135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.598234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.485294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.446431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.129052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Catgut","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgut"},{"name":"Medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medroxyprogesterone_17-acetate"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"}]}
