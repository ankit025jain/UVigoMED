{"id":45504,"title":"Hepatic fat accumulation with sparing associated with portal vein duplication.","abstract":"Duplication of the portal vein is a rare congenital anomaly. We experienced a case of duplication of the portal vein associated with hepatic fat accumulation with sparing. Fat accumulation was seen in the central portion of the liver, which was supplied by the portal vein coursing upward to the porta hepatis (Portal Vein 2), and sparing of fatty liver was seen in the peripheral portion of the liver, which was supplied by the portal vein entering the liver inferiorly (Portal Vein 1).
