{"id":22892,"title":"Kibdelomycin is a potent and selective agent against toxigenic Clostridium difficile.","abstract":"Clostridium difficile is the causative agent of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), with increased risk in elderly populations. Kibdelomycin, a novel natural-product inhibitor of type II topoisomerase enzymes, was evaluated for activity against C. difficile and gastrointestinal anaerobic organisms. Toxigenic C. difficile isolates (n=168) from U.S. hospitals and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (n=598) from Chicago-area hospitals were tested. Kibdelomycin showed potent activity against toxigenic C. difficile (MIC90=0.25 ?g/ml) and most Gram-positive aerobic organisms but had little activity against Bacteroides species (MIC50>32 ?g/ml; n=270). Potent anti-C. difficile activity was also observed in the hamster model of C. difficile colitis. Dosing at 1.6 mg/kg (twice-daily oral dose) resulted in protection from a lethal infection and a 2-log reduction in C. difficile cecal counts. A 6.25-mg/kg twice-daily oral dose completely eliminated detectable C. difficile counts in cecal contents. A single 6.25-mg/kg oral dose showed that cecal contents were exposed to the drug at >2 ?M (eightfold higher than the MIC), with no significant plasma exposure. These findings support further exploration of kibdelomycin for development of an anti-C. difficile agent.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24514098","annotations":[{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Bacteroides","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroides"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Anaerobic organism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.760471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hamster","weight":0.526543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Topoisomerase","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.2563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.221435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Type II topoisomerase","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_topoisomerase"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.125146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.0169658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Dosing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosing"}]}
