{"id":85810,"title":"Pandemic influenza plans in residential care facilities.","abstract":"To identify characteristics of residential care facilities (RCFs) associated with having a pandemic influenza plan.Nationally representative, cross-sectional survey.RCFs in the United States.Participating facilities in the 2010 National Survey of RCFs (N = 2,294), representing 31,030 assisted living facilities and personal care homes.Facility-level characteristics associated with a pandemic influenza plan, including general organization descriptors, staffing, resident services, and immunization practices.Forty-five percent (95% confidence interval (CI) = 43-47%) had a pandemic plan, 14% (95% CI = 13-16%) had a plan in preparation, and 41% (95% CI = 38-43%) had no plan. In the multivariable model, organization characteristics, staffing, and immunization practices were independently associated with the presence of a pandemic preparedness plan. Organization characteristics were larger size (extra large, OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.96-5.46; large, OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.81-3.75; medium, OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.21-2.27 vs small), not-for-profit status (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.31-2.09 vs for profit), and chain affiliation (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.31-2.09 vs nonaffiliated). Staffing characteristics included number of registered nurse hours (<15 minutes, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.74 vs no hours), any licensed practical nurse hours (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.08-1.99 vs no hours), and at least 75 hours of required training for aides (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.05-1.71 vs <75 hours). RCFs with high staff influenza vaccination rates (81-100%, OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.27-3.53 vs 0% vaccinated) were also more likely to have a pandemic plan.A majority of RCFs lacked a pandemic influenza plan. These facilities were smaller, for-profit, non-chain-affiliated RCFs and had lower staff vaccination rates. These characteristics may help target facilities that need to develop plans to handle a pandemic, or other disasters.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852422","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.729008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.610813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.514076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Registered nurse","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_nurse"},{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.317323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.146605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Influenza pandemic","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Licensed practical nurse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensed_practical_nurse"},{"name":"Assisted living","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_living"},{"name":"813","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/813"},{"name":"1316","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1316"},{"name":"License","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"965","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/965"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Crisis of the Late Middle Ages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Late_Middle_Ages"},{"name":"Care of residents","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_of_residents"},{"name":"Employment agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_agency"},{"name":"Profit (accounting)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Residential area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_area"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"}]}
