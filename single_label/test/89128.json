{"id":89128,"title":"Short-term follow-up of pertrochanteric fractures treated using the proximal femoral locking plate.","abstract":"The proximal femoral locking compression plate is a fixed angled anatomically contoured stainless steel plate used to treat pertrochanteric fractures of the proximal femur. Recent reports quote a high failure rate associated with this implant. We aimed to identify the common methods of failure and determine the elements of surgical techniques that could be altered to potentially improve outcomes should this implant be used for the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fractures.Retrospective chart analysis.Three separate centers.Twenty-nine patients with 29 fractures.All patients were treated for pertrochanteric fractures using the proximal femoral locking compression plate.The patient demographics, fracture classification, implant details, and complications.Twelve of 29 fractures (41.4%) suffered a complication associated with the implant, and 83% of these occurred in elderly women. Complications included bending, backing-out, fracture, or cut-out of the proximal screws and plate fracture. Common technical errors included the following: (1) leaving the plate proud proximally, (2) malposition of the proximal screws within the femoral neck/head, (3) inappropriate use of the hook plate, (4) creating too ridged a construct when used as a bridging plate.Our experience with the use of this implant suggests an unacceptably high failure rate (41.4%). A knowledge of the common pitfalls encountered when using this device is critical in an effort to reduce failure rates. Based on our data, we would urge caution when considering this device for unstable pertrochanteric fractures, especially in the elderly female.Prognostic Level IV.
