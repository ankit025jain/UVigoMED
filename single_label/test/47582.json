{"id":47582,"title":"Non-neoplastic hepatic vascular diseases: spectrum of CT and MRI appearances.","abstract":"The unique dual blood supply of the liver makes it one of the common sites for various vascular neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Increasing use of multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to increased identification of numerous non-neoplastic vascular entities apart from already well-known neoplastic lesions. The objective of this review is to describe the causes and clinical features and to familiarize the reader with the key imaging features of various non-neoplastic vascular diseases affecting the liver. Non-neoplastic vascular diseases are classified broadly as those affecting the hepatic veins, portal veins, hepatic artery, intrahepatic shunts, and other miscellaneous conditions.
