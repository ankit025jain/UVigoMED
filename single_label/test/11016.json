{"id":11016,"title":"The Canine Orthopedic Index. Step 3: Responsiveness testing.","abstract":"To determine whether the Canine Orthopedic Index (COI) can detect changes in dogs with osteoarthritis (OA) treated with either non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or placebo.Double blind randomized placebo controlled trial.Dogs (n = 80) with OA.Owners completed the COI on Day 0. Dogs were administered either carprofen or placebo on days 1 through 14. Owners completed the COI again on Day 14. The change in total instrument, stiffness, gait, function, and quality of life scores were assessed between groups.Dogs administered carprofen had significant decreases in the total instrument score (P = .002) as well as 3 of the 4 factor scores compared to dogs treated with placebo (stiffness score P = .015; gait score P = .001; and function score = 0.008). The change in quality of life score was not significantly different between carprofen and placebo treated dogs (P = .124).The COI delivered the decreases in total instrument, stiffness, gait, and function scores that one would expect in dogs with OA treated with an NSAID compared with placebo administration. In this cohort of dogs, the quality of life score was not sensitive to the changes associated with NSAID administration.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617818","annotations":[{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.883832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Double blind","weight":0.56361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_blind"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.559439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.464782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.457468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.445686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.424516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.30633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.261987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.247942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Carprofen","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carprofen"},{"name":"Cytochrome c oxidase","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase"},{"name":"Double (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Vowel reduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Responsiveness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsiveness"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"}]}
