{"id":92736,"title":"Markers of endothelial dysfunction and evaluation of vascular reactivity tests in Beh√ßet disease.","abstract":"We assessed endothelial dysfunction (ED) in patients with Behcet disease (BD; n=40) and healthy controls (n=20). Serum lipid, homocysteine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), and ultrasonographic flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) were measured. Mean hsCRP, ESR, homocysteine, and ADMA were significantly higher in the BD group (P<.001 for all). Patients with active BD had higher serum levels of hsCRP, homocysteine, and ESR compared with those in remission (P<.001, P<.001, and P=.005, respectively). Flow-mediated dilatation was significantly lower in patients with BD than in controls (P=.001). Flow-mediated dilatation correlated negatively with BD duration and serum ADMA levels (P<.001, r=-.745 and P<.001, r=-.682); a positive correlation was seen between serum ADMA levels and BD duration (P<.001, r=.552). Only stepwise multivariate regression analysis revealed BD duration to have a significant effect on FMD. Flow-mediated dilatation, in conjunction with markers of inflammation, may evaluate ED in patients with BD.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24277913","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.739923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.668446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.608277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Asymmetric dimethylarginine","weight":0.493989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_dimethylarginine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.42989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"682","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/682"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Bachelor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"}]}
