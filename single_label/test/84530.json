{"id":84530,"title":"Outcome measures of behavioral weight loss programs in perimenopause.","abstract":"Obesity and being overweight are associated with many comorbid conditions and are major contributing factors to cardiovascular disease. The increased proportion of overweight and obese people in Western societies has been attributed largely to behaviors that include sedentary lifestyle and dietary excess. Women are at particular risk during perimenopause, when hormones change and metabolism slows. The purpose of this review was to examine published studies of weight loss programs for perimenopausal women using behavioral change strategies of diet alone, regular physical activity alone, or both in combination to determine the range of potential outcomes and reduction of cardiovascular risks. Based on the findings from this review, practice applications and recommendations for future research are proposed.
