{"id":63686,"title":"Clofarabine in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.","abstract":"Clofarabine is a second-generation purine nucleoside analog approved in 2004 for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) following failure of at least two prior regimens. Clofarabine is a hybrid of fludarabine and cladribine, designed to overcome the pharmacologic limitations associated with its predecessors, while retaining their beneficial properties. In addition to providing a valuable treatment option for pediatric patients with ALL, clofarabine alone and in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) has demonstrated substantial activity against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), thus rendering this agent a potential therapeutic option for MDS.This review focuses on the pharmacology and clinical activity of clofarabine in MDS, as well as its emerging role in the treatment of MDS. Publications in English were selected from the MEDLINE (PubMed) database, as well articles of interest from bibliographies and abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials.DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy for many patients with MDS who require treatment. Although these agents are very well tolerated and represent a significant advancement in the treatment of MDS by improving transfusion requirements and prolonging survival in various subgroups of patients, response rates are modest and the duration of response is short. In addition to providing a valuable treatment option for pediatric ALL patients, clofarabine has substantial activity against MDS and is well tolerated by elderly patients, thus rendering it a potential therapeutic option.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410313","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.820679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.801242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Purine","weight":0.786005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.70222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.658894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cladribine","weight":0.599617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladribine"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.57516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Fludarabine","weight":0.532951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.499217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.461729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.386686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clofarabine","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clofarabine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Nucleoside analog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_analog"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.0224886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Abstract (summary)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
