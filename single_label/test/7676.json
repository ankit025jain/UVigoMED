{"id":7676,"title":"Use of a morphometric method and body fat index system for estimation of body composition in overweight and obese cats.","abstract":"To develop morphometric equations for prediction of body composition and create a body fat index (BFI) system to estimate body fat percentage in overweight and obese cats.Prospective evaluation study.76 overweight or obese cats ? 1 year of age.Body condition score (BCS) was determined with a 5-point scale, morphometric measurements were made, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was performed. Visual and palpation-based evaluation of various body regions was conducted, and results were used for development of the BFI system. Best-fit multiple regression models were used to develop equations for predicting lean body mass and fat mass from morphometric measurements. Predicted values for body composition components were compared with DEXA results.For the study population, prediction equations accounted for 85% of the variation in lean body mass and 98% of the variation in fat mass. Values derived from morphometric equations for fat mass and lean mass were within 10% of DEXA values for 55 of 76 (72%) and 66 of 76 (87%) cats, respectively. Body fat as a percentage of total body weight (ie, body fat percentage) predicted with the BCS and BFI was within 10% of the DEXA value for 5 of 39 (13%) and 22 of 39 (56%) cats, respectively.The BFI system and morphometric equations were considered accurate for estimation of body composition components in overweight and obese cats of the study population and appeared to be more useful than BCS for evaluation of these patients. Further research is needed to validate the use of these methods in other feline populations.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846428","annotations":[{"name":"Fat","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.661481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.432493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.282159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.263254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.241769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.223825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Body fat percentage","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"British Film Institute","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Film_Institute"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"},{"name":"Felidae","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae"},{"name":"Bowl Championship Series","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series"}]}
