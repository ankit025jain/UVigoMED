{"id":66787,"title":"Conditioned medium derived from mesenchymal stem cells culture as a intravesical therapy for cystitis interstitials.","abstract":"The treatment of Interstinal Cystitisis (IC) is still challenge for urologist. Available therapies do not result in long-term control of symptoms and do not provide pain relive to patients. Unique abilities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) could be used to develop new treatment approaches for Interstitial Cystitis. Conditioned Medium (CM) derived from MSC culture is rich in plenty of growth factors, cytokines and trophic agents which were widely reported to enhance regeneration of urinary bladder in different conditions. This ready mixture of growth factors could be used to develop intravesical therapy for patients with IC. MSC-CM has anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, supportive, angiogenic, immunosuppressive and immunomodulative properties and seems to be ideal substance to prevent IC recurrence and to create favorable environment for regeneration of damaged bladder wall.
