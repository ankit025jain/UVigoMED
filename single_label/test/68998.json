{"id":68998,"title":"[Health related quality of life and kidney transplantation: a comparison with population values at 6 months post-transplant].","abstract":"Transplantation is an effective treatment for end stage renal failure. The aim of this study was to compare patient's perceived health related quality of life (HRQoL) with population values, at one moth and 6 moths of kidney post-transplantation.The Questionnaire of Quality of Life in Kidney Disease was administered during the first month and also at the 6 months following transplantation. A comparison with the general population was done with the generic part of the questionnaire. In the statistical analyses, typical standardized scores were used.In this study 72 patients were included with a median age of 57 years. At the 6 month post-transplantation, the patient's HRQoL showed values that were similar to the general population. When we compared the HRQoL at the first month and at the 6 month post-transplantation, the differences of HRQoL were significant in all dimensions, except on the General health and Emotional role.At 6 moths after transplantation, there was an improvement in the perceived HRQoL that was similar to the general population.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480289","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.799238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.511895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.475366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.306543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Moth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
