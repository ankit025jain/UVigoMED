{"id":9017,"title":"MiR-330-mediated regulation of SH3GL2 expression enhances malignant behaviors of glioblastoma stem cells by activating ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.","abstract":"MicroRNAs are currently considered as an active and rapidly evolving area for the treatment of tumors. In this study, we elucidated the biological significance of miR-330 in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) as well as the possible molecular mechanisms. SH3GL2 is mainly distributed in the central nervous system and considered to be a tumor suppressor in many tumors. In the present study, we identified miR-330 as a potential regulator of SH3GL2 and we found that it was to be inversely correlated with SH3GL2 expression in GSCs which were isolated from U87 cell lines. The expression of miR-330 enhanced cellular proliferation, promoted cell migration and invasion, and dampened cell apoptosis. When the GSCs were co-transfected with the plasmid containing short hairpin RNA directed against human SH3GL2 gene and miR-330 mimic, we found that miR-330 promoted the malignant behavior of GSCs by down-regulating the expression of SH3GL2. Meanwhile, the ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were significantly activated, leading to the decreased expression of apoptotic protein and increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein. Furthermore, in orthotopic mouse xenografts, the mice given stable over-expressed SH3GL2 cells co-transfected with miR-330 knockdown plasmid had the smallest tumor sizes and longest survival. In conclusion, these results suggested that miR-330 negatively regulated the expression of SH3GL2 in GSCs, which promoted the oncogenic progression of GSCs through activating ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The elucidation of these mechanisms will provide potential therapeutic approaches for human glioblastoma.
