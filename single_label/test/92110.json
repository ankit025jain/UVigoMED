{"id":92110,"title":"Epidemiology of traumatic spinal cord injuries in The Netherlands in 2010.","abstract":"Retrospective files study.To update epidemiological data on the incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) in The Netherlands.The Netherlands.From the Dutch National acute-care hospital database, all records of patients discharged with International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes 806 or 952 in 2010 were selected. For each record, we requested an anonymised copy of the hospital discharge letter. We analysed the received letters for TSCI, defined as a newly acquired traumatic transverse lesion of the spinal cord or cauda equina, resulting in loss of motor, sensory, bladder or bowel function below the level of the lesion, lasting longer than 2 weeks. We further extracted data on demographic and SCI characteristics and discharge destination.We received 372 discharge letters or a confirmation that the patient did not have TSCI. A total of 185 patients with TSCI were identified, of whom 30 died during acute-care hospital stay. We estimated the incidence of TSCI as 14.0 per million per annum including patients and 11.7 per million per annum excluding patients who did not survive the acute phase. Most patients were male (74%), had tetraplegia (69%) and an motor incomplete lesion (62%). Median age was 62 years (range 13-96). Discharge destination was a rehabilitation centre specialized in SCI in 78% of patients with motor complete TSCI and 47% of patients with motor incomplete TSCI.The estimated incidence of TSCI surviving the acute phase was 11.7 per million per annum in the Netherlands in 2010. A substantial proportion of these patients was not referred to a specialized rehabilitation centre.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and
