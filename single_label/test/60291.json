{"id":60291,"title":"Treatment of chronic upper limb ischaemia is safe and results are good.","abstract":"Chronic ischaemia of the upper extremity is rare, and only a few small studies are published on results after revascularisation. We found it of interest to present this larger population-based registry-study of patients treated for chronic ischaemia of the upper limb by open or endovascular procedures.A total of 101,725 primary arterial vascular procedures in the Danish National Vascular Registry (Karbase) were recorded from 1.1.1993 to 31.12.2011. Of these, a total of 453 (0.4%) procedures were performed for chronic stenotic disease of the proximal arteries of the upper limb, 233 endovascularly and 220 by open surgery.Open reconstructions: Two patients died within 30 days, which is equivalent to a mortality rate of 0.9%. Six (2.7%) reconstructions occluded before discharge. Complications were observed in 41 patients (19%); the complications were predominantly related to surgical wound. At follow-up, 74 (70%) had no symptoms. Endovascular reconstructions: There were six deaths within the first 30 days, which is equivalent to an early mortality rate of 2.6%. Four (2%) reconstructions occluded before discharge. Complications were observed for 23 (10%) patients; the complications were predominantly of neurovascular origin. At follow-up, 90 (74%) had no symptoms. The one-year survival was 95% with no difference between the two groups.Chronic ischaemia of the upper limb can be treated both with open surgery and endovascularly with acceptable results. There was an excellent one-year patency rate for the patients who showed up for follow-up; the patency rate was comparable to that reported in the literature.not relevant.not relevant.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947629","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.580975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.526749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.388253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.162869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.0724204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0595559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"}]}
