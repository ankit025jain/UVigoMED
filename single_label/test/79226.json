{"id":79226,"title":"Flexible integration of laser myringotomy and ventilation tube for bilateral Otitis media with effusion: analysis of laser tympanostomy versus ventilation tube.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of laser myringotomy (LM) compared to ventilation tube (VT), and to assess the clinical success criteria of LM-assisted VT insertion as the flexible alternatives avoiding GA for the treatment of bilateral consistent otitis media with effusion (OME).LM under topical anesthesia was followed by VT insertion in cooperative children using AcuspotÂ® 712 CO2 laser micromanipulator attached microscope. Sixty children failed VT and bilateral laser tympanostomy was done (group LL), and 130 children tolerated VT on one side but LM on the other side (group LV). The efficacy of LM was compared to VT regarding recurrent effusion and reoperation as the outcome measure; firstly, by ear-to-ear matched pair analysis in LV, and secondly between LL vs. LV. Long-term outcome was compared to control group who received both VT under GA (group GAVT) regarding the outcome of additional VT and GA.The effectiveness of LM per ear was equivocal as 46.9% and 40.8% in LV and LL respectively; but the effectiveness per children was further lower in LL as 28.3%, which was a limitation of LM for bilateral OME. LL required reoperation in 71.7% mostly requiring impending GA in 51.7% within 4.7 months, thus was a controversial treatment. But LV required GA in 20.8% during the 27.2 months long-term follow-up, which was second set of VT and adenoidectomy that were also comparably required in GAVT control with multiple GA.Standard GAVT was more recommended for bilateral OME than bilateral LM (LL) in our practice. But LM was selectively effective for some children, that combined approach with LM plus VT provided comparable period to outgrow OME as effectively as GAVT, when LM was supplemented with one VT side with recovered hearing.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465456","annotations":[{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Topical anesthetic","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_anesthetic"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.672213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Adenoidectomy","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoidectomy"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Myringotomy","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myringotomy"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Micromanipulator","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanipulator"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Latvia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia"},{"name":"Equivocation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Vermont","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont"},{"name":"712","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/712"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Apollo Lunar Module","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide laser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Mexican Imperial Orders","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Imperial_Orders"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"}]}
