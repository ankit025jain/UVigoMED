{"id":24352,"title":"Effects of tofacitinib on lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis: relation to efficacy and infectious adverse events.","abstract":"To assess the effects of tofacitinib on T lymphocytes in RA patients with a special focus on efficacy and infectious adverse events (iAEs).Forty-four RA patients participated in 12-month phase II/III randomized clinical trials and an open-label extension trial. Peripheral lymphocyte subsets and in vitro CD4(+) T lymphocyte proliferation were measured in 23 patients of 44 at baseline and at the end of the 12-month trial.Forty-four patients [35 females, age 54.3 years, disease duration 84.3 months, simplified disease activity index (SDAI) 36.5, CRP 24.9 mg/l, ESR 53 mm/h, MMP-3 284 pg/ml, RF 172.6 IU/ml, neutrophil count 4842 per ?l, lymphocyte count 1410 per ?l] were treated with tofacitinib. At the end of the study, the SDAI improved to 6.2, but the peripheral lymphocyte count and absolute numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) subpopulations did not change during this period. However, CD4(+) T lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed, which correlated with the improvement in SDAI, but not with iAEs (n = 19) during the 12-month treatment. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a CD8(+) T lymphocyte count ? 211 per ?l at baseline as a significant predictor of clinically significant iAEs.The efficacy of tofacitinib is mediated through the suppression of CD4(+) T lymphocyte proliferation without affecting the absolute number of these cells in the periphery. A low CD8(+) T cell count at baseline correlated with the development of iAEs during the treatment of RA patients.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441153","annotations":[{"name":"T cell","weight":0.899663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.888726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.830534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.751748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.553128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.288693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Tofacitinib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofacitinib"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
