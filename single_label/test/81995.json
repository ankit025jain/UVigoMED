{"id":81995,"title":"The relative proportions of different lipid classes and their fatty acid compositions change with culture age in the cariogenic dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans UA159.","abstract":"The oral cariogenic bacterial pathogen Streptococcus mutans strain UA159 has become an important research organism strain since its genome was sequenced. However, there is a paucity of information on its lipidome using direct analytical biochemical approaches. We here report on comprehensive analyses of the major lipid classes and their fatty acids in cells grown in batch standing cultures. Using 2-D high-performance thin-layer chromatography lipid class composition changes were detected with culture age. More lipid components were detected in the stationary-phase compared to log-phase cells. The major lipids identified included 1,3-bis(sn-3'-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol (phosphatidylglycerol), 1,3-diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), aminoacyl-phosphatidylglycerol, monoglucosyldiacylglycerol, diglucosyldiacylglycerol, diglucosylmonoacylglycerol and, glycerophosphoryldiglucosyldiacylglycerol. Culture age also affected the fatty acid composition of the total polar lipid fraction. Thus, the major lipid classes detected in log-phase and stationary-phase cells were isolated and their fatty acids were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography to determine the basis for the fatty acid compositional changes in the total polar lipid fraction. The analyses showed that the relative proportions of these acids changed with culture age within individual lipid classes. Hence fatty acid changes in the total polar lipid fraction reflected changes in both lipid class composition and fatty acid compositions within individual lipid classes.
