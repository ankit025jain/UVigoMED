{"id":30379,"title":"Self-compassion and risk behavior among people living with HIV/AIDS.","abstract":"Sexual risk behavior and illicit drug use among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) contribute to poor health and onward transmission of HIV. The aim of this collaborative multi-site nursing research study was to explore the association between self-compassion and risk behaviors in PLWHA. As part of a larger project, nurse researchers in Canada, China, Namibia, Puerto Rico, Thailand and the US enrolled 1211 sexually active PLWHA using convenience sampling. The majority of the sample was male, middle-aged, and from the US. Illicit drug use was strongly associated with sexual risk behavior, but participants with higher self-compassion were less likely to report sexual risk behavior, even in the presence of illicit drug use. Self-compassion may be a novel area for behavioral intervention development for PLWHA.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510757","annotations":[{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.827927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.774928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.540434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.374059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Namibia","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.121905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"HIV-positive people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-positive_people"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Criminal transmission of HIV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_transmission_of_HIV"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Recklessness (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_(psychology)"}]}
