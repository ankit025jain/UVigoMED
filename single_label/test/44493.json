{"id":44493,"title":"Management of bleeding gastric varices: a single session of histoacryl injection may be sufficient.","abstract":"Gastric variceal bleeding is one of the most feared complications of portal hypertension and hence merits investigation for its optimal therapy. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and long-term outcome(s) of patients treated with a single session of histoacryl sclerotherapy for active gastric variceal bleeding.The medical records of patients who presented with active gastric variceal bleeding between 1998 and 2011 in a tertiary care setting were evaluated retrospectively and the eventual outcome(s) (initial hemostasis, rebleeding, and mortality rate) was assessed at least 1 year after the index bleed.Ninety-seven patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 51.0 Â± 12.5 years; 62% were men. Hepatitis C was the most common etiology, found in 63 (65%) patients. The majority of the patients were classified as Child-Pugh grade B and C: 44 (46%) and 29 (31%) patients, respectively. A total of 40 (41%) patients were IGV1, 35 (36%) patients were GOV 2, 20 (21%) patients were GOV 1, and 2 (2%) patients were IGV2. A single session of histoacryl was successful in controlling bleeding in 83 (86%) patients. Seven (7%) patients died during the hospital stay. Rebleeding was observed in 24 (27%) patients during the 1-year follow-up, of whom 12 (50%) were managed successfully with repeated histoacryl injection. The overall mortality rate at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year was 14 (14%), 19 (20%) and 26 (27%) patients, respectively. Child-Pugh classification was a significant prognostic factor of survival (P<0.001).A single session of histoacryl sclerotherapy is effective in the majority of patients with active gastric variceal bleeding. Rebleeding was observed in one-fourth of patients, half of whom were controlled successfully by repeated histoacryl sclerotherapy.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732750","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.832147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.732378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.688483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.622669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Gastric varices","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_varices"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0937041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
