{"id":38799,"title":"Management of arrhythmias in patients with a tetralogy of Fallot.","abstract":"Although arrhythmias are commonly found in patients with all different types of congenital heart disease, perhaps no patient is at higher risk of late development of arrhythmias that may result in sudden death than in the patient following tetralogy of Fallot repair. Despite major improvement in the surgical repair of this disease, a significant percentage of these patients continue to remain at risk for the late development of arrhythmias, and a small percentage will develop life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. Which patients remain at highest risk is still not clearly delineated. Diligent arrhythmia surveillance and aggressive treatment strategies are necessary to minimise this risk. This article highlights important strategies to manage arrhythmia development and prevention in this patient population.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401263","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.801314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.634573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tetralogy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
