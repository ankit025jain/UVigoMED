{"id":64894,"title":"[Use of Xanthii spinosi herba in treatment of benign prostate hypertrophia].","abstract":"The aim of our study was to asses the efficacy of Xanthii spinosi herba in the treatment of rats with benign prostate hypertrophia induced under experimental conditions. Benign prostate hypertrophia (BPH) was induced by per oral (p.o.) administration of testosterone undecanoate (40 mg Undestor capsules) in concentrations of 15 mg/ kg/day and 35 mg/ kg/day. Drug induced BPH was treated with Xanthii spinosi herba as infusion and tincture. Drug induced benign prostate hyperplasia in rats was accompanied by a series of physical changes, like weight increase and shinier fur, and also by behavioral changes (increased appetite, aggression, increased libido). Prostate size was higher in all groups of animals treated with testosterone undecanoate compared to the control group. The morphopathological study of the organs taken from slaughtered animals, showed some microscopic changes in the prostate. In animals treated with Xanthii spinosi herba (infusion and tincture) we observed a decrease in volume of the prostate, while the microscopic changes were absent.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167701","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Libido","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.731496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.503148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.391924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.334943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.176201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Fur","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur"},{"name":"Polyphagia","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphagia"},{"name":"Testosterone undecanoate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone_undecanoate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Donkey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
