{"id":22337,"title":"H. pylori infection, inflammation and gastric cancer.","abstract":"A strong association between chronic infection, inflammation, and cancer has been suggested.Helicobacter pylori, a microaerophilic gram negative bacterium, infects about half the world's population. It has been defined as a definitive carcinogen in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. H. pylori evades the host immune responses and persists in the stomach leading to gastritis gastric atrophy and sometimes gastric cancer.Chronic H. pylori infection causes gastric cancer via two mechanisms: the presence of virulence factors and the induction of chronic inflammation which ultimately leads to neoplastic transformation.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557546","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Microaerophile","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaerophile"},{"name":"Gram-negative bacteria","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.299158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
