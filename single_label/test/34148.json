{"id":34148,"title":"Percutaneous femoral derotational osteotomy for excessive femoral torsion.","abstract":"Femoral derotational osteotomy is an acceptable treatment for excessive femoral torsion. The described procedure is a minimally invasive single-incision technique based on an intramedullary saw that enables an inside-out osteotomy, preserving the periosteum and biological activity in the local bone and soft tissue. After the osteotomy is complete and correction is achieved, an expandable intramedullary nail is used to achieve immediate stability, without the need for locking screws. Indications, tips, and pitfalls related to this novel osteotomy technique are discussed.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762832","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.540272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.515183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.280357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.222222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Indication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"}]}
