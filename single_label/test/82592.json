{"id":82592,"title":"Oral tissue irritants in toothpaste: a case report.","abstract":"In this case, an adolescent patient presented with multiple, asymptomatic ulcerated lesions- resembling aphthous ulcerations- located in the oral cavity. The etiology of these lesions appeared to be associated with soft tissue irritants found in the patient's toothpaste. This report highlights the need to rule out known oral irritants in dentifrices for patients who present with oral ulcerations.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579288","annotations":[{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Aphthous ulcer","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_ulcer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.651863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.635017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.482862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.334399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.306439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
