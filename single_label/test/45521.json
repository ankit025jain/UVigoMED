{"id":45521,"title":"Colorectal ESD: current indications and latest technical advances.","abstract":"The number of medical facilities that perform colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been growing, and its effectiveness has been increasingly reported in recent years. Indications approved by the Japanese government's medical insurance system are early colorectal cancers with a maximum tumor size of 2-5Â cm. ESD was an effective procedure for treating noninvasive colorectal tumors difficult to resect en bloc by conventional EMR, resulting in a higher en bloc resection rate that is less invasive than surgery. Based on the excellent clinical results of colorectal ESDs, the Japanese health care insurance system has approved colorectal ESD for coverage.
