{"id":55467,"title":"Femtosecond laser-assisted MyoRing implantation in postoperative LASIK ectasia.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of MyoRing implantations (DIOPTEX GmbH, Linz, Austria) in patients with ectasia after LASIK.MyoRing implantation was performed in 15 eyes of 14 patients with ectasia after LASIK using a femtosecond laser. Uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, refraction, keratometry, central corneal thickness, corneal biomechanical profile, and corneal aberrometry were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively.Uncorrected distance visual acuity (1.02 ± 0.48 to 0.30 ± 0.18 logMAR), maximum keratometry (50.14 ± 1.82 to 43.80 ± 1.21 diopters), and sphere (-4.4 ± 4.8 to +1.50 ± 0.61 diopters) were significantly improved from preoperative values at 1 month after surgery with no significant change afterward. Corrected distance visual acuity did not improve significantly 1 month after implantation, but between the 1- and 3-month follow-up visits, a significant improvement (0.30 ± 0.1 to 0.17 ± 0.13 logMAR) was observed without any additional improvement thereafter. A nearly significant (P = .05) increase in central corneal thickness (439.4 ± 19 to 452.2 ± 20 ?m) was observed during the 1-month postoperative period. Primary coma, higher-order aberrations, and trefoil showed an insignificant decrease 1 month after surgery and afterward. Spherical aberration significantly increased between the preoperative visit and the first postoperative visit. Corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor showed no significant change between visits.MyoRing is a safe and effective method in patients with ectasia after LASIK. It can improve corrected distance visual acuity and reduce refractive error in these patients.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877554","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.839264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Spherical aberration","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Keratometer","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratometer"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.710022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.561344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Trefoil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil"},{"name":"Linz","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linz"},{"name":"Hysteresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"GmbH","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GmbH"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"Cyborg","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg"}]}
