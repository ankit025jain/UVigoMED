{"id":11223,"title":"Isoproterenol?mediated heme oxygenase?1 induction inhibits high mobility group box 1 protein release and protects against rat myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo.","abstract":"Isoproterenol (ISO) has been reported to inhibit high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein release via heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 cells and increase the survival rate of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic mice. Therefore, it was examined whether ISO-mediated HO-1 induction inhibits HMGB1 release in cardiac myocytes and attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Anesthetized male rats were pretreated with ISO [intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/kg] prior to ischemia in the absence and/or presence of zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX, i.p., 10 mg/kg), which is an inhibitor of HO-1, and then subjected to ischemia for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h. The myocardial I/R injury and oxidative stress were assessed. In addition, the HO-1 protein and HMGB1 expression were measured by western blot analysis. ISO significantly attenuated the myocardial I/R injury, reduced oxidative stress, and induced HO-1 and reduced HMGB1 release. However, all these effects caused by ISO were significantly reversed in the presence of ZnPPIX. These results suggested that ISO has a pivotal role in the protective effects on myocardial I/R injury. This protection mechanism is possibly due to the inhibition of HMGB1 release via the induction of HO-1.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604346","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.948051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Heme","weight":0.856791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.742124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.442143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.275049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Porphyrin","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrin"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Isoprenaline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprenaline"},{"name":"Heme oxygenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme_oxygenase"},{"name":"HMGB1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGB1"},{"name":"DNA ligase","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_ligase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"International Organization for Standardization","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Factor IX","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_IX"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Oxygenase","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenase"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
