{"id":52734,"title":"Paclitaxel-exposed ovarian cancer cells induce cancer?specific CD4+ T cells after doxorubicin exposure through regulation of MyD88 expression.","abstract":"Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecological malignancies due to high chemoresistance to the combination of platinum with taxane. Immunotherapy against ovarian cancer is a promising strategy to develop from animal-based cancer research. We investigated changes in the immunogenicity of paclitaxel-exposed ovarian cancer cells following exposure to other chemotherapeutic drugs. Murine ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) showed some resistance to paclitaxel, a first-line therapy for ovarian cancer. However, MOSECs pre-exposed to paclitaxel died through apoptosis after incubation with doxorubicin or cisplatin for 2 h. Injected into mice, the paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs post-treated with doxorubicin induced more MOSEC-specific CD4(+) T cells and extended survival for a greater time than MOSECs treated with paclitaxel alone; and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and produced IL-12 after co-culture with paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin. We also observed that in paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin, but not cisplatin, the expression of MyD88 and related target proteins decreased compared to paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs only, while in BMDCs co-cultured with these MOSECs the expression of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) increased. These findings suggest that paclitaxel pre-exposed cancer cells treated with doxorubicin can induce significant apoptosis and a therapeutic antitumor immune response in advanced ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573741","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.848602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.815524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.76687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.741807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.71915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.625164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.381682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.359398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.164629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
