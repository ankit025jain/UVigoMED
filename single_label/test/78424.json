{"id":78424,"title":"The effects of endoscopic sinus surgery on the postoperative outcomes of open rhinoplasty.","abstract":"Several studies have advocated concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery and rhinoplasty. However, concerns about increased surgical risk, complications, and unsuccessful cosmetic outcomes following the concurrent procedures have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the overall safety of concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery and rhinoplasty and to specifically examine the effect of endoscopic sinus surgery on cosmetic outcomes.We retrospectively reviewed 57 patients who underwent concurrent open rhinoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We then selected a control group of patients, who underwent rhinoplasty only and were matched with a study group for age, sex, external nose deformity, and implant graft material. The postoperative outcomes of the 2 groups were compared.Fifty-seven patients underwent concurrent open rhinoplasty and ESS. Postoperative assessment showed that a successful outcome was achieved in 82.5% of the patients who underwent concurrent procedures and in 87.7% of the patients who underwent rhinoplasty only (P = .56). The rate of revision due to a dissatisfied outcome was 5 patients (8.7%) in the concurrent surgery group and 3 patients (5.3%) in the rhinoplasty-only group (P = .36). Minor complications occurred in 6 patients (10.5%) from the group who underwent the concurrent procedures and 5 patients (8.8%) from the rhinoplasty-only group (P = .76).Combined rhinoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery achieves a similar aesthetic outcome to rhinoplasty only, with no significant increase in rates of revision or complication.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671479","annotations":[{"name":"Rhinoplasty","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.567881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.358198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.247559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.0656689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
