{"id":51770,"title":"Hypopituitarism in a neonate with hyperbilirubinemia and decreased level of consciousness: a case report study.","abstract":"Decreased level of consciousness in neonates may result from different etiologies, including rare metabolic and hormonal disorder due to anterior pituitary insufficiency. In this case report, a five-day-old newborn boy was referred to the neonatal intensive care unit of Mustafa Khomeini hospital of Ilam, Iran. He had an open anterior fontanel with no history of prenatal and familial diseases. Clinical examination showed decreased level of consciousness so that this patient responded only to painful stimuli. Furthermore, unconsciousness, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypotonia were fully evident. Given the clinical findings and decreased level of consciousness, hormonal diagnostic tests and brain CT scan were performed for any evidence of hypopituitarism. Clinical and experimental findings were consistent with the generalized edema and pituitary insufficiency secondary to central hypothyroidism and cortisol deficiency. Based on the findings, the neonate was put on the hormonal replacement therapy and, as the result, all of the abnormal clinical symptoms disappeared. In conclusion, fatal neonatal diseases may be mistaken with unimportant clinical findings at the first examination. Therefore, comprehensive attention to all potential causes of such symptoms in the neonates should be given for early diagnosis and treatment, and to prevent any fatal and irreversible complications.
