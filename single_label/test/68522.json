{"id":68522,"title":"Porphyrin conjugated with serum albumins and monoclonal antibodies boosts efficiency in targeted destruction of human bladder cancer cells.","abstract":"The synthesis of a novel PS conjugated with bovine and human serum albumin (BSA and HSA) and a monoclonal antibody anti-CD104 is reported, as well as their biological potential against the human bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3. No photodynamic effect was detected when the non-conjugated porphyrin was used. Yet, when it was coupled covalently with the mAb anti-CD104, BSA and HSA, the resulting photosensitizer conjugates demonstrated high efficacy in destroying the cancer cells, the mAb anti-CD104 efficacy overruling the albumins.
