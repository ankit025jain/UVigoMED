{"id":89222,"title":"Transarticular approach and retrograde plate osteosynthesis (TARPO) using implants with angular stability -- a series of 17 cases of complex distal femoral fractures type C3/AO.","abstract":"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the outcome of distal femoral fractures type C3 AO, using TARPO technique and plates with angular stability.The study included 17 fractures type C3 AO, with 4 open fractures: 1 type I, 1 type II, and 2 type IIIA with bone loss Gustilo. All patients were operated by TARPO technique using Less Invasive Stabilization System-LISS (4 cases), Locked Compression Plates-LCP (8 cases) and plates with polyaxial stability (5 cases). The excellent stability of the construct allowed fast knee rehabilitation. The follow-up period included at least 12 months.15 fractures healed within a mean time of 12.6 weeks,while 2 cases with open fractures and bone loss required secondary bone grafting. We recorded no infection or implant failures. The outcome using Neer scale was excellent in 9 cases and satisfactory in 7 cases (1 patient with discontinued follow-up).This demanding TARPO technique has the advantage of a faster rate of union and improved exposure of the knee joint. The locked plates provide a unique alternative in distal femoral fractures type C3 AO, as well as in osteoporotic and open fractures.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742416","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.735628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.717274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.648184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.227283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.138079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Coccyx","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccyx"},{"name":"Holotype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"AC power plugs and sockets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Neer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neer"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"}]}
