{"id":11133,"title":"Structural studies of the lipopolysaccharide from the fish pathogen Aeromonas veronii strain Bs19, serotype O16.","abstract":"Chemical analyses, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy were applied to study the structure of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from Aeromonas veronii strain Bs19, serotype O16. ESI-MS revealed that the most abundant LPS glycoforms have tetra-acylated or hexa-acylated lipid A species, consisting of a bisphosphorylated GlcN disaccharide with an AraN residue as a non-stoichiometric substituent, and a core oligosaccharide composed of Hep?Hex?HexN?Kdo?P?. Sugar and methylation analysis together with 1D and 2D ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy were the main methods used, and revealed that the O-specific polysaccharide (OPS) of A. veronii Bs19 was built up of tetrasaccharide repeating units with the structure: ?4)-?-D-Quip3NAc-(1?3)-?-L-Rhap-(1?4)-?-D-Galp-(1?3)-?-D-GalpNAc-(1?. This composition was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The charge-deconvoluted ESI FT-ICR MS recorded for the LPS preparations identified mass peaks of SR- and R-form LPS species, that differed by ?m = 698.27 u, a value corresponding to the calculated molecular mass of one OPS repeating unit (6dHexNAc6dHexHexHexNAc-H?O). Moreover, unspecific fragmentation spectra confirmed the sequence of the sugar residues in the OPS and allowed to assume that the elucidated structure also represented the biological repeating unit.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Animal
