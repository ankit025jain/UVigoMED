{"id":55959,"title":"Identification of a GJA3 mutation in a Chinese family with congenital nuclear cataract using exome sequencing.","abstract":"Congenital cataract, a clinically and genetically heterogeneous lens disorder is defined as any opacity of the lens presented from birth and is responsible for approximately 10% of worldwide childhood poor vision or blindness. To identify the genetic defect responsible for congenital nuclear cataract in a four-generation Chinese Han family, exome and direct Sanger sequencings were conducted and a missense variant c.139G>A (p.D47N) in the gap junction protein-alpha 3 gene (GJA3) was identified. The variant co-segregated with patients of the family and was not observed in unaffected family members or normal controls. The above findings indicated that the variant was a pathogenic mutation. The mutation p.D47N was found in the first extracellular loop (El) domain of GJA3 protein. Our data suggest that exome sequencing is a powerful tool to discover mutation(s) in cataract, a disorder with high genetic heterogeneity. Our findings may also provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of congenital nuclear cataract and have implications for genetic counseling.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772942","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.755723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.641132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.370915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.213206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"China","weight":0.190815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.166395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.128522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Gap junction","weight":0.118284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0804089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
