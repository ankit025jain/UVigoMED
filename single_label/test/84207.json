{"id":84207,"title":"Optimal approach to the management of intrathoracic esophageal leak following esophagectomy: a systematic review.","abstract":"Recently, endoscopic interventions (eg, esophageal stenting) have been successfully used for the management of intrathoracic leak. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the safety and efficacy of techniques used in the management of intrathoracic anastomotic leak.We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed to identify eligible studies analyzing management of intrathoracic esophageal leak following esophagectomy.Intraoperative anastomotic drain placement was associated with earlier identification and resolution of anastomotic leak (mean 23.4 vs 80.7 days). In addition, reinforcement of the anastomosis with omentoplasty may reduce the incidence of anastomotic leak by nearly 50%. Endoscopic stent placement was associated with leak resolution in 72%; fatal complications were reported, however, and safety remains to be proven. Negative pressure therapy, a potentially useful tool, requires further study. If stenting and wound vacuum are used, undrained mediastinal contamination and persistent leak require surgical intervention.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25151186","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.874721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.812907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.771356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.741125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.287108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"}]}
