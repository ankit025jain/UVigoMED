{"id":75795,"title":"Cognitive function, behavioral problems, and physical function in long-term care insurance beneficiaries with dementia in South Korea: comparison of home care and institutional care services.","abstract":"To examine, in beneficiaries with long-term care (LTC) insurance (LTCI) with dementia in Korea, changes in cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, and physical function over time in relation to LTCI service type and to determine the 2-year effects of service type on those health outcomes.Secondary analyses of the existing LTCI data set from 2008 to 2010.South Korea.LTCI beneficiaries with dementia aged 65 and older (N=31,319). Participants were divided according to the service type that they were receiving home care (HC), institutional care (IC), and combined care (CC).A LTC approval checklist was used to determine the level of LTCI coverage of each participant and to assess cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, and physical function. Linear mixed models and multiple regression models were used.There were significant differences in cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, and physical function at baseline between individuals receiving the three service types (P<.001) and overall improvements in those outcomes over 2 years in the three groups (P<.001). After limiting the sample to those who had received LTCI services for the full 2 years (2008-2010) and adjusting for baseline characteristics, individuals receiving HC were more likely to have better cognitive and physical function than those receiving IC or CC but were likely to have more behavioral symptoms 2 years after the LTCI enrollment (P<.001).LTCI service type (HC, IC, CC) predicted cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, and physical function at 2-year follow-up in beneficiaries with dementia. Further research is necessary to examine the effect of LTC services on health outcomes in a longer observational cohort.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041583","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.654854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.59483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.388404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.370748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Multilevel model","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Lieutenant Colonel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Checklist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0168556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Beneficiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary"}]}
