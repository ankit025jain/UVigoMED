{"id":80799,"title":"N¹,N¹-Dimethyl-N³-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenethyl)propane-1,3-diamine, a new lead for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis.","abstract":"The natural product, convolutamine I (1), has anti-trypanosomal activity however it has a high molecular weight of 473 due to a presence of 3 bromine atoms. The synthesis of the natural product convolutamine I (1) together with its analogues are presented. A SAR study against Trypanosoma brucei brucei led to compounds with improved physico-chemical properties: lower molecular weight and lower log P while maintaining potency (with a slight 2-fold improvement).
