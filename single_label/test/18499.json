{"id":18499,"title":"Antifungal drug development: challenges, unmet clinical needs, and new approaches.","abstract":"Invasive, life-threatening fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly for patients with compromised immune function. The number of therapeutic options for the treatment of invasive fungal infections is quite limited when compared with those available to treat bacterial infections. Indeed, only three classes of molecules are currently used in clinical practice and only one new class of antifungal drugs has been developed in the last 30 years. Here we summarize the unmet clinical needs of current antifungal therapy, discuss challenges inherent to antifungal drug discovery and development, and review recent developments aimed at addressing some of these challenges.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789878","annotations":[{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.776875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Drug discovery","weight":0.772901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.738704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.640291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.449421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.420135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"}]}
