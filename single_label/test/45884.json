{"id":45884,"title":"Angiogenesis in cancer - general pathways and their therapeutic implications.","abstract":"A vast amount of data shows that angiogenesis has a pivotal role in tumor growth, progression, invasiveness and metastasis. This is a complex process involving essential signaling pathways such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Notch in vasculature, as well as additional players such as bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells. Primary tumor cells, stromal cells and cancer stem cells strongly influence vessel growth in tumors. Better understanding of the role of the different pathways and the crosstalk between different cells during tumor angiogenesis are crucial factors for developing more effective anticancer therapies. Targeting angiogenic factors from the VEGF family has become an effective strategy to inhibit tumor growth and so far the most successful results are seen in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLL). Despite the initial enthusiasm, the angiogenesis inhibitors showed only moderate survival benefit as monotherapy, along with a high cost and many side effects. Obviously, other important pathways may affect the angiogenic switch, among them Notch signaling pathway attracted a large interest because its ubiquitous role in carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Herein we present the basics for VEGF and Notch signaling pathways and current advances of targeting them in antiangiogenic, antitumor therapy.
