{"id":89586,"title":"Cortical hypoexcitability persists beyond the symptomatic phase of a concussion.","abstract":"The purpose of this research was to assess cortical excitability, voluntary activation of muscle and force sensation beyond the initial highly symptomatic period post-concussion (1-4 weeks post-injury). It was hypothesized that reduced excitability of the motor cortex may impair muscle activation and alter perceptions of force and effort.Eight concussed varsity football players were age- and position-matched with eight healthy teammates to control for training and body size. Healthy controls had not suffered a concussion in the previous 12 months.Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess cortical excitability, voluntary activation was calculated using cortical twitch interpolation technique and sense of force was determined using constant-force sensation contractions.The concussed group had lower intra-cortical facilitation (p?=?0.036), lower maximal voluntary muscle activation (p?=?0.038) and greater perceptions of force (p?<?0.05), likely due to compensatory increases in upstream drive, than their healthy matched teammates.Taken together, these findings suggest a state of hypoexcitability that persists beyond the immediate acute phase of a concussion and may result in neuromuscular impairments that would call to question the athlete's readiness to return to sport.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702432","annotations":[{"name":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation","weight":0.906532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.761355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Motor cortex","weight":0.722028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.613322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.322178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.293177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.228847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Neocortex","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.114344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.0703685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0458912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Somatic nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Varsity team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_team"},{"name":"Taken (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Transcranial doppler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_doppler"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Compensatory damages","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensatory_damages"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"American football","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football"},{"name":"Interpolation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"}]}
