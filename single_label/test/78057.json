{"id":78057,"title":"[Analysis of epitympanic/antrum cholesteatoma excised by endoscopy and microscope].","abstract":"Comparison of operation of epitympanic/antrum cholesteatoma excised by endoscopy and microscope.Eleven patients with epitympanic/antrum cholesteatoma were analysed, 5 cases were excised by endoscopy and 6 cases were excised under microscope.No complication occurred after operation and all patients got dried ear. There were no difference in hearing recovery and closure of perforation of tympanic membrane between two group. The operation time, injury degree, length of stay in hospital and hospitalization expense with endoscopy was superior to that of microscope.Considering financial constraints of patients, resection of epitympanic/antrum cholesteatoma cholesteatoma can be adopted by endoscopy.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800545","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.623617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.613683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.459079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.425307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.121231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.114562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Tensor tympani muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
