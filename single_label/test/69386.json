{"id":69386,"title":"High prevalence and risk factors for kidney dysfunction in patients with atherosclerotic cardio-cerebrovascular disease.","abstract":"Patients with atherosclerotic cardio-cerebrovascular disease are at high risk of kidney dysfunction because of the overlap of several risk factors. The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence and characteristics and risk factors for kidney dysfunction in the cardio-cerebrovascular disease population.Renal functions of 1012 patients with the cardio-cerebrovascular disease were evaluated with the purpose of evaluating characteristics of the incidence, risk factors for kidney dysfunction in the cardio-cerebrovascular disease population.In the univariate analysis, the major risk factors for kidney dysfunction in the patients with the cardio-cerebrovascular disease were age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and serum uric acid. In the patients with both hypertension and diabetes mellitus the percentages of significantly decreased eGFR were 25.6%. Results of multivariable analysis showed that diabetes mellitus (odds ratio (OR) 1.609, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.08-2.398, P = 0.019), hypertension (OR 1.547, 95% CI 1.049-2.281, P = 0.028) and serum uric acid (OR 1.009, 95% CI 1.007-1.010, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for reduced kidney function.In the context of the cardio-cerebrovascular disease kidney dysfunction is common and has a high prevalence. Patients with both cardio-cerebrovascular disease and kidney dysfunction at any stage should be recognized as high-risk population.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448380","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.809068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.740683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.728461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.717747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.674708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.588116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.567881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.514084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.14988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"398","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/398"},{"name":"1012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1012"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
