{"id":69501,"title":"Steroids for surgery during cardiopulmonary bypass in adults: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of steroid administration on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, renal insufficiency, death, intensive care (ICU) length of stay (LOS) and hospital LOS of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Meta-analysis of parallel randomized controlled trials.University hospital.A search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE(R) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials of studies on adults undergoing surgery with CPB who received steroid administration. Effect size (risk ratio or mean difference) for MI, stroke, renal insufficiency, death, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS were evaluated.48 RCTs published between 1977 and 2012 were retained for analysis. Steroids had no effect on the MI risk ratio (RR) 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63, 1.32); death at 30 days RR 0.84 (0.59, 1.20); stroke RR 0.92 (0.60, 1.42) or renal insufficiency RR 0.83 (0.52, 1.32). Administration of steroids reduced ICU LOS (P = 0.00001; I(2) 87.5%) and hospital LOS (P = 0.03; I(2) 81.1%). Metaregressions showed that duration of steroid administration was correlated with the reduction in ICU LOS (P = 0.0004) and hospital LOS (P < 0.00001).Increasing the duration of steroid administration may reduce ICU and hospital LOS greater than increasing the dose.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439905","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.742865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.685924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.650183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.632776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.627932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.592282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.574392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.574101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.316381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.113497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
