{"id":22307,"title":"Synovial IL-6 as inflammatory marker in periprosthetic joint infections.","abstract":"We analyzed serum and synovial biomarkers of 69 patients. 31 of them suffered from a periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) and 38 from aseptic arthralgia after total joint arthroplasty. We used Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-curves to calculate the Area-under-the-curve (AUC), cutoff-values, positive (+LR), negative (-LR) and interval-Likelihood-Ratios (iLR) for predicting a PJI. The most significant parameter was synovial interleukin-6 (IL-6) (cutoff-value ? 30,750 pg/ml, AUC = 0.959, SE = 90.0%, SP = 94.7%, +LR = 17.27), followed by synovial lactate (cutoff-value ? 8.3 mmol/l, AUC = 0.844, SE = 71.4%, SP=88.0%, +LR = 5.95), and synovial glucose (cutoff-value ? 44 mg/dl, AUC = 0.829, SE = 79.2%, SP = 78.6%, +LR = 3.69). IL-6 ? 30,750 pg/ml and lactate ? 10 mmol/l make a PJI very likely, IL-6 <10,000pg/ml or lactate <4.3 mmol/l makes a PJI very unlikely. If none of these thresholds are met, physicians should use the iLR of IL-6, glucose and lactate to estimate the likelihood of PJI.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559521","annotations":[{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.939184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.444711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.36771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.22199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"844","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/844"},{"name":"829","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/829"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
