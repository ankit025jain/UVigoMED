{"id":50638,"title":"Sorafenib in radioactive iodine-refractory, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.","abstract":"Patients with radioactive iodine ((131)I)-refractory locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer have a poor prognosis because of the absence of effective treatment options. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of orally administered sorafenib in the treatment of patients with this type of cancer.Patients were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to sorafenib or placebo. The intention-to-treat population comprised 417 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 210 in the placebo group) and the safety population was 416 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 209 in the placebo group). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sorafenib group (10·8 months) than in the placebo group (5·8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·45-0·76; p<0·0001). Progression-free survival improved in all prespecified clinical and genetic biomarker subgroups, irrespective of mutation status. Adverse events occurred in 204 of 207 (98·6%) patients receiving sorafenib during the double-blind period and in 183 of 209 (87·6%) patients receiving placebo. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in the sorafenib group were hand-foot skin reaction (76·3%), diarrhoea (68·6%), alopecia (67·1%), and rash or desquamation (50·2%).Sorafenib significantly improved progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of sorafenib. These results suggest that sorafenib is a new treatment option for patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals and Onyx Pharmaceuticals (an Amgen subsidiary).","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768112","annotations":[{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.854404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.747018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.668188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.550289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Amgen","weight":0.196559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amgen"},{"name":"Phase III trial","weight":0.121109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_III_trial"},{"name":"Desquamation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desquamation"},{"name":"Bayer","weight":0.0743779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
