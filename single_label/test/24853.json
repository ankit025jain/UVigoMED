{"id":24853,"title":"The David procedure for salvage of a failing autograft after the Ross operation.","abstract":"Dilatation of the pulmonary autograft is a major fear after the Ross procedure. We analyzed the results after reoperation for autograft dysfunction using a valve-sparing reimplantation technique (David procedure).From 1995 to 2012, 645 Ross operations were performed, with 630 (98%) of these as freestanding root replacements (mean follow-up, 8.3 ± 4.6 years). Forty-nine autograft reoperations occurred in 46 patients (0.89%/patient-year). Between 2005 and 2013, reoperation using a David procedure was performed in 18 of 35 patients (52%) with autograft dilatation at a mean interval of 11 ± 3.2 years after the Ross operation.The mean age of 18 patients receiving a David procedure as reoperation was 49.8 ± 13.9 years; 83% were male. The 30-day reoperative mortality was zero. The mean vascular graft size used for reimplantation was 29.5 ± 1.7 mm. At a mean follow-up time of 3.2 ± 2.3 years (100% complete), all patients (18 of 18) were alive and in New York Heart Association functional class I. One patient (5%) needed valve replacement for recurrent aortic regurgitation 2.6 years after the David procedure. In the remaining patients (95%), freedom from aortic regurgitation of grade 2 or greater was 100% at 3 years (regurgitation grade <1, 14 of 17; 82%). Aortic valve gradients were clinically insignificant at 5.8 ± 2.1 mm Hg.Performing a David procedure was successful in the vast majority of patients with dilatation of the pulmonary autograft after a Ross operation and revealed good function of the preserved autograft at midterm follow-up. Reoperations could be performed with low perioperative morbidity and mortality.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Cardiovascular
