{"id":13282,"title":"Multi-detector computed tomography of an aortic dissection in a cat.","abstract":"Contrast enhanced, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) is a useful diagnostic imaging modality that has become increasingly available in veterinary medicine. Multi-planar and three-dimensional reconstructions allow accurate and comprehensive assessment of cardiac and vascular lesions with short image acquisition times. ECG-gated, contrast enhanced MDCT was used to assess the lesion extent and therapeutic options in a case of aortic dissection diagnosed in a hypertensive cat.
