{"id":88745,"title":"Comparison between tenocutaneous suture and Kessler suture techniques in treating acute closed Achilles tendon rupture.","abstract":"To compare the effectiveness of tenocutaneous suture and conventional Kessler suture techniques in treating acute closed Achilles tendon rupture.A total of 33 patients with acute closed Achilles tendon rupture who were admitted to our hospital from February 1998 to December 2008 underwent repair with either a tenocutaneous suture or Kessler suture technique. All patients were followed up for 1-5 years (mean, 3 years).According to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale, the excellence rate was 91% in the Kessler suture group and 98% in the tenocutaneous suture group, with a significant difference between groups.Our tenocutaneous suture technique is an effective method for treating Achilles tendon rupture. It has certain advantages compared with the conventional incision method and is worthy of wide clinical application.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796828","annotations":[{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.653337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.388231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.185786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.0783118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Achilles tendon rupture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon_rupture"},{"name":"Achilles","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"}]}
