{"id":13506,"title":"Photodynamic therapy inhibits the formation of hypertrophic scars in rabbit ears by regulating metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1.","abstract":"Hypertrophic scarring (HS) is a chronic skin condition, and inhibition of normal fibroblast ageing plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is known to inhibit synthesis of collagen proliferation in blood vessels and fibroblasts in scar tissue, with no significant adverse reactions reported.To investigate the effect of PDT in the rabbit ear model of HS, and the specific mechanism of action of PDT.We assessed the clinical and histopathological appearance of rabbit ears with HS with and without PDT. In addition, mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and concentration of ?-galactose were all measured to confirm cell senescence.Our data indicate that PDT can accelerate fibroblast ageing by increasing the ratio of MMPs to TIMP, in addition to promoting degradation of collagen and extracellular matrix, thereby inhibiting HS formation. These effects lasted for up to 60Â days, and induced no significant adverse local or systemic reactions. The efficacy of the treatment can be maximized by applying an appropriately high concentration of aminolaevulinic acid.PDT can induce senescence in fibroblasts, and may constitute a useful treatment for pathological scarring.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475901","annotations":[{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.914325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.582708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.462738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.422037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.309381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.281513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.250153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"}]}
