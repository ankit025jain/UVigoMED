{"id":33067,"title":"Rule-based category learning in Down syndrome.","abstract":"Rule-based category learning was examined in youths with Down syndrome (DS), youths with intellectual disability (ID), and typically developing (TD) youths. Two tasks measured category learning: the Modified Card Sort task (MCST) and the Concept Formation test of the Woodcock-Johnson-III ( Woodock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001 ). In regression-based analyses, DS and ID groups performed below the level expected for their nonverbal ability. In cross-sectional developmental trajectory analyses, results depended on the task. On the MCST, the DS and ID groups were similar to the TD group. On the Concept Formation test, the DS group had slower cross-sectional change than the other 2 groups. Category learning may be an area of difficulty for those with ID, but task-related factors may affect trajectories for youths with DS.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871791","annotations":[{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.351631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Nonverbal communication","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication"},{"name":"Neurotypical","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Concept learning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_learning"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Nintendo DS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Categories of New Testament manuscripts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_of_New_Testament_manuscripts"},{"name":"McGrew, Nebraska","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrew,_Nebraska"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"},{"name":"Sort, Lleida","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort,_Lleida"}]}
