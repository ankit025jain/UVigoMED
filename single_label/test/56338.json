{"id":56338,"title":"Late onset of a persistent, deep stromal scarring after PRK and corneal cross-linking in a patient with forme fruste keratoconus.","abstract":"To present a case of a late, deep stromal scar in a 22-year-old patient with forme fruste keratoconus who underwent combined corneal cross-linking and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).Topography-guided corneal cross-linking combined with corneal PRK (without complications) was performed in both eyes with a delay of 2 weeks between each eye.At the 5-month postoperative examination of the right eye, a localized corneal haze was circumscribed to the posterior deep stroma, signifying a decrease of visual acuity. However, this improved partially and temporarily when treated with topical corticoids during 2 years of follow-up and then reoccurred, affecting the corrected distance visual acuity.To the authors' knowledge, this is the first documented, clinical case presenting a deep stromal affectation without endothelial decompensation and visual acuity affectation as a postoperative complication following topography-guided PRK and corneal cross-linking.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702582","annotations":[{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.787712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.631014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.596813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.594757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.472412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.462548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.248676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.242591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Forme fruste","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forme_fruste"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Forme","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forme"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Haze","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Circumscription (taxonomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscription_(taxonomy)"}]}
