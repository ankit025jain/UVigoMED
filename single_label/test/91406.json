{"id":91406,"title":"Absorbent alginate fibres modified with hydrolysed chitosan for wound care dressings--II. Pilot scale development.","abstract":"Fibres have been used extensively in wound dressing applications as they provide a high surface area for absorption, ease of fabrication and softness. It is common practice for commercial wound dressings to be produced from natural materials, such a marine polysaccharides, as they are predominantly biocompatible, non-toxic, and often display bioactive properties, such as inherent antimicrobial activity. In this study hydrolysed chitosans were utilised as a sole coagulant for the production of alginate-chitosan fibres via a one-step, direct wet-spinning extrusion process. The levels of chitosan incorporated into the fibres were analysed quantitatively via elemental analysis and qualitatively by staining using Amido Black 10B. It was estimated that the fibres contained between 4.50 and 5.10% (wt.%) chitosan. The presence of chitosan improved tensile properties such as elongation and tenacity of the base alginate fibres. The increased incorporation of chitosan into the fibres also improved the absorption of the fibres in both saline and distilled water; reaching maximum of >30 g/g and >50 g/g, respectively. This work suggests that the observed hydrolysed chitosan content within the fibre may be optimal for the preparation of a novel fibre for wound care application.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507364","annotations":[{"name":"Water","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.772305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Alginic acid","weight":0.737514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alginic_acid"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Ultimate tensile strength","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.622723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.567905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.567905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Dietary fiber","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fiber"},{"name":"Salinity","weight":0.462569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.434793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Elemental analysis","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elemental_analysis"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.262983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Marine (ocean)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.0593413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chitosan","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitosan"},{"name":"Mohs scale of mineral hardness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"Salad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"}]}
