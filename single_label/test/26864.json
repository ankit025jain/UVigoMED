{"id":26864,"title":"Mitral annular morphology in mitral valve disease with three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography.","abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is useful for the quantification of mitral valve structures. The study aim was to investigate, in quantitative manner, any differences in mitral valve anatomy among patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) or functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), compared to normal control subjects.3D-TEE was performed in 20 MVP patients, 10 FMR patients and in 15 control subjects. Analyses of the full-volume 3D mitral valve data sets were performed offline, using Q-Lab software.Distinctive patterns were identified in annular geometric changes in normal subjects compared to patients with MVP or FMR. Patients with FMR showed significant annular anterior to posterior dilatation (34.6 +/- 8.3 mm versus 28.4 +/- 2.9 mm, p < 0.04: FMR versus control), whereas in patients with MVP dilatation in the anterolateral to posteromedial diameter was more prominent (41.0 +/- 5.9 mm versus 36.6 +/- 2.4 mm, p < 0.03; MVP versus control).3D-TEE represents a useful method for the evaluation of mitral valve geometry.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076550","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.510532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.414064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.208641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.127918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.074308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.0321906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.0283191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mitral valve prolapse","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_prolapse"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Annulus (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Data set (IBM mainframe)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set_(IBM_mainframe)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Most Valuable Player","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Valuable_Player"},{"name":"Trans Europ Express","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Europ_Express"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Transesophageal echocardiography","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transesophageal_echocardiography"}]}
