{"id":13124,"title":"Effects of erythropoietin on ischemia, follicular survival, and ovarian function in ovarian grafts.","abstract":"Ovarian tissue transplantation is performed to preserve fertility in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and free radical production occurring during the revascularization of the transplanted tissue are the major limitations of this procedure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) as an antioxidant on oxidative stress and ovary survival following transplantation. The Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice (4-5 weeks old) were divided into three groups (six mice per group): control; autograft+saline, and autograft+EPO (500 ?IU/kg i.p.). After 28 days, ovary compartments were estimated stereologically. DNA fragmentation and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), progesterone, and estradiol (E2) concentrations were also evaluated. The results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test, and the means were significantly different at P<0.05. The mean total volume of ovary, cortex, and medulla and the number of follicles increased significantly in the autograft+EPO group (P<0.01). Apoptosis rate in the autograft+EPO group was lower than that in the autograft+saline group. The concentration of MDA decreased significantly in the autografted EPO-treated group than in the autografted saline-treated group (P<0.01). The concentration of E2 increased significantly in the autograft+EPO group than in the autograft+saline group (P<0.01). EPO reduced IR injury, increasing follicle survival and function in grafted ovaries.
