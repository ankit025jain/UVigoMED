{"id":85618,"title":"Transfusion-related acute lung injury.","abstract":"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is defined as the onset or the worsening of respiratory distress within 6? h of the transfusion of a plasma-containing blood component. It is currently considered to be one of the leading causes of severe posttransfusion morbidity and acute mortality in countries with a high development index. Understanding of the pathogenesis of TRALI has resulted in the development of preventive measures that have contributed to reducing its incidence. Early recognition of the clinical symptoms allow the clinician to identify the syndrome and to undertake therapeutic measures that may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this complication.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892308","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.668308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.65114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.635017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
