{"id":70782,"title":"[Diagnostic value of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/ computed tomography for N-and M-staging of malignant melanoma].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for N and M staging of malignant melanoma.A total of 114 patients (69 males, 45 females) with AJCC stage II-IV malignant melanoma were recruited. The diagnostic accuracy for N- and M-staging was determined for CT alone, PET alone and PET/CT.PET/CT imaging provided significantly more accurate interpretations regarding overall N- and M-staging than PET or CT alone (97.4% vs 94.7% and 88.6%). Overall N- and M-stage was correctly determined by PET/CT (98.2%) versus PET (93.9%) and CT (83.3%) and the differences were significant (P < 0.01).The diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT is excellent for N- and M-staging of melanoma patients, especially for detecting or excluding distant metastases.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142850","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.779881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.647956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.518915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.359143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.327459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"American Joint Committee on Cancer","weight":0.110498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Joint_Committee_on_Cancer"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
