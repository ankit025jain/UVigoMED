{"id":38597,"title":"Successful induction of labor of late-second-trimester conjoined twins: an alternative to hysterotomy.","abstract":"To demonstrate that vaginal delivery is a safe alternative to hysterotomy when planning pregnancy termination of late-second-trimester conjoined twins. We present two cases of conjoined twins in the late second trimester desiring pregnancy termination.The first case involved a multiparous 29-year-old woman at 23 6/7 weeks of gestation with thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins. The second case involved an 18-year-old primigravid woman at 25 1/7 weeks of gestation with pyopagus conjoined twins. Both desired pregnancy termination and to avoid hysterotomy. Inductions were initiated with Laminaria and augmented with vaginal misoprostol or oxytocin. Both patients had uncomplicated vaginal deliveries of intact conjoined twins without significant maternity morbidity.Induction of labor and vaginal delivery can be a safe method for late-second-trimester termination of pregnancies with conjoined twins.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413234","annotations":[{"name":"Oxytocin","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin"},{"name":"Misoprostol","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol"},{"name":"Hysterotomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterotomy"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Laminaria","weight":0.812764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminaria"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.783564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.779157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.727627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Conjoined twins","weight":0.489423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.326696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Vaginal delivery","weight":0.209369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_delivery"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.12173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"}]}
