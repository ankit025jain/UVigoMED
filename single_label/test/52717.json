{"id":52717,"title":"The rate of high ovarian response in women identified at risk by a high serum AMH level is influenced by the type of gonadotropin.","abstract":"The aim was to compare ovarian response and clinical outcome of potential high-responders after stimulation with highly purified menotropin (HP-hMG) or recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) for in vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Retrospective analysis was performed on data collected in two randomized controlled trials, one conducted following a long GnRH agonist protocol and the other with an antagonist protocol. Potential high-responders (n?=?155 and n?=?188 in the agonist and antagonist protocol, respectively) were defined as having an initial anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) value >75th percentile (5.2?ng/ml). In both protocols, HP-hMG stimulation in women in the high AMH category was associated with a significantly lower occurrence of high response (?15 oocytes retrieved) than rFSH stimulation; 33% versus 51% (p?=?0.025) and 31% versus 49% (p?=?0.015) in the long agonist and antagonist protocol, respectively. In the potential high-responder women, trends for improved live birth rate were observed with HP-hMG compared with rFSH (long agonist protocol: 33% versus 20%, p?=?0.074; antagonist protocol: 34% versus 23%, p?=?0.075; overall population: 34% versus 22%, p?=?0.012). In conclusion, the type of gonadotropin used for ovarian stimulation influences high-response rates and potentially clinical outcome in women identified as potential high-responders.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576226","annotations":[{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.754218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.709619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.669734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.62558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.594943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Menotropin","weight":0.194419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menotropin"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Birth rate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Antimullerian hormone","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimullerian_hormone"},{"name":"75th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
