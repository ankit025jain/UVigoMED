{"id":54479,"title":"An evaluation of the effectiveness of a multi-modal intervention in frail and pre-frail older people with type 2 diabetes--the MID-Frail study: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"Diabetes, a highly prevalent, chronic disease, is associated with increasing frailty and functional decline in older people, with concomitant personal, social, and public health implications. We describe the rationale and methods of the multi-modal intervention in diabetes in frailty (MID-Frail) study.The MID-Frail study is an open, randomised, multicentre study, with random allocation by clusters (each trial site) to a usual care group or an intervention group. A total of 1,718 subjects will be randomised with each site enrolling on average 14 or 15 subjects. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate, in comparison with usual clinical practice, the effectiveness of a multi-modal intervention (specific clinical targets, education, diet, and resistance training exercise) in frail and pre-frail subjects aged ?70Â years with type 2 diabetes in terms of the difference in function 2 years post-randomisation. Difference in function will be measured by changes in a summary ordinal score on the short physical performance battery (SPPB) of at least one point. Secondary outcomes include daily activities, economic evaluation, and quality of life.The MID-Frail study will provide evidence on the clinical, functional, social, and economic impact of a multi-modal approach in frail and pre-frail older people with type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456998","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.640172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.551527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.323482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.292047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.270057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Resistance training","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_training"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Ranking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Economic system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
