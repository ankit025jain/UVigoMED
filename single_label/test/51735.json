{"id":51735,"title":"Cross sectional study to evaluate the effect of duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus on the nerve conduction velocity in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.","abstract":"To study the nerve conduction velocity in clinically undetectable and detectable peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus with variable duration.This cross sectional study was conducted in diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. They were divided in groups: Group I (n=37) with clinically detectable diabetic peripheral neuropathy of shorter duration and Group II (n=27) with clinically detectable diabetic peripheral neuropathy of longer duration. They were compared with T2DM patients (n=22) without clinical neuropathy. Clinical diagnosis was based on neuropathy symptom score (NSS) and neuropathy disability score (NDS) for signs. Nerve conduction velocity was measured in both upper and lower limbs. Median, ulnar, common peroneal and posterior tibial nerves were selected for motor nerve conduction study and median and sural nerves were selected for sensory nerve conduction study.The comparisons were done between nerve conduction velocities of motor and sensory nerves in patients of clinically detectable neuropathy and patients without neuropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus population. This study showed significant electrophysiological changes with duration of disease. Nerve conduction velocities in lower limbs were significantly reduced even in patients of shorter duration with normal upper limb nerve conduction velocities.Diabetic neuropathy symptom score (NSS) and neuropathy disability score (NDS) can help in evaluation of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy though nerve conduction study is more powerful test and can help in diagnosing cases of neuropathy.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661759","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.857921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Nerve conduction study","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_study"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nerve conduction velocity","weight":0.801166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_velocity"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Sensory nerve","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_nerve"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.675649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.480002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.476451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.454017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.330365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.223525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.124353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Common fibular nerve","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_fibular_nerve"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tibial nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibial_nerve"},{"name":"Sural nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sural_nerve"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Crossbreed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbreed"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
