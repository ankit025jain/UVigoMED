{"id":45792,"title":"NEDD9 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in gastric cancer.","abstract":"In this study, the expression of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) in benign and malignant gastric tissues was investigated, and the significance of NEDD9 in gastric cancer prognosis was explored. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect NEDD9 expression in gastric cancer, nontumor gastric, and normal gastric tissues. The relationship between NEDD9 expression in gastric cancer tissues and the clinicopathologic factors was examined using the Mann-Whitney U test. The two factors between NEDD9 expression and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage in gastric cancer patients were analyzed by Spearman rank correlation analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the overall survival of NEDD9 negative, weak positive expression, and strong positive expression group. NEDD9 expression rates were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in gastric cancer tissues (162 out of 187, 86.6 %) compared with normal (2 out of 11, 18.2 %) and nontumor (11 out of 58, 19.0 %) gastric tissues. The upregulated NEDD9 expression in gastric cancer tissue was significantly correlated with high preoperative CEA level (P = 0.044), poor differentiation (P = 0.007), tissue invasion (P = 0.015), present lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), and high TNM stage (P < 0.001). NEDD9 expression was positively correlated with clinical TNM stage. Advancing clinical TNM stage corresponded with higher NEDD9 expression (r s = 0.289, P < 0.001). The overall 5-year survival of gastric cancer patients with strong positive NEDD9 expression was significantly shorter compared with the survival of NEDD9 negative and weakly positive expression group. NEDD9 may be used as a biomarker in the clinical setting to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664584","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.730905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.655405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.498415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.447774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.408601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.227665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Precursor cell","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_cell"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
