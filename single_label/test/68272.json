{"id":68272,"title":"Charlson comorbidity index is an important prognostic factor for long-term survival outcomes in Korean men with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.","abstract":"To analyze overall survival (OS), prostate cancer (PCa)-specific survival (PCaSS), and non-PCaSS according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) after radical prostatectomy (RP) for PCa.Data from 336 patients who had RP for PCa between 1992 and 2005 were analyzed. Data included age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, clinical stage, and pathologic stage. Pre-existing comorbidities were evaluated by the CCI, and patients were classified into two CCI score categories (0, ?1).The mean age of patients was 64.31Â±6.12 years. The median PSA value (interquartile range, IQR) was 11.30 (7.35 and 21.02) ng/mL with a median follow-up period (IQR) of 96.0 (85.0 and 121.0) months. The mean CCI was 0.28 (0-4). Five-year OS, PCaSS, and non-PCaSS were 91.7%, 96.3%, and 95.2%, respectively. Ten-year OS, PCaSS, and non-PCaSS were 81.9%, 92.1%, and 88.9%, respectively. The CCI had a significant influence on OS (p=0.022) and non-PCaSS (p=0.008), but not on PCaSS (p=0.681), by log-rank test. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, OS was independently associated with the CCI [hazard ratio (HR)=1.907, p=0.025] and Gleason score (HR=2.656, p<0.001). PCaSS was independently associated with pathologic N stage (HR=2.857, p=0.031), pathologic T stage (HR=3.775, p=0.041), and Gleason score (HR=4.308, p=0.001). Non-PCaSS had a significant association only with the CCI (HR=2.540, p=0.009).The CCI was independently associated with both OS and non-PCaSS after RP, but the CCI had no impact on PCaSS. The comorbidities of a patient should be considered before selecting RP as a curative modality for PCa.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital
