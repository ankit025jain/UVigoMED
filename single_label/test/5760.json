{"id":5760,"title":"Effect of genetic and pharmacological blockade of GABA receptors on the 5-HT2C receptor function during stress.","abstract":"Serotonin (5-HT)2C receptors play a role in psychoaffective disorders and often contribute to the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of psychotropic drugs. During stress, activation of these receptors exerts a negative feedback on 5-HT release, probably by increasing the activity of GABAergic interneurons. However, to date, the GABA receptor types that mediate the 5-HT2C receptor-induced feedback inhibition are still unknown. To address this question, we assessed the inhibition of 5-HT turnover by a 5-HT2C receptor agonist (RO 60-0175) at the hippocampal level and under conditions of stress, after pharmacological or genetic inactivation of either GABA-A or GABA-B receptors in mice. Neither the GABA-B receptor antagonist phaclofen nor the specific genetic ablation of either GABA-B1a or GABA-B1b subunits altered the inhibitory effect of RO 60-0175, although 5-HT turnover was markedly decreased in GABA-B1a knock-out mice in both basal and stress conditions. In contrast, the 5-HT2C receptor-mediated inhibition of 5-HT turnover was reduced by the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline. However, a significant effect of 5-HT2C receptor activation persisted in mutant mice deficient in the ?3 subunit of GABA-A receptors. It can be inferred that non-?3 subunit-containing GABA-A receptors, but not GABA-B receptors, mediate the 5-HT2C -induced inhibition of stress-induced increase in hippocampal 5-HT turnover in mice.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25113583","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiolytic","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic"},{"name":"GABA receptor","weight":0.88562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.806801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Negative feedback","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.775591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Interneuron","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"GABAA receptor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.60681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.488884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.458411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.430087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"GABAB receptor","weight":0.286474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAB_receptor"},{"name":"Bicuculline","weight":0.17995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicuculline"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
