{"id":62197,"title":"Concurrent juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma with a shared missense mutation in NRAS.","abstract":"Single cases of B- and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma occurring after remission of JMML, and JMML occurring after remission of B-lymphoblastic leukemia have been reported in the literature. We present a unique case of a child with concurrent JMML and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma in which an identical missense mutation in NRAS was found in both the neoplastic JMML and T-LBL cells. JMML has been considered a stem cell disorder, and our case provides additional molecular evidence for a stem cell lesion underlying the two different disease phenotypes.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610751","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.822386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.458923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"}]}
