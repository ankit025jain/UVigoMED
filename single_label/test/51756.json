{"id":51756,"title":"A quantification model of Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes in children with idiopathic precocious puberty and early puberty.","abstract":"To establish a quantification model of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes by sampling patients undergoing idiopathic precocious puberty (IPP) and early puberty.A questionnaire for classifying and quantifying TCM syndromes was designed and administered. All the results were analyzed; the relationship between 3 types of syndrome and 47 symptoms were summated. Meanwhile, the frequency distribution of each symptom or sign was aggregated. Fuzzy mathematics was used to develop a quantification model ofTCM syndromes.We found that precocious puberty had 3 types of syndrome, including hyperactivity of fire due to Yin deficiency (Syndrome I), depressed liver Qi transforming into fire (Syndrome II), and end retention of damp heat (Syndrome III). In the IPP group, Syndrome I was the most common principal syndrome (100%). Forty-six patients (43.81%) were diagnosed with Syndrome I accompanied by Syndrome II and 11 (10.48%) were diagnosed with Syndrome I accompanied by Syndrome III. In the early puberty group, Syndrome I was also the main syndrome (98.39%). The degrees of most symptoms were mild to moderate. Reddened tongue was the most common tongue manifestation (62.86% prevalence) in the IPP group. The most common pulse manifestations were slippery pulse, thread pulse, and taut pulse. The Asymptotic Normalization Coefficient (ANC) method was used to quantify the TCM syndromes in 167 cases. Diagnostic accuracy rate reached 91%, comparable to expert diagnosis.We find that there are 3 types of syndrome in the IPP group and in the early puberty group. Syndrome I (hyperactivity of fire due to Yin deficiency) is the main syndrome in the two groups. ANC may be an appropriate for quantification model of TCM syndromes.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660587","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.695457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.598223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.552547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.548447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.496625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.489401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.255411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.149844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lingua franca","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"African National Congress","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Precocious puberty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty"},{"name":"Fire","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Humidity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
