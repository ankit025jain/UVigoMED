{"id":2882,"title":"[Clinical efficacy of Vitrum Memory in patients with glaucoma and dry form of age-related macular degeneration].","abstract":"The study was conducted to assess clinical efficacy of Vitrum Memory in therapeutic dosage for 3 months in patients with glaucoma and dry form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Survey data, visual acuity, biomicroscopy, computer perimetry, electrophysiological studies (EPS): visual evoked potentials (VEP) and pattern electroretinogram (pattern ERG), HRT-3 and OCT were evaluated. Subjective improvement, reduction of visual and mental fatigue, increase of light sensitivity, as well as statistically significant improvement in visual functions (at both computer perimetry and EPS) were achieved.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306732","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.643089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.524765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.503324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.424501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.356763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)","weight":0.304211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.244175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Photophobia","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophobia"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.0421175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Cardiac electrophysiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_electrophysiology"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polystyrene","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"}]}
