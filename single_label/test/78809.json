{"id":78809,"title":"[Significance of exhaled nitric oxide measurement in remitting childhood asthma with concurrent remitting rhinitis].","abstract":"To evaluate the value of exhaled nitric oxide in the severity evaluation of asthmatic children with remitting rhinitis.A total of 214 asthmatic children were randomly allocated to a untreated control and a conventional treatment group. Patients in each of the two subclasses were classified as asthma with concurrent rhinitis and asthma without concurrent rhinitis. Values of the 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (PC20FEV1) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were measured.The PC20FEV1 level was significantly higher in untreated asthma patients without rhinitis than in those with concurrent rhinitis (P<0.05), while FeNO was not significantly different between these two groups (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in both FeNO and PC20FEV1 between treated asthma patients with and without concurrent rhinitis (P>0.05). PC20FEV1 was significantly increased (P<0.05) but FeNO was significantly decreased (P<0.05) in asthma patients with concurrent rhinitis after conventional treatment. In asthmatic children without concurrent rhinitis, treatment significantly decreased the level of FeNO (P<0.05) but had not effect on PC20FEV1 (P>0.05).Exhaled nitric oxide measurement may be useful in the severity evaluation of asthmatic children with remitting rhinitis.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568910","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.512847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.122128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.0540614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Exhaled nitric oxide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaled_nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
