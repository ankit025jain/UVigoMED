{"id":85907,"title":"The five-point Likert scale for dyspnea can properly assess the degree of pulmonary congestion and predict adverse events in heart failure outpatients.","abstract":"Proper assessment of dyspnea is important in patients with heart failure. Our aim was to evaluate the use of the 5-point Likert scale for dyspnea to assess the degree of pulmonary congestion and to determine the prognostic value of this scale for predicting adverse events in heart failure outpatients.We undertook a prospective study of outpatients with moderate to severe heart failure. The 5-point Likert scale was applied during regular outpatient visits, along with clinical assessments. Lung ultrasound with ?15 B-lines and an amino-terminal portion of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level >1000 pg/mL were used as a reference for pulmonary congestion. The patients were then assessed every 30 days during follow-up to identify adverse clinical outcomes.We included 58 patients (65.5% male, age 43.5 ± 11 years) with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 27 ± 6%. In total, 29.3% of these patients had heart failure with ischemic etiology. Additionally, pulmonary congestion, as diagnosed by lung ultrasound, was present in 58% of patients. A higher degree of dyspnea (3 or 4 points on the 5-point Likert scale) was significantly correlated with a higher number of B-lines (p = 0.016). Patients stratified into Likert = 3-4 were at increased risk of admission compared with those in class 1-2 after adjusting for age, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class and levels of NT-proBNP >1000 pg/mL (HR = 4.9, 95% CI 1.33-18.64, p = 0.017).In our series, higher baseline scores on the 5-point Likert scale were related to pulmonary congestion and were independently associated with adverse events during follow-up. This simple clinical tool can help to identify patients who are more likely to decompensate and whose treatment should be intensified.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838900","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.626514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.605697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.604832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"New York Heart Association Functional Classification","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Heart_Association_Functional_Classification"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Predation","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"York","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Postgraduate education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
