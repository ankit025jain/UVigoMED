{"id":84308,"title":"A high glycerol-containing leave-on scalp care treatment to improve dandruff.","abstract":"Dandruff is a common cosmetic condition associated with flaky scalp skin and pruritus. It is generally treated with regular use of antifungal-based shampoos. Research into factors underlying the characteristic skin lesions has revealed perturbations in epidermal differentiation and a dramatic deterioration in the associated process of stratum corneum (SC) maturation. These observations suggest that directly addressing the quality of the SC could have a scalp benefit. In this study, the authors investigated the efficacy of a moisturising leave-on lotion (LOL) containing a high concentration of glycerol (10%) and other known skin benefit agents (saturated fatty acid and sunflower seed oil) to reduce dandruff over an 8-week treatment period with 3 applications per week. Results of expert visual grading and biophysical measurements of SC parameters (transepidermal water loss and hydration) revealed a significant reduction in the dandruffcondition over this period, with significant improvement in both SC water barrier function and hydration. These scalp skin benefits were maintained for up to a week following cessation of the treatment. This study indicates that use of a glycerol-rich substantive LOL, designed to directly improve the quality of the SC barrier can have a significant impact on the dandruff condition.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134312","annotations":[{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Sunflower seed","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_seed"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Sunflower","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower"},{"name":"Sunflower oil","weight":0.795801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_oil"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Vegetable fats and oils","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_fats_and_oils"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.763324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Shampoo","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo"},{"name":"Dandruff","weight":0.70715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandruff"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Stratum corneum","weight":0.590137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.57516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.453812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.40097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.378273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Lotion","weight":0.24874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotion"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Biophysics","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.124614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0522849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Cheese","weight":0.0261065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese"},{"name":"Dam","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Adjective","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Hydration reaction","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydration_reaction"}]}
