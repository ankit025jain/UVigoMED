{"id":24195,"title":"Simple technique for gasless transumbilical single-incisional laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy.","abstract":"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery has recently received more attention. We developed a novel simple technique of gasless transumbilical single-incisional laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy (TUSILAA) and retrospectively analyzed our initial experience.TUSILAA has been attempted in 50 consecutive patients with acute appendicitis. The vertical incision through the umbilicus was used for laparoscopic access and the abdominal wall was lifted by a Kent retractor set system.Our technique was successful in 45 out of 50 (90 %) patients. The median operating time was 59 min (range 35-140). The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (range 2-12). None of the cases were converted to open appendectomy. There were no perioperative surgical complications.Our novel technique, gasless TUSILAA, is safe and feasible with acceptable operative time and excellent cosmetic result. Furthermore, this procedure has the advantage of cost-effectiveness since any disposable instruments including trocars, staplers, or expensive devices are not required. Therefore, this could be used as the first-choice surgical procedure for selected patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449261","annotations":[{"name":"Appendectomy","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy"},{"name":"Appendicitis","weight":0.795066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Navel","weight":0.638618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.397643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.296901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.275453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.274482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.197271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.122269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent"},{"name":"Family of sets","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_sets"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Retractor (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractor_(medical)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Staplers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staplers"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"}]}
