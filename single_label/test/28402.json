{"id":28402,"title":"Participation in a novel treatment component during residential substance use treatment is associated with improved outcome: a pilot study.","abstract":"A person-centered substance use treatment component, the Natural Recovery Program, was developed. The Natural Recovery Program is comprised of small group therapy combined with pursuit of hobbies.This was a pilot study of the program and was not randomized. A retrospective record review of 643 veterans in an inpatient mental health recovery and rehabilitation program was analyzed to determine if participants of Natural Recovery had a different rate of treatment completion than those who elected to participate in the core program alone. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted on: participation in the Natural Recovery Program; co-morbid psychiatric disorders; and legal, medical, and psychiatric issues.Participation in Natural Recovery was significantly associated with successful treatment completion when analyzed by univariate analysis (p?=?0.01). Other significant variables associated with successful completion included: no co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis, fewer prior suicide attempts, and no homelessness prior to admission. Binary logistic regression demonstrated that participation in Natural Recovery was associated with improved treatment completion, even when other variables were considered (p?=?0.01). Treatment retention was longer for patients who participated in Natural Recovery, even if they did not complete treatment.The Natural Recovery Program was associated with improved outcomes, as measured by treatment retention in the first 60Â days and by treatment completion. Participants of Natural Recovery with co-morbid psychiatric disorders completed treatment at a higher rate than those with co-morbid psychiatric disorders who participated in the core program. Patients reported high satisfaction with the program. This program may be a valuable adjunct to residential treatment.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886745","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.735321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.594293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Recovery model","weight":0.588761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_model"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.560249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.456982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.247364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.193022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.159096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Residential treatment center","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_treatment_center"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0443781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Veteran","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Hobby","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Boarding school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
