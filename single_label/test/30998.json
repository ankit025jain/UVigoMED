{"id":30998,"title":"Drug allergies and implications for dental practice.","abstract":"Adverse reactions to medications prescribed or administered in dental practice can be worrying. Most of these reactions are somewhat predictable based on the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug. Others, such as allergic and pseudoallergic reactions, are generally unpredictable and unrelated to normal drug action. This article will review immune and nonimmune-mediated mechanisms that account for allergic and related reactions to the particular drug classes commonly used in dentistry. The appropriate management of these reactions will also be addressed.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423421","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.252321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.2098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Drug action","weight":0.110913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_action"},{"name":"Multiple chemical sensitivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity"},{"name":"Drug allergy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_allergy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"}]}
