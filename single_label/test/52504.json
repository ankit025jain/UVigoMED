{"id":52504,"title":"Treatment with brain natriuretic peptide prevents the development of cardiac dysfunction in obese diabetic db/db mice.","abstract":"Obesity and diabetes increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and heart failure. These metabolic disorders are generally reflected by natriuretic peptide system deficiency. Since brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is known to influence metabolism and cardioprotection, we investigated the effect of chronic exogenous BNP treatment on adverse myocardial consequences related to obesity and diabetes.Ten-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db obese diabetic mice (db/db) and their lean control littermates (db/+) were treated with BNP (0.6 ?g kg(-1) h(-1)) or saline for 12 weeks (n?=?10/group). Serial blood and tomography analysis were performed. Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography, and biochemical and histological heart and fat analyses were also performed.BNP treatment resulted in an average increase in plasma BNP levels of 70 pg/ml. An improvement in the metabolic profile of db/db mice was observed, including a reduction in fat content, increased insulin sensitivity, improved glucose tolerance and lower blood glucose, despite increased food intake. db/db mice receiving saline displayed both early systolic and diastolic dysfunction, whereas these functional changes were prevented by BNP treatment. The cardioprotective effects of BNP were attributed to the inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, myocardial fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy and the AGE-receptor for AGE (RAGE) system as well as normalisation of cardiac AMP-activated protein kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activities.Our results indicate that chronic BNP treatment at low dose improves the metabolic profile and prevents the development of myocardial dysfunction in db/db mice.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System
