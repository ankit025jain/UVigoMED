{"id":69387,"title":"Abdominal circumference in relation to body weight gain/loss in patients on chronic hemodialysis.","abstract":"to determine a constant relationship between changes in abdominal circumference (in centimeter) and body weight (in kilogram) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.experimental-analytical study in patients with CKD on hemodialysis, using before and after treatment design at the Dialysis Unit of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta. The sample were selected consecutively. Weighing and abdominal circumference measurements were done at the time of before and after hemodialysis session on the same day. Repeated measurements were performed on different days in 104 subjects to achieve the target sample size of 676. Serum albumin level were also measured on the patients.there was a strong (r=0.838) and significant (p=0.000) correlation between mean body weight and mean abdominal circumferences before and after hemodialysis. In the calculation of the regression between the mean body weight before and after hemodialysis (X) with a mean abdominal circumference before and after hemodialysis (Y), regression formula: Y=34.94 + 0.84 X was obtained. There was no significant correlation between serum albumin levels (3.93Â±0.40 g/dL) and abdominal circumference before hemodialysis, abdominal circumference after hemodialysis, and the mean abdominal circumference before and after hemodialysis.prediction of weight changes in patients with CKD on chronic hemodialysis, can be measured through the abdominal circumference measurement before and after hemodialysis.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448332","annotations":[{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.841674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.741293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.73685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.328919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.295171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Jakarta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Calculator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"838","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/838"},{"name":"930","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/930"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tjipto_Mangoenkoesoemo"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
