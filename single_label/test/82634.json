{"id":82634,"title":"Id1 and NF-?B promote the generation of CD133+ and BMI-1+ keratinocytes and the growth of xenograft tumors in mice.","abstract":"Id1 and NF-?B are highly expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Whether they have a synergistic role in the carcinogenesis of OSCC is unclear. The current study was designed to demonstrate the synergy of both Id1 and NF-?B in the underlying disease mechanisms of OSCC using in vitro and in vivo animal models. Id1 and NF-?B strengthened the expression of both CD133 and BMI-1 in OSCC cell cultures. CD133(+) and BMI-1(+) keratinocytes from OSCC tissues and cell cultures initiated the growth of xenograft tumors in SCID/Beige mice. Id1 and NF-?B regulate the expression of CD133 and BMI-1 in an additive or synergistic manner in OSCC, which is associated with the generation of na√Øve and self-renewable keratinocytes and initiate the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572994","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.631481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.368607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Id, ego and super-ego","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
