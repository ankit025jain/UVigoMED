{"id":30423,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of a programme of screening and brief interventions for alcohol in primary care in Italy.","abstract":"As alcohol-related health problems continue to rise, the attention of policy-makers is increasingly turning to Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) programmes. The effectiveness of such programmes in primary healthcare is well evidenced, but very few cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted and none which specifically consider the Italian context.The Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model has been used to model the cost-effectiveness of government pricing and public health policies in several countries including England. This study adapts the model using Italian data to evaluate a programme of screening and brief interventions in Italy. Results are reported as Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) of SBI programmes versus a 'do-nothing' scenario.Model results show such programmes to be highly cost-effective, with estimated ICERs of €550/Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained for a programme of SBI at next GP registration and €590/QALY for SBI at next GP consultation. A range of sensitivity analyses suggest these results are robust under all but the most pessimistic assumptions.This study provides strong support for the promotion of a policy of screening and brief interventions throughout Italy, although policy makers should be aware of the resource implications of different implementation options.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502342","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"England","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.527547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.524734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.40319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Sheffield","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield"},{"name":"Health policy","weight":0.246949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Politician","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"590","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/590"},{"name":"State Bank of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Promotion and relegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation"},{"name":"Interventionism (politics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventionism_(politics)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Increment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment"},{"name":"Pessimism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism"},{"name":"Pricing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"},{"name":"Screenwriting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriting"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Quality-adjusted life year","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"}]}
