{"id":81286,"title":"Post removal techniques part 1.","abstract":"Dismantling restorations from teeth which require endodontic re-treatment can be difficult. Many dentists are reluctant to remove posts through fear of weakening, perforating or fracturing the remaining root structure. A variety of techniques have been described and developed for post removal. This is the first in a series of two papers which provide an overview of these techniques.The rationale for endodontic re-treatment, pre-operative assessment and factors affecting post removal are discussed. Techniques are illustrated with clinical case reports. The second paper describes the use of specific post removal devices and the removal of fibre posts.Endodontic re-treatment has a more successful long-term outcome than surgical treatment for failed root canal treatment. This may involve the removal of existing post restorations or portions thereof.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195480","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.692953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.662005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.539226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.352692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.184345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Endodontic retreatment","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_retreatment"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Nuclear decommissioning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_decommissioning"},{"name":"Proto-Indo-European root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_root"},{"name":"Perforation (oil well)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation_(oil_well)"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
