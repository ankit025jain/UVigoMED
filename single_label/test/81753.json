{"id":81753,"title":"Treatment of amalgam tattoo with a subepithelial connective tissue graft and acellular dermal matrix.","abstract":"A 54-year-old female was referred for management of a large amalgam tattoo involving the alveolar mucosa between teeth #6 and #9. The lesion had been present for over 20 years following endodontic treatment of teeth #7 and #8. A two-stage surgical approach was used to remove the pigmentation, beginning with removal of amalgam fragments from the underlying bone and placement of a subepithelial connective tissue graft and acellular dermal matrix to increase soft tissue thickness subadjacent to the amalgam. Following 7 weeks of healing, gingivoplasty was performed to remove the overlying pigmented tissue. At the 21-month follow-up appointment, the patient exhibited naturally appearing soft tissue with no evidence of amalgam tattoo.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844028","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.735403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.566265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.550471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.516713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Tattoo","weight":0.436135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.2865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Amalgam (dentistry)","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Non-cellular life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life"}]}
