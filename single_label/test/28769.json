{"id":28769,"title":"Alcohol use, stigmatizing/discriminatory attitudes, and HIV high-risk sexual behaviors among men who have sex with men in China.","abstract":"This research was conducted to assess the correlates of alcohol consumption and HIV/AIDS-related stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shandong province, China.A cross-sectional survey provided demographics, sexual behaviors, illicit drug use, alcohol consumptions, and service utilization.Of 1,230 participants, 82.8% were single, 85.7% aged <35 years, 47.2% had college or higher education, and 11.7% drank alcohol >3 times per week in the past six months. The average total score of stigmatizing and discriminatory attitude was 37.4 Â± 4.4. More frequent episodes of alcohol use were independently associated with higher levels of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination, unprotected anal sex, bisexual identity, multiple male sex partners, drug use, and lower levels of education. Expressing higher levels of HIV/AIDS-related stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes was independently associated with alcohol use, unprotected male anal sex, bisexuals, more male sex partners, commercial sex with men, and non-receipt of peer education in the past year.HIV/AIDS-related stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes are common and associated with alcohol use and unprotected sex among MSM. The finding highlights the needs to develop programs that would reduce HIV/AIDS-related stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes and strengthen alcohol use prevention and risk reduction initiatives among MSM.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795879","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.830225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Safe sex","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex"},{"name":"Bisexuality","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Prostitution","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.672465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.58467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.579123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.568469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.521646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.458923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.333641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.309965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.29978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Sexual partner","weight":0.295321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_partner"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Catamite","weight":0.13635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamite"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Polyandry","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry"},{"name":"Television advertisement","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Reductionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"}]}
