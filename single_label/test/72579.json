{"id":72579,"title":"RNA-Seq analysis identifies aberrant RNA splicing of TRIP12 in acute myeloid leukemia patients at remission.","abstract":"Aberrant splicing events play important roles in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate the aberrant splicing events in AML during treatment, we carried out RNA sequencing in peripheral mononuclear cell samples from a patient with complete remission. In addition to the sequencing samples, selected splicing events were confirmed and validated with real-time quantitative RT-PCR in another seven pairs of samples. A total of 4.05 and 3.39 GB clean data of the AML and remission sample were generated, respectively, and 2,223 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Integrated with gene expression profiling on T cells from AML patients compared with healthy donors, 82 DEGs were also differentially expressed in AML CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells. Twenty-three alternative splicing events were considered to be confidential, and they were involved in many biological processes, such as RNA processing, cellular macromolecule catabolic process, and DNA binding process. An exon3-skipping event in TRIP12 was detected in patients at remission and further validated in another three independent samples. TRIP12 is an ubiquitin ligase of ARF, which suppresses aberrant cell growth by activating p53 responses. The exon3-skipping isoform of TRIP12 increased significantly after treatment. Our results may provide new understanding of AML, and the confirmed alternative splicing event of TRIP12 may be used as potential target for future investigations.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961348","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Macromolecule","weight":0.847652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule"},{"name":"Alternative splicing","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Ubiquitin ligase","weight":0.815354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.809437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Ubiquitin","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.788683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.716845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.630468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.618974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.566462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.542457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Post-transcriptional modification","weight":0.522917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.343345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"DNA-binding domain","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-binding_domain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.120329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Confidentiality","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
