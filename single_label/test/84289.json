{"id":84289,"title":"Elevated FGF21 leads to attenuated postnatal linear growth in preterm infants through GH resistance in chondrocytes.","abstract":"The hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a key metabolic regulator in the adaptation to fasting. In food-restricted mice, inhibition of skeletal growth is mediated by the antagonistic effect of FGF21 on GH action in the liver and growth plate.The objective of the study was to assess the role of FGF21 in growth regulation in humans using postnatal growth failure of very preterm infants as a model.FGF21 levels were measured serially in very preterm infants, and their linear growth evaluated from birth to term-equivalent age. Primary chondrocytes obtained from pediatric donors were used to test whether FGF21 can directly interfere with GH signaling.A negative association (? -.415, P < .005, linear regression model) of FGF21 levels with the change in SD score for length was found. In primary chondrocytes, FGF21 upregulated basal and GH-induced SOCS2 expression and inhibited GH-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation as well as GH-induced COLII and ALP expression. Finally, FGF21 inhibited GH-induced IGF-1 expression and cell proliferation, indicating GH resistance. However, FGF21 did not affect IGF-1-induced cell proliferation.Elevated FGF21 serum levels during the first weeks of life are independently associated with postnatal growth failure in preterm infants. Furthermore, our data provide mechanistic insights into GH resistance secondary to prematurity and may offer an explanation for the growth failure commonly seen in chronic conditions of childhood.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
