{"id":34619,"title":"A painless neck swelling and von Recklinghausen.","abstract":"Von Recklinghausen's disease, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, may occasionally present with unusual localizations of neurofibromas.A 46-year old woman, known with Von Recklinghausen's disease, reported a swelling and a feeling of pressure and globus sensation. Clinical examination revealed multiple large nodi on the right side of the neck. Laboratory testing including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal. An MRI showed a 1 x 3 x 10 centimeter sausage-like structure compressing the right jugular vein. At surgical exploration a string-like tumour firmly attached to the right vagal and recurrent laryngeal nerve was found. The tumor and both nerves were macroscopically curative resected. Histopathological examination demonstrated a plexiform cervical vagus nerve neurofibroma without malignancy.Patients with Von Recklinghausen's disease presenting with painless neck swellings may harbour cranial nerve neurofibromas.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720147","annotations":[{"name":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Vagus nerve","weight":0.857279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Cranial nerve","weight":0.821325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerve"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.781042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.779936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.620004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Neurofibroma","weight":0.616834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibroma"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.55696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.39873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.313868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.146624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Laryngeal nerve","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Daniel_von_Recklinghausen"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"}]}
