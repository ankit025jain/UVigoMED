{"id":29244,"title":"Immunoglobulin G in IgE-mediated allergy and allergen-specific immunotherapy.","abstract":"Allergen-specific IgG antibodies play a significant role in allergen-specific tolerance, either naturally induced or generated by specific immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are still debated, and allergen-specific IgG determinations are not recommended as a diagnostic tool in IgE-mediated allergy. This review summarizes the latest findings on the immunological and diagnostic role of IgG antibodies in respiratory and food allergies, and during allergen-specific immunotherapy.
