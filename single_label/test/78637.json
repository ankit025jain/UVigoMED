{"id":78637,"title":"40-Hz multiple auditory steady-state responses to narrow-band chirps in sedated and anaesthetized infants.","abstract":"The general consensus to date has been that a stimulus repetition rate of 40Hz is not appropriate for the recording of auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) in sedated or anaesthetized infants. The aim of this study was to investigate whether reliable 40-Hz ASSR thresholds can be obtained in sedated infants using narrow-band chirp stimuli in the clinical routine.40-Hz auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and 40-Hz ASSR were recorded in 34 infants below the age of 48 months under sedation or under general anaesthesia. ABR were evoked by broad-band chirp stimuli with a flat amplitude spectrum. ASSR were recorded simultaneously from both ears with an adaptive multiple stimulus paradigm using four narrow-band chirps centred at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000Hz. ABR and ASSR thresholds were evaluated to determine differences between the estimates from the two methods.Despite of sedation and anaesthesia, large wave V amplitudes of the chirp evoked 40-Hz ABR were found at levels as low as 10dB above the individual ABR threshold. ASSR thresholds for stimulus repetition rates of 40Hz could be consistently estimated in all 34 infants. Thresholds estimated from the ASSR for the four frequencies of the narrow-band chirps and the threshold derived from the broad-band chirp ABR differ, on average by 3.7dB for the frequency range of 1000-2000Hz and 7.1dB for the frequency range from 2000 to 4000Hz.In contrast to the general assumption that 40-Hz ASSR are not appropriate for threshold estimation in infants our results demonstrate that multiple ASSR with a stimulus repetition rate of 40Hz can be recorded in sedated and anaesthetized infants using narrow-band chirps. Threshold estimates obtained with 40-Hz ASSR are, on average, slightly higher than those obtained with chirp evoked ABR but allow for a frequency specific characterisation of the hearing ability.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613039","annotations":[{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.814794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.628222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.587655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.349287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Narrowband","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Bird vocalization","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vocalization"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Chirp","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0254237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"},{"name":"Sensory threshold","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_threshold"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Sedative","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Broadband","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Probability amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude"},{"name":"Thresholds","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholds"},{"name":"Repetition (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_(music)"}]}
