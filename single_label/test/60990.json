{"id":60990,"title":"Cytogenetic risk stratification of 417 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia from a single institution.","abstract":"Approximately 30% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) have karyotypic abnormalities and this low frequency has made using cytogenetic data for the prognostication of CMML patients challenging. Recently, a three-tiered cytogenetic risk stratification system for CMML patients has been proposed by a Spanish study group. Here we assessed the prognostic impact of cytogenetic abnormalities on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in 417 CMML patients from our institution. Overall, the Spanish cytogenetic risk effectively stratified patients into different risk groups, with a median OS of 33 months in the low-, 24 months in intermediate- and 14 months in the high-risk groups. Within the proposed high risk group, however, marked differences in OS were observed. Patients with isolated trisomy 8 showed a median OS of 22 months, similar to the intermediate-risk group (P?=?0.132), but significantly better than other patients in the high-risk group (P?=?0.018). Furthermore, patients with more than three chromosomal abnormalities showed a significantly shorter OS compared with patients with three abnormalities (8 vs. 15 months, P?=?0.004), suggesting possible a separate risk category. If we simply moved trisomy 8 to the intermediate risk category, the modified cytogenetic grouping would provide a better separation of OS and LFS; and its prognostic impact was independent of other risk parameters. Our study results strongly advocate for the incorporation of cytogenetic information in the risk model for CMML.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782398","annotations":[{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.581849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.415083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Trisomy 8","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_8"},{"name":"Continuous Media Markup Language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Media_Markup_Language"},{"name":"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelomonocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Divination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Independent school (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Advocate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"},{"name":"Low frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_frequency"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Separatism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism"},{"name":"Railways Act 1921","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railways_Act_1921"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Risk modeling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_modeling"}]}
