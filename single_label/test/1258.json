{"id":1258,"title":"Use of gated myocardial perfusion imaging to assess clinical value of xinmailong injection in chronic congestive heart failure.","abstract":"This study used gated myocardial perfusion imaging (G-MPI) to assess the clinical value of Xinmailong injection in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF).A total of 102 CHF patients were randomly divided into the control group (n = 51) and the Xinmailong group (n = 51). Patients in the control group were routinely treated. Patients in the Xinmailong group were additionally treated with Xinmailong injection in addition to routine treatment. Before and 3 months after treatment, G-MPI was used to determine changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV). Fourteen days after treatment, changes in plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were determined.Before treatment, there were no significant differences in LVEF, LVEDV, LVESV, and BNP levels between the two groups (all P > 0.05). After treatment, LVEDV, LVESV, and BNP levels were significantly lower, and LVEF was significantly higher in the Xinmailong group than in the control group (all P < 0.05).Additional use of Xinmailong injection in addition to routine treatment improves cardiac function of CHF patients. Because of the safety and effectiveness of Xinmailong injection; this therapy should be promoted.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417405","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.862614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brain natriuretic peptide","weight":0.780709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.581773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.409949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.351284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
