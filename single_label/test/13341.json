{"id":13341,"title":"Vaccination of sows against type 2 Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) before artificial insemination protects against type 2 PRRSV challenge but does not protect against type 1 PRRSV challenge in late gestation.","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of the commercially available type 2 Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV)-based modified live vaccine against type 1 and type 2 PRRSV challenge in pregnant sows. Half of the sows in the study were vaccinated with a type 2 PRRSV-based vaccine 4 weeks prior to artificial insemination while the other half remained non-vaccinated. Sows were then challenged intranasally with type 1 or type 2 PRRSV at 93 days of gestation. The sows which received the type 2 PRRSV-based vaccine followed by type 2 PRRSV challenge had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against type 2 PRRSV than they did against type 1 PRRSV. These same sows had higher frequencies of IFN-?-secreting cells when stimulated with type 2 PRRSV compared to those stimulated with type 1 PRRSV. Subsequent virological evaluation demonstrated that the type 2 PRRSV-based vaccine reduced the type 2 PRRSV load but not the type 1 PRRSV load present in the blood of the sows. Additionally, vaccination of pregnant sows with the type 2 PRRSV-based vaccine effectively reduced the level of type 2 PRRSV nucleic acids observed in fetal tissues from type 2 PRRSV-challenged sows but did not reduce the level of type 1 PRRSV nucleic acid observed in fetal tissues from type 1 PRRSV-challenged sows. This study demonstrates that the vaccination of pregnant sows with the type 2 PRRSV-based vaccine protects against type 2 PRRSV challenge but does not protect against type 1 PRRSV challenge.
