{"id":73406,"title":"[Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of bone metastases].","abstract":"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy can deliver high doses of bone metastases while sparing adjacent healthy tissue not only for a decompressive or analgesic purpose, but also to improve the local control of the irradiated region. Various phases I or II studies showed the feasibility of such an approach at the cost of limited toxicity, including during re-irradiation. Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to oligometastases may also improve the long-term control of metastatic disease.
