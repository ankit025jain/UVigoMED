{"id":70669,"title":"Posttraumatic growth and hope in parents of children with cancer.","abstract":"Posttraumatic growth (PTG), a positive change in values and major life goals experienced as a result of the struggle with a highly challenging life circumstance, has been shown to be related to the construct of hope, the belief that goals can be met. To date, no studies have examined the relationship between PTG and hope in parents of children with cancer. Participants were parents (N = 85) of children and adolescents (ages 2-18 years, M = 7.72 years) receiving treatment for cancer. Parents completed a demographic questionnaire, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), and Hope Scale (HS). Hope was found to be related to PTG in parents of children with cancer, with higher levels of hope associated with greater PTG. Exploratory analyses on the subscales of the PTGI revealed that hope was also related to higher scores on the Relating to Others, New Possibilities, Personal Strength, and Appreciation of Life subscales. Spiritual change was not related to hope in parents.Findings suggest that experiencing hope during the pediatric cancer experience may facilitate posttraumatic growth in parents. The construct of hope may be an important target of intervention for promoting positive adjustment in this population.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158296","annotations":[{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.056379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0362083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Appreciation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appreciation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Physical strength","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_strength"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Hope","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Possibilities","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possibilities"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
