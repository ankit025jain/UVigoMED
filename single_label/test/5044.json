{"id":5044,"title":"[Structure and specific diagnostic features of neurologic deficiencies in patients with maxillofacial injuries admitted to Stavropol Maxillofacial Surgery Unit].","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the structure of maxillofacial trauma associated with brain injury in Stavropol to elaborate the diagnostic approach. We analyzed 2,604 case records of patients with maxillofacial trauma in the Stavropol region in the period from 2008 to 2012. Only 345 (13.2%) cases were diagnosed with maxillofacial trauma associated with mild brain injury. The analysis of case records showed that the incidence of brain damage depends on the location and type of fracture of the facial bones. It is noted that emotional and stress factors often mask neurological symptoms that are important in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury. To ensure the treatment success and reduce the duration of disability patients with maxillofacial trauma must be provided with special treatment with a more thorough analysis of possible neurological deficit followed by mandatory therapy for neurological symptoms.
