{"id":56357,"title":"Acute Idiopathic Endotheliitis Early After Corneal Cross-linking With Riboflavin and Ultraviolet-A.","abstract":"To present a case of acute idiopathic endotheliitis occurred early after corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) for progressive keratoconus, and to discuss possible risk factors, causes, and other similar complications in the literature.A 24-year-old woman with bilateral keratoconus underwent a corneal de-epithelization and subsequently CXL in the right eye, which was performed with the application of 0.1% riboflavin with 20% dextran, and exposure to ultraviolet-A light (370 nm, 2.9-3.1 mW/cm) for 30 minutes. A bandage contact lens was placed until complete re-epithelialization. Postoperatively, the patient received 0.5% topical moxifloxacin (3 times a day) and preservative free artificial tears (6 times a day).Postoperatively, the patient presented with significant hyperemia and photophobia on day 3. On biomicroscopy, ring-shaped endothelial infiltrates and localized corneal edema were observed in the inferior paracentral location of the cornea. Idiopathic endotheliitis was diagnosed, the therapeutic contact lens was removed, and 1% prednisolone acetate suspension was started every hour in addition to hypertonic ophthalmic solution every 3 hours. After this intensive corticosteroid treatment, the infiltrates improved and completely resolved after 1 week.We reported a successfully treated acute idiopathic endotheliitis occurring early after routine CXL. This very rare complication is hypothesized to occur as a result of the phototoxic effect of ultraviolet-A transmission on the corneal endothelium, or as an inflammatory response to surgical trauma or solutions used throughout the procedure.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699560","annotations":[{"name":"Photophobia","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophobia"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.867477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Hyperaemia","weight":0.849748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaemia"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.843373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Moxifloxacin","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxifloxacin"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.814608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Corneal endothelium","weight":0.794885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_endothelium"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.564559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preservative","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preservative"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.458029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Bandage","weight":0.440988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.408763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.396238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.323438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.224285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.149224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dextran","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextran"},{"name":"Phototoxicity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototoxicity"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Artificial tears","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_tears"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
