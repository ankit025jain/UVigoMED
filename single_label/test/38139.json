{"id":38139,"title":"[Residual relaxant block due to pseudocholinesterase deficiency - First manifestation in an elderly patient].","abstract":"Pseudocholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inactivates the relaxant drugs mivacurium and suxamethonium. A deficiency in plasma activity of this enzyme may result in prolonged muscular paralysis and subsequently the need for an extended duration of mechanical ventilation. We report the case of a 65-year-old patient who was diagnosed with butyrylcholinesterase deficiency for the first time during elective surgery. Neuromuscular monitoring constitutes a central diagnostic asset in ensuring patient safety.
