{"id":92157,"title":"Histological changes in thalamus in short term survivors following traumatic brain injury: an autopsy study.","abstract":"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Reduction of thalamic volumes were seen in upto 80% of patients who survived for more than 3 months after TBI. However, the same may not be true in patients who died earlier following TBI.To to study the thalamus for evidence of any injury in short term survivors of TBI (<5 days) using immunohistochemistry to look for evidence of acute thalamic injury.A cross sectional prospective study was done in which autopsy specimens of short term survivors of TBI (<5 days) were studied for histopathological changes.A total of 16 patients with a mean age of 37.8 years were included in the study. CT scan revealed acute subdural haematoma in 10, contusions in 4 patients, extradural haematoma and depressed fracture in 1 each, and diffuse axonal injury in 1 patient. Seven patients required surgery in the form of a decompressive hemicraniectomy. The histopathological analysis of the bilateral thalami showed evidence of congestion of the cerebral capillaries in 8 patients. Axonal retraction balls were seen in 8 patients, myelin breakdown products were seen in 14 patients and axonal swelling was seen in 14 patients.Thalamic injury is universal in the setting of severe TBI in patients who have decreased survival and may be a significant factor for the poor outcome in these patients.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441326","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Diffuse axonal injury","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_axonal_injury"},{"name":"Thalamus","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Epidural hematoma","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural_hematoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.206725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.162553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0975413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"}]}
