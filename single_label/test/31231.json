{"id":31231,"title":"Factors associated with recent symptoms of an injection site infection or injury among people who inject drugs in three English cities.","abstract":"People who inject drugs (PWID) are at risk of injection site infections and injuries. The factors associated with recent symptoms of these problems are examined.PWID recruited using respondent driven sampling, underwent a computer-assisted interview and provided a dried-blood spot sample. Weight data were examined using logistic regression.The mean age of the 855 participants was 32 years, and 25% were women. During the preceding 28 days, 94% had injected heroin and 50% crack-cocaine; with 41% injecting into their arms and 47% their groin. The passing on of used needles/syringes was reported by 9.7% and receiving by 8.0%. During the preceding 28 days, 21% reported having redness, swelling and tenderness, 6.1% an abscess, and 5.2% a sore/open wound at an injection site; with a quarter (24%) reporting one or more of these. A range of factors were associated with these symptoms; all three symptoms were associated with more frequent injection and the use of multiple injection sites; two of the symptoms were also associated with having recently overdosed and the use of particular injection sites.Injection site infections and injuries are common among PWID and targeted interventions are needed to reduce risk.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388664","annotations":[{"name":"Drug","weight":0.787462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.653763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.378259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.23901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Groin","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"855","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/855"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Tenderness (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderness_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
