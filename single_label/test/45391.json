{"id":45391,"title":"Reproducibility studies for experimental epitope detection in macrophages (EDIM).","abstract":"We have recently described epitope detection in macrophages (EDIM) by flow cytometry. This is a promising tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of malignancies. However, biological and technical validation is warranted before clinical applicability can be explored.The pre-analytic and analytic phases were investigated. Five different aspects were assessed: blood sample stability, intra-individual variability in healthy persons, intra-assay variation, inter-assay variation and assay transferability. The post-analytic phase was already partly standardized and described in an earlier study.The outcomes in the pre-analytic phase showed that samples are stable for 24h after venipuncture. Biological variation over time was similar to that of serum tumor marker assays; each patient has a baseline value. Intra-assay variation showed good reproducibility, while inter-assay variation showed reproducibility similar to that of to established serum tumor marker assays. Furthermore, the assay showed excellent transferability between analyzers.Under optimal analytic conditions the EDIM method is technically stable, reproducible and transferable. Biological variation over time needs further assessment in future work.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685835","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.621073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.610337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.598826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.307034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bird species new to science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_species_new_to_science"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"Transferability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferability"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Postanalytic philosophy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postanalytic_philosophy"}]}
