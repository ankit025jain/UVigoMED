{"id":30927,"title":"Cutaneous reactions in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with peginterferon and ribavirin.","abstract":"Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin could cause various cutaneous reactions. Treatment-related cutaneous reactions are common, and treatable complications can contribute to the treatment discontinuation.We performed a 6-year prospective study of cutaneous reactions in 271 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with peginterferon and ribavirin.Cutaneous reactions of mild to moderate degree were seen in 36 (13.3%) patients: localized cutaneous reactions in 7 (2.6%) patients, generalized reactions - pruritus, skin xerosis and eczematous changes - in 28 (10.3%) patients, alopecia in 11 (4.1%) patients; exacerbation of lichen planus was seen in 1 patient.The study showed a relatively low prevalence of cutaneous reactions without the need for discontinuation of any of the drugs used. These reactions correlated only with the age of the patients and treatment duration. This finding is of particular importance with regard to the recently introduced direct-acting antivirals in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, which can cause a very severe form of cutaneous reactions.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434490","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Lichen planus","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_planus"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.445022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.294048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lichen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"},{"name":"Xerosis cutis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerosis_cutis"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
