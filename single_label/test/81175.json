{"id":81175,"title":"Emergence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka 2008-2011.","abstract":"To report cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka.The study population included all patients with CL reported from Polonnaruwa district from January 2008 through April 2012. Data were collected in the dermatology unit of Polonnaruwa General Hospital and the regional epidemiology unit of Polonnaruwa.Four hundred and forty six patients with leishmaniasis were detected; clinical details were available for 362. Mean annual incidence of leishmaniasis between 2008 and 2012 in Polonnaruwa district was 26.2 per 100,000. The case incidence steadily increased during the study period. Case distribution by month peaked between August and November. Cases were geographically clustered in three administrative divisions with a mean annual incidence ranging from 94.7 to 54.1 per 100,000 population. Significantly more (n = 294, 65.9%) males than females were affected (?(2) for goodness of fit = 48.4, P < 0.001). The commonest type of lesion was nodules (n = 157, 43.4%) followed by crust (n = 116, 32.0%). The majority of patients had lesions on upper limbs (n = 144, 39.8%) or the face (n = 117, 32.3%).Cutaneous leishmaniasis is increasing in Polonnaruwa, with clear spatial and temporal clustering. Sri Lanka needs more vigilant leishmaniasis surveillance.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438012","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Crust (geology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Polonnaruwa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonnaruwa"},{"name":"Goodness of fit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit"},{"name":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sri Lanka","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"362","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/362"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Sri","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri"},{"name":"Division (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(military)"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Good and evil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"}]}
