{"id":55850,"title":"Gray hyper-reflective subretinal exudative lesions in exudative age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of ranibizumab 0.5 mg on gray hyper-reflective subretinal lesions diagnosed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Retrospective interventional study.Data from 28 consecutive patients affected with neovascular AMD that presented subretinal hyper-reflective lesions as visualized by SD OCT were collected. Gray hyper-reflective subretinal lesion characteristics were analyzed before and after intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg injection.Thirty eyes of 28 patients (5 male, 23 female, aged 57-91 years) were included. At study entry, gray lesion was associated with exudative features in 24 of 30 eyes (80%), including subretinal fluid (SRF) in 20 of 30 eyes (67%) and retinal cystoid spaces in 11 of 30 eyes (37%). Twenty-four eyes with exudative features at study entry received prompt treatment; 6 eyes without exudative features at study entry received deferred treatment (after 1 month observation), when exudative signs emerged (SRF in 3/6 eyes and retinal cystoid spaces in 5/6 eyes). Ninety-three percent of the gray lesions responded to ranibizumab treatment at 2 months and 77% at 6 months. Gray hyper-reflective subretinal lesion thickness was significantly reduced after treatment at both 2 months (from 482±116 ?m to 367±102 ?m, P<.0001) and 6 months (from 482±116 ?m to 369±71 ?m, P<.0001).Our findings suggest that gray hyper-reflective subretinal lesions might be considered as a qualitative criterion for retreatment of exudative AMD. They may represent an early sign of active choroidal neovascularization, and should prompt to early treatment.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794284","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.891685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.472445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.35871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.279407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.22095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.146652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0745664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Cystoids","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoids"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Self-Realization Fellowship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Realization_Fellowship"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"}]}
