{"id":87972,"title":"Role of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin in functional outcome after concussive brain injury in mice.","abstract":"Akt (protein kinase B) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cell death and cognitive outcome after cerebral contusion in mice; however, a role for Akt/mTOR in concussive brain injury has not been well characterized. In a mouse closed head injury (CHI) concussion traumatic brain injury (TBI) model, phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt), mTOR (p-mTOR), and S6RP (p-S6RP) was increased by 24?hours in cortical and hippocampal brain homogenates (P<0.05 versus sham for each), and p-S6RP was robustly induced in IBA-1+ microglia and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP+) astrocytes. Pretreatment with inhibitors of Akt or mTOR individually by the intracerebroventricular route reduced phosphorylation of their respective direct substrates FOXO1 (P<0.05) or S6RP (P<0.05) after CHI, confirming the activity of inhibitors. Rapamycin pretreatment significantly worsened hidden platform (P<0.01) and probe trial (P<0.05) performance in CHI mice. Intracerebroventricular administration of necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) before CHI increased hippocampal Akt and S6RP phosphorylation and improved place learning (probe trials, P<0.001 versus vehicle), whereas co-administration of rapamycin or Akt inhibitor with Nec-1 eliminated improved probe trial performance. These data suggest a beneficial role for Akt/mTOR signaling after concussion TBI independent of cell death that may contribute to improved outcome by Nec-1.
