{"id":33958,"title":"[Diagnosis and prognosis of fetal ebstein anomaly].","abstract":"Fetal echocardiography is possible to confirm with great certainty the diagnosis, in utero, Ebstein's anomaly, as well as determine its perinatal prognosis.Review the experience of 16 cases diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly, using fetal echocardiography, analyzing \"forecast echocardiographic parameters\" set by Pavlova, Huhta and Barre.retrospective and descriptive analysis. We analysed echocardiographic parameters and its correlation with the perinatal development of 16 cases diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly.Maternal age of our patients was 27.94 +/- 5.7 years, gestational age 31.3 +/- 3.6.) Mortality: in-utero 37.5% (n = 6), neonatal 50% (n = 8), survived 12.5% (n = 2). Cardiothoracic index 0.61 +/- 0.074, relationship foramen oval/heart atrial 0.6 +/- 0.015; obstruction to the way out of the right ventricle in 14 cases (87.5%). The deceased 81% presented degree of valvular displacement > 2.5; relationship RV/LV 2.24 +/- 0.37).Cardiothoracic index fetal stage > 0.55, relationship oval foramen/interatrial septum < 0.3, obstruction to the way out and a degree of valvular displacement > 2.5, absence of back flow in arteriosus ductus and a ratio RV/LV > 2 are poor prognostic factors for Ebstein's anomaly.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779265","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.797443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.735475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.707504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"In utero","weight":0.661495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_utero"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.470812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.460792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.392115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.35184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0779046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0508816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Cardiothoracic surgery","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiothoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Foramen ovale (heart)","weight":0.0340852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen_ovale_(heart)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Advanced maternal age","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Forecasting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Oval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Pavlova (food)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlova_(food)"},{"name":"Certainty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty"}]}
