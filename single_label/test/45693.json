{"id":45693,"title":"[Expression of plasma miR-106a in colorectal cancer and its clinical significance].","abstract":"To detect plasma miR-106a level in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and analyze its correlation to the clinicopathological features and disease diagnosis.miRNA expression profiling was performed using miRNA microarray chip for 3 colorectal adenocarcinoma samples and matched normal tissues. Plasma samples was collected from 50 colorectal cancer patients for quantitative analysis of miR-106a using real-time RT-PCR using 47 plasma samples from healthy volunteer as the control. Forty plasma samples were collected from these patients 7 days after operation to examine the changes in miR-106a expression.miR-106a was differentially expressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma compared to normal tissues. The plasma levels of miR-106a expression were significantly higher in the cancer patients than in the healthy control group (P=0.012). miR-106a expression significantly decreased after the operation compared with its preoperative level (P<0.01), and no correlation was found between preoperative plasma miR-106a and the clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P>0.05). miR-106a showed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of 66.1%, a sensitivity of 62.3%, and a specificity of 68.2% in discriminating colorectal cancer patients from the control subjects.plasma miR-106a is up-regulated in CRC patients, suggesting its potential value for the diagnosis of CRC.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670448","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.715553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.699349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.668405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.644486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.516807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.337526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.140403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0182456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"}]}
