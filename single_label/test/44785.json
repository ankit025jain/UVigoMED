{"id":44785,"title":"Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with complete mesocolic excision.","abstract":"Complete mesocolic excision (CME) has recently been reemphasized as a technical approach for anatomical dissection during colon cancer surgery. Although a laparoscopic approach for right colon cancer is performed frequently, identifying an adequate dissection plane is not always easy. In our practice, the patient lies in a modified lithotomy position. The first step is ileocolic area mobilization, followed by adequate retraction of the cecum laterally. This procedure enables discrimination of the ileocolic vessels and superior mesenteric vessels. Importantly, this method facilitates identification of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), followed by the identification of the root of ileocolic pedicles. After that, sharp dissection along the SMV in an upward direction helps to safely identify the middle colic artery (MCA). Dissection then continues to the level of the origin of MCA, after which the right branch of MCA can be divided.A total of 128 consecutive patients (63 males) who underwent laparoscopic CME for right colon cancer by a single surgeon were analyzed in this study.There was no conversion to open surgery. The median operation time was 192 min (interquartile range [IQR] 118-363 min). The median proximal and distal resection margins were 11 and 10 cm, respectively. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 28 (IQR 3-88). There were six postoperative complications (4.6 %). The median hospital stay was 5 days (IQR 4-37 days). The video demonstrates a laparoscopic CME for a patient who had advanced distal ascending colon cancer.In conclusion, identifying the anatomical location of the SMV and performing meticulous dissection along the SMV is an essential procedure for containing all potential routes of metastatic tumors. Initial ileocecal mobilization with adequate counter traction of the cecum may be useful for novice surgeons attempting to identify the location of SMV during laparoscopic CME for right colon cancer.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718666","annotations":[{"name":"Superior mesenteric vein","weight":0.89151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_vein"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Middle colic artery","weight":0.841204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_colic_artery"},{"name":"Ascending colon","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_colon"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.774507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.741068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.655657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.587785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.583495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.514532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.505198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Ileocolic artery","weight":0.381356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileocolic_artery"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.301989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.296074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Horse colic","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_colic"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Lithotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotomy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"}]}
