{"id":7349,"title":"Newcastle disease in captive falcons in the Middle East: a review of clinical and pathologic findings.","abstract":"Newcastle disease is an important viral disease of falcons in the Middle East. Two different clinical presentations producing distinct clinical symptoms and pathologic lesions have been identified in affected falcons, denoted as neurotropic velogenic and viscerotropic velogenic forms. Humoral response after vaccination with commercially available oil-emulsion inactivated poultry vaccines has been observed for up to 9 months in vaccinated falcons. Public awareness programs at falcon medical facilities in the region are needed to promote annual vaccinations to prevent Newcastle disease in falcons.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881147","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.772014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.595181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Neurotropic virus","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotropic_virus"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Newcastle disease","weight":0.0822457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_disease"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Falcon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon"},{"name":"Medical facility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_facility"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Newcastle upon Tyne","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"}]}
