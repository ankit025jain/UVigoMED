{"id":79248,"title":"Gene expression pattern of Treg and TCR V? subfamily T cells before and after specific immunotherapy in allergic rhinitis.","abstract":"T regulatory cell (Treg) plays a critical role in respiratory allergy and allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), and ?? T cells might participate in mediating Treg quantity and/or function in some immunological diseases. To further characterize whether ?? T cells could influence Treg in allergic rhinitis (AR) and SIT, we investigated the expression pattern of Treg's Foxp3 gene and ?? T cell receptor (TCR) V? subfamily genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AR patients before and after SIT.Eighteen AR patients undergoing effective SIT with house dust mite extract for one year were recruited. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was applied to evaluate the severity. Immunofluorescence quantification analysis was performed to determine the serum specific IgE (sIgE) content. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression levels of Foxp3 and TCR V? subfamilies. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited as the controls.Nasal uni-VAS score after SIT was significantly lower than that before SIT, while serum sIgE content was similar before and after SIT. Expression levels of Foxp3 and TCR V? subfamilies in AR patients before treatment were significantly lower than those in healthy subjects. Expression levels of V?I and II were similar before and after SIT, while expression levels of Foxp3 and V?III after SIT were significantly higher than those before. Before SIT, the significant positive correlation was observed between expression levels of Foxp3 and V?I, II, III, while negative correlation was observed between Foxp3, V?III and VAS. After SIT, the significant positive correlation between expression levels of Foxp3 and V?III and negative correlation between Foxp3, V?III and VAS were observed.Treg and V? subfamily T cells were in a dynamic equilibrium in AR patients before and after effective immunotherapy for one year. The early improvement of symptoms following immunotherapy might be independent of the serum sIgE content in AR patients, but associated with the reconstitution of T cell immunity.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460842","annotations":[{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.860107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.82342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.748529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.738291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.705769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.695533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.527961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.426113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.409501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.370331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"House dust mite","weight":0.335221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dust_mite"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.295927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.179457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Dynamic equilibrium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_equilibrium"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
