{"id":26315,"title":"[Research advances on roles of ADAMTS-13 in thrombotic diseases].","abstract":"ADAMTS-13 is a plasma metalloprotease that cleaves von willebrand factor (vWF).At the present,it has been made great progresses on its structure, biological characteristics and function. ADAMTS-13 plays an important role in artery and venous thrombosis,besides controlling the cleaving of vWF, and the activity of the ADAMTS-13 can be effected by ion concentration and thrombin signal transduction pathway,but how the mechanism of ADAMTS-13 controlled is still not clear. This article reviews ADAMTS-13 changes,relevant mechanism and influencing factors of the enzyme regulation.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130850","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.824742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.663186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.634601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.624281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.516713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.499628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.466895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.335418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.325517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.242222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Von Willebrand factor","weight":0.234543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"ADAMTS","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAMTS"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"ADAMTS13","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAMTS13"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
