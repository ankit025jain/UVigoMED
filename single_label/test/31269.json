{"id":31269,"title":"Protection against paraoxon toxicity by an intravenous pretreatment with polyethylene-glycol-conjugated recombinant butyrylcholinesterase in macaques.","abstract":"Recombinant (r) butyrylcholinesterase (rBChE) produced in CHO cells is being developed as a prophylactic countermeasure against neurotoxicity resulting from exposure to organophosphates (OPs) in the form of pesticides and nerve agents. To evaluate the efficacy of a parenteral pretreatment, a PEGylated macaque (Ma) form of rBChE was administered into homologous animals to ensure good plasma retention without immunogenicity. Thus, macaques were administered PEG-rMaBChE at either 5 or 7mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) and exposed subcutaneously to 12?g/kg of the potent pesticide paraoxon (Px) at 1h or at 1 and 72h, respectively. Protection was measured by the ability of rBChE prophylaxis to prevent the inhibition of circulating acetylcholinesterase on red blood cells (RBC-AChE). In rBChE-pretreated animals, no inhibition of RBC-AChE activity after the first Px exposure and only a 10-20% reduction after the second exposure were observed as compared to a 75% RBC-AChE inhibition usually obtained without pretreatment. In addition, these studies raised other interesting issues. The lipophilic nature of Px, appears to result in early and transient inhibition of RBC-AChE as a result of transfer of OP bound to RBC even in BChE-pretreated animals. The protection by a single injection of rBChE against two administrations of Px represents the first example of protection by an i.v. rBChE pretreatment against a pesticide such as Px and bodes well for a parenteral rHuBChE pretreatment as an OP countermeasure in humans.
