{"id":90469,"title":"The contribution of rib fractures to chronic pain and disability.","abstract":"The contribution of rib fractures to chronic pain and disability is not well described.Two hundred three patients with rib fractures were followed for 6Â months. Chronic pain was assessed using the McGill Pain Questionnaire Pain Rating Index and Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scales. Disability was defined as a decrease in work or functional status.The prevalence of chronic pain was 22% and disability was 53%. Acute PPI predicted chronic pain. Associated injuries, bilateral rib fractures, injury severity score, and number of rib fractures were not predictive of chronic pain. No acute injury characteristics were predictive of disability. Among 89 patients with isolated rib fractures, the prevalence of chronic pain was 28% and of disability was 40%. No injury characteristics predicted chronic pain. Bilateral rib fractures and acute PPI predicted disability.The contribution of rib fractures to chronic pain and disability is significant but unpredictable with conventional injury descriptors.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612969","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.615556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.387328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.231498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"McGill Pain Questionnaire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_Pain_Questionnaire"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Rib fracture","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_fracture"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"McGill University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
