{"id":83517,"title":"[Superior horn of thyroid cartilage dysplasia in 1 case].","abstract":"The external stimuli and other reasons may result in hyperplasia and abnormal angle of the upper corner of the thyroid cartilage. The upper corner of the thyroid cartilage has anatomical variations. To oppression stimulate carotid artery, cervical sympathetic dry section and so on, could causing pharyngeal foreign body sensation and sore throat. By surgical removal of the thyroid cartilage hyperplasia upper corner, postoperative symptoms would be resolved.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330655","annotations":[{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Thyroid cartilage","weight":0.813825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cartilage"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.733991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.708387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.494766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.379206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Sore throat","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Externality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"},{"name":"Oppression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression"},{"name":"Horn (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)"}]}
