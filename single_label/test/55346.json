{"id":55346,"title":"Effects of Feldenkrais method on chronic neck/scapular pain in people with visual impairment: a randomized controlled trial with one-year follow-up.","abstract":"To determine whether the Feldenkrais method is an effective intervention for chronic neck/scapular pain in patients with visual impairment.Randomized controlled trial with an untreated control group.Low vision center.Patients (N=61) with visual impairment (mean, 53.3 y) and nonspecific chronic (mean, 23.8 y) neck/scapular pain.Participants were randomly assigned to the Feldenkrais method group (n=30) or untreated control group (n=31). Patients in the treatment group underwent one 2-hour Feldenkrais method session per week for 12 consecutive weeks.Blind assessment of perceived pain (visual analog scale [VAS]) during physical therapist palpation of the left and right occipital, upper trapezius, and levator scapulae muscle areas; self-assessed degree of pain on the Visual, Musculoskeletal, and Balance Complaints questionnaire; and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey bodily pain scale.Patients undergoing Feldenkrais method reported significantly less pain than the controls according to the VAS and Visual, Musculoskeletal, and Balance Complaints questionnaire ratings at posttreatment follow-up and 1-year follow-up. There were no significant differences regarding the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey bodily pain scale ratings.Feldenkrais method is an effective intervention for chronic neck/scapular pain in patients with visual impairment.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Eye
