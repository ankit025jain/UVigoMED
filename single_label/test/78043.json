{"id":78043,"title":"Function of the audiovestibular system in children with systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"Systemic lupus erythematosus can affect inner ear by disrupting either the hearing or balance system. Affection of hearing can be anatomically categorized into conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, while affection of the equilibrium system manifests either as an isolated manifestation like vertigo or as a part of a spectrum like Meniere's disease. Most cases show asymptomatic affection requiring an objective audiovestibular assessment. More focus should be given to routine evaluation especially with disease flares and for proper treatment. In pediatric patients, more concern should be given owing to the added effect of ototoxicity with several drugs and the educational impact of such comorbidity.
