{"id":69779,"title":"[Mapping of the key oncology indicators available in France].","abstract":"Available data in the field of oncology in France are scattered due to the large number of available indicators and their sources. In order to facilitate identification and analysis of these indicators, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) has mapped the main indicators available in oncology.Mapping was based on the needs of various categories of potential users. Standardized interviews were conducted face-to-face or by email among representatives to determine their needs and expectations. The underlying data sources were also identified: databases, national surveys, websites. A first selection of indicators was proposed in the report entitled \"La situation du cancer en France en 2009\" (\"The state of cancer in France in 2009\") and was expanded. Data collection concerning indicators was performed among INCa correspondents for each theme.Several themes were defined: epidemiology, prevention and risk factors, screening, medical demography, health care offer, living conditions, costs and expenses, research. Data were classified according to: geographical coverage, age, gender, type of cancer, occupational categories. This information was collected for each indicator selected and was made available via the cancer data website (http://lesdonnees.e-cancer.fr).The available oncology indicators are numerous and scattered. Mapping can be a useful tool to facilitate access to these indicators. It should be regularly updated to reflect the most recent data.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291878","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.623657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.463986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"France","weight":0.4316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.422886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.346541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.227825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Email","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"},{"name":"French language","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"National Cancer Institute","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0193761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Data type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type"},{"name":"Correspondent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondent"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"}]}
