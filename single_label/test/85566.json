{"id":85566,"title":"Pulmonary artery thrombosis in a patient with right-sided heart failure.","abstract":"Pulmonary thromboembolism occurring either abruptly or insidious poses a greater challenge in diagnosis. A high index of suspicion is required to proceed with proper investigations in patients with nonspecific cardiac or respiratory presentation to make the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Early diagnosis of PE with prompt initiating of anticoagulation therapy has been proven to have a positive impact in mortality reduction associated with recurrent episodes of this condition. We present a case of a 76-year-old man, known to have cardiac failure on regular treatment who presented with predominant features of right-sided heart failure accompanied with dizziness. He was diagnosed to have pulmonary artery thrombosis by computerized tomography. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with marked clinical improvement.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909483","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.856973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.839472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.766547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.565244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.488693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.365507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Physical education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"}]}
