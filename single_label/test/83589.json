{"id":83589,"title":"[Age-associated reproductive cycle hypothalamic regulation impairment and its correction].","abstract":"This review covers present-day ideas of the female organism reproductive system neuroendocrine regulation in aging. The literature data on the key role of the hypothalamus in formation, organization and age-related decline of the reproductive function in both mammals and humans are considered in detail. Special focus is on catecholamines, peptides and other biologically active compounds acting in these processes. The authors discuss data showing interaction between the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus and the pineal gland synchronizing circadian and diurnal rhythms of gonadotropine-releasing hormone being normally synthesised and secreted during the reproductive period, but failing in aging or under the influence of neurotoxic compounds. Molecular mechanisms of ovarian cycle hypothalamic regulation impairment and possible ways of its correction by means of melatonin and peptide preparations from the pineal gland are described. The data presented may be of utility to prevent premature aging of reproductive function.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306659","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Pineal gland","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland"},{"name":"Suprachiasmatic nucleus","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.753881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.729365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Reproductive system","weight":0.694493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.558397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Neurotoxin","weight":0.402234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxin"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.364504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.358664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Diurnality","weight":0.346763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.292974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
