{"id":14995,"title":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) surveillance using pre-weaning oral fluid samples detects circulation of wild-type PRRSV.","abstract":"Oral fluid samples collected from litters of piglets (n=600) one day prior to weaning were evaluated as a method to surveil for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infections in four sow herds of approximately 12,500 sow each. Serum samples from the litters' dam (n=600) were included for comparison. All four herds were endemically infected with PRRSV and all sows had been vaccinated ? 2 times with PRRSV modified-live virus vaccines. After all specimens had been collected, samples were randomized and assayed by PRRSV real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and four PRRSV antibody ELISA assays (IgM, IgA, IgG, and Commercial Kit). All sow serum samples were negative by PRRSV RT-qPCR, but 9 of 600 oral fluid samples tested positive at two laboratories. Open reading frame 5 (ORF5) sequencing of 2 of the 9 positive oral fluid samples identified wild-type viruses as the source of the infection. A comparison of antibody responses in RT-qPCR positive vs. negative oral fluid samples showed significantly higher IgG S/P ratios in RT-qPCR-positive oral fluid samples (mean S/P 3.46 vs. 2.36; p=0.02). Likewise, sow serum samples from RT-qPCR-positive litter oral fluid samples showed significantly higher serum IgG (mean S/P 1.73 vs. 0.98; p<0.001) and Commercial Kit (mean S/P 1.97 vs. 0.98; p<0.001) S/P ratios. Overall, the study showed that pre-weaning litter oral fluid samples could provide an efficient and sensitive approach to surveil for PRRSV in infected, vaccinated, or presumed-negative pig breeding herds.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393634","annotations":[{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.781749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.631577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.476825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.468437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.463177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.446587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.399876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.132302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcine_Reproductive_and_Respiratory_Syndrome_Virus"},{"name":"Reading frame","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dam","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"}]}
