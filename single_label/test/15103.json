{"id":15103,"title":"[Effects of copper and zinc cations bound by gamma-globulin fraction in Staphylococcus aureus culture].","abstract":"AIM. Evaluation of Staphylococcus aureus culture growth dynamics in the presence of gamma-globulin: metal-complexes formed with copper and zinc cations as well as cations of metals used in isolation during the first 24 hours of exposition.. Samples of human gamma-globulin metal-complexes with copper or zinc cations at a final concentration of 0.5 microg/ml were introduced into S. aureus bacteria suspensions containing approximately 10(3) CFU/ml. Suspension at the volume of 5.0 ml was incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours with sampling and CFU calculation in the culture at various exposure periods. An accepted micromethod for determination of viability of bacteria was used.The protein transformed by copper cation binding realizes bacteriostatic activity in the logarithmic growth phase of S. aureus culture from 3.0 to 6.0 hours of incubation. Free copper cations inhibit bacterial reproduction at a higher degree than the metal-complex. The protein transformed by zinc cation binding realizes bacteriostatic activity at 1.5 hours of S. aureus incubation. Free zinc cations do not have bacteriostatic effect against S. aureus.Proteins of the gamma-globulin fraction in the range of physiological concentrations forming metal-complexes with copper and zinc cations may be factors that have cytostatic effect against S. aureus bacteria. Zinc cations realize bacteriostatic activity only in gamma-gloulin bound state whereas copper cations--also in the free state.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286505","annotations":[{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.839721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cation","weight":0.79859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.663194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.629877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.56142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.460274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.343097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.270876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.210637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Bacteriostatic agent","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriostatic_agent"},{"name":"Bacterial growth","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_growth"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Postgraduate education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
