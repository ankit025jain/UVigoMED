{"id":60715,"title":"CDX2 gene expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","abstract":"CDX genes are classically known as regulators of axial elongation during early embryogenesis. An unsuspected role for CDX genes has been revealed during hematopoietic development. The CDX gene family member CDX2 belongs to the most frequent aberrantly expressed proto-oncogenes in human acute leukemias and is highly leukemogenic in experimental models. We used reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the expression level of CDX2 gene in 30 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis and 30 healthy volunteers. ALL patients were followed up to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) on days 15 and 42 of induction. We found that CDX2 gene was expressed in 50% of patients and not expressed in controls. Associations between gene expression and different clinical and laboratory data of patients revealed no impact on different findings. With follow up, we could not confirm that CDX2 expression had a prognostic significance.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841154","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.680176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.679927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Embryogenesis","weight":0.588141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryogenesis"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.277186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.274121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.229769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Gene family","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_family"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"CDX2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDX2"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
