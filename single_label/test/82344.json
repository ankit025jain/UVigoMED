{"id":82344,"title":"Determination of lysosomal exoglycosidases in human saliva.","abstract":"Currently we observe a growing interest in human saliva as a non-invasive material for diagnosis and monitoring of general and oral diseases.The aim of our study was adaptation of the Marciniak et al. (Marciniak J, Zalewska A, Popko J, Zwierz K, 2006, Clin Chem Lab Med 44: 933-937) method for determination of HEX and GLU activity in synovial fluid, and for determination of: HEX and GLU, as well as MAN, GAL, and FUC activity in human saliva.Under optimal conditions, 10 ?l of saliva for HEX, and 30 ?l for GLU, MAN, GAL and FUC, were sufficient for determination of human salivary exoglycosidases activity with variation coefficient ranging from 0.89 for GLU to 0.99 for GAL.The adapted method for exoglycosidases activity determination in human saliva is sufficiently sensitive and precise to use in clinical diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24644545","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.578454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.569858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Synovial fluid","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.447452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.342701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"MAN SE","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAN_SE"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Hexadecimal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"United Front for Democratic Change","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_for_Democratic_Change"},{"name":"OpenGL Utility Library","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Utility_Library"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"}]}
