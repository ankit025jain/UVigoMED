{"id":38152,"title":"Risk-adjusted prolonged length of stay as an alternative outcome measure for pediatric congenital cardiac surgery.","abstract":"Morbid events after pediatric congenital cardiac surgery are increasingly used for better outcome measurement and quality comparisons. This study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between a hospital's risk-adjusted prevalence of prolonged postoperative length of stay (PLOS) and its risk-adjusted mortality rate to investigate whether PLOS can serve as an appropriate quality measure for pediatric congenital cardiac surgery.Risk-adjusted prevalence of prolonged PLOS for 12 programs in New York State was estimated using data from 4,776 operations in the New York State pediatric Cardiac Surgery Reporting System (2006-2009). We used logistic regression analysis to adjust for case mix and patient risk factors. The hospital-level correlation between risk-adjusted prolonged PLOS and risk-adjusted mortality rates was examined using Spearman correlation coefficient analysis.Risk-adjusted prevalence of prolonged PLOS ranged from 7.48% to 36.52% for pediatric cardiac programs in New York State during the study period. The Spearman correlation test showed a strong positive relationship between a hospital's risk-adjusted prolonged PLOS and mortality rate (r = 0.83; p = 0.0008).Prolonged PLOS can be used in lieu of risk-adjusted mortality rates when it is not practical to use mortality rates owing to low case volume or decreasing mortality rates of some procedures.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444872","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.3965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.389086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.215594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.192333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.134633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Report","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report"}]}
