{"id":81898,"title":"Are predoctoral students able to provide single tooth implant restorations in the maxillary esthetic zone?","abstract":"The objective of this study was to assess the ability of the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry (UIC-COD) predoctoral students to provide single tooth implant (STI) prostheses in the maxillary esthetic zone. The patient's esthetic satisfaction and the correlation between prosthodontists' and patients' perspectives were examined. Twenty-seven patients were recruited for recall examinations at the UIC-COD predoctoral implant program and underwent clinical and radiographic examination with clinical photographs of the implant sites. The patients completed a semantic differential scale questionnaire. The collected information was formulated into a PowerPoint presentation for two Diplomate of the American Board of Prosthodontists to use the Pink/White Esthetic Score (PES/WES) to evaluate the esthetic outcome. Descriptive analyses, Cohen kappa test, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient test were performed. The average PES/WES were above 6.0 (out of 10). The median for the patient satisfaction and esthetic outcome questionnaires were 10 and 9, respectively, on a scale with 10=highest. There was a medium and positive correlation between prosthodontists' and patients' perspectives in esthetic outcome. This study found that, with strict guidance and proper selection criteria, predoctoral students were able to provide esthetically acceptable STI prostheses in the maxillary esthetic zone and patients were satisfied with the treatment provided.
