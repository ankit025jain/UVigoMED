{"id":17850,"title":"A molecular survey of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli virulence and diversity.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of virulence-associated genes and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) analysis of Campylobacter spp. isolated from children with diarrhea in Iran.A total of 200 stool specimens were obtained from children under 5 years during July 2012 to July 2013. Detection of C. jejuni and C. coli was performed by standard biochemical and molecular methods. The presence of virulence-associated genes and genetic diversity of isolates was examined using PCR and ERIC-PCR analyses.A total of 12 (6%) Campylobacter spp. were isolated from patients including 10 (4.5%) C. jejuni and 2 (1.5%) C.coli. The flaA, cadF and ciaB genes were present in 100% of isolates, while no plasmid of virB11 gene was present in their genome. The prevalence of invasion-associated marker was 100% among C. coli and was not detected in C. jejuni isolates. The distribution of both pldA and the genes associated with cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) was 58.3% in C. jejuni isolates. Seven distinct ERIC-PCR profiles were distinguished in three clusters using ERIC-PCR analysis. Genotyping analysis showed a relative correlation with geographic location of patients and virulence gene content of isolates.To our knowledge, this is the first molecular survey of Campylobacter spp. in Iran concerning genotyping and virulence gene content of both C. jejuni and C. coli. ERIC-PCR revealed appropriate discriminatory power for clustering C. jejuni isolates with identical virulence gene content. However, more studies are needed to clearly understand the pathogenesis properties of specific genotypes.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842142","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.842918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.79374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.793125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.789504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.645819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.532539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.352809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.348919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.319321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Campylobacter","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.11264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Inflorescence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"},{"name":"Intergenic region","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergenic_region"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
