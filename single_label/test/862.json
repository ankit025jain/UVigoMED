{"id":862,"title":"Osteomyelitis at two noncontiguous sites caused by Mycobacterium marinum in an immunocompetent host: case report and literature review.","abstract":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria are rare causes of skin, soft tissue, and musculoskeletal infections. Mycobacterium marinum remains one of the most commonly encountered mycobacterial species in humans, causing superficial cutaneous as well as deep infections. We are reporting a case of M. marinum osteomyelitis involving two primary noncontiguous sites in an immunocompetent host, which was successfully treated with surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306800","annotations":[{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.706838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.603867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.403037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontuberculous_mycobacteria"},{"name":"Mycobacterium marinum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_marinum"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Drain (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_(surgery)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
