{"id":87242,"title":"[Structural changes and cellular composition of the mesenterial lymph nodes in mice of first generation after parental exposure to radiation].","abstract":"Changes of the structure and cellular composition of mesenterial lymph nodes were studied in 93 outbred albino mice born from parents exposed to 0.3 and 3.0 Gy of the ionizing radiation, after single intraperitoneal immunization of the offspring with sheep erythrocytes. The changes (lymphoid tissue hypoplasia with the reduction of lymphocyte and plasma cell numbers, increase of apoptotic cell, macrophage and reticular cell numbers, as well as cell detritis volume) were more pronounced after an exposure to high-dose radiation. The outgrowth of node stroma, circulatory disturbances and tissue edema were observed. The processes of lymphoid tissue reduction in the cortex affected the medullary structure, finally resulting in the early lymph node involution, that reflected the changes in the general adaptation and defense reactions of the whole immune system.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552084","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.859922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Reticular cell","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.72387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Lymphoid tissue","weight":0.620369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.601239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.590478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.572992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.357338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.3089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Medullary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Outcrossing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcrossing"}]}
