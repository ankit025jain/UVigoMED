{"id":43943,"title":"Long-term efficacy of infliximab for refractory ulcerative colitis: results from a single center experience.","abstract":"The long-term efficacy of infliximab (IFX) for patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of IFX treatment in patients with refractory UC.Thirty-three patients with refractory UC who received IFX treatment at Kyoto University Hospital between 2003 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. IFX intensification was defined as a dose escalation (up to 10 mg/kg) and/or shorter intervals between infusions (every 4-6 weeks).Of the 33 patients who received scheduled infusions of IFX, 24 (72.7%) achieved clinical remission within 8 weeks after initiating IFX treatment. Of these 24 responders, 17 (70.8%) experienced a relapse of UC and required IFX intensification, and 16 (66.7%) eventually maintained clinical remission with IFX treatment, including IFX intensification. Of the 33 patients, 6 (18.2%) underwent colectomy during IFX treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration <5 mg/L two weeks after starting IFX was a predictor of a positive clinical response to IFX induction therapy. No severe adverse events occurred in UC patients treated with IFX.IFX intensification was necessary for long-term maintenance of remission and to prevent colectomy in patients with refractory UC.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758588","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.79307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Infliximab","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.719848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.412277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.232807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.216904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.159721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.154458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Kyoto","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto"},{"name":"Kyoto University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_University"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"General linear model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model"},{"name":"Interactive Financial Exchange","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Financial_Exchange"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Escalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
