{"id":82236,"title":"Long-term stability of implant-anchored orthodontics in an adult patient with a Class II Division 2 malocclusion and a unilateral molar scissors-bite.","abstract":"This article reports the successful treatment using miniscrew anchorage of an adult patient with a severe deep overbite and a unilateral scissors-bite. A 23-year-old woman had chief complaints of maxillary incisal crowding and difficulty chewing. She was diagnosed with a severe Class II Division 2 malocclusion with anterior crowding and a unilateral scissors-bite caused by buccal elongation of the maxillary left second molar. The maxillary first premolars were extracted, and 3 miniscrews were implanted as skeletal anchorage to resolve the functional and esthetic problems. The total active treatment period was 41 months. As a result of the implant-anchored orthodontic treatment, both the patient's facial profile and occlusion significantly improved. The asymmetric movements of the incisor paths and bilateral condyles during lateral excursions disappeared. The satisfactory facial profile and resultant occlusion were maintained throughout a 49-month retention period. The patient was satisfied with the treatment results.
