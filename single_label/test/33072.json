{"id":33072,"title":"Chromosome microarrays in diagnostic testing: interpreting the genomic data.","abstract":"DNA-based Chromosome MicroArrays (CMAs) are now well established as diagnostic tools in clinical genetics laboratories. Over the last decade, the primary application of CMAs has been the genome-wide detection of a particular class of mutation known as copy number variants (CNVs). Since 2010, CMA testing has been recommended as a first-tier test for detection of CNVs associated with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and/or multiple congenital anomaliesâ€¦in the post-natal setting. CNVs are now regarded as pathogenic in 14-18 % of patients referred for these (and related) disorders.Through consideration of clinical examples, and several microarray platforms, we attempt to provide an appreciation of microarray diagnostics, from the initial inspection of the microarray data, to the composing of the patient report. In CMA data interpretation, a major challenge comes from the high frequency of clinically irrelevant CNVs observed within \"patient\" and \"normal\" populations. As might be predicted, the more common and clinically insignificant CNVs tend to be the smaller ones <100 kb in length, involving few or no known genes. However, this relationship is not at all straightforward: CNV length and gene content are only very imperfect indicators of CNV pathogenicity. Presently, there are no reliable means of separating, a priori, the benign from the pathological CNV classes.This chapter also considers sources of technical \"noise\" within CMA data sets. Some level of noise is inevitable in diagnostic genomics, given the very large number of data points generated in any one test. Noise further limits CMA resolution, and some miscalling of CNVs is unavoidable. In this, there is no ideal solution, but various strategies for handling noise are available. Even without solutions, consideration of these diagnostic problems per se is informative, as they afford critical insights into the biological and technical underpinnings of CNV discovery. These are indispensable to any clinician or scientist practising within the field of genome diagnostics.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
