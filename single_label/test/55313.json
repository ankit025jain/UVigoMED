{"id":55313,"title":"[Virtual guide on ocular self-examination to support the self-care practice for people with HIV/AIDS].","abstract":"The objective was to describe the process of development of a virtual guide on ocular self-examination for people with HIV/aids. The methodological proposal followed the five steps recommended by Falkembach: analysis and planning, modeling, implementation, evaluation and distribution. The adequacy of the printed version to the virtual required the construction of a tutorial video, adding illustrative photos for viewing possible ocular changes and interactive tool demonstrating the examination result to the user. In the first material assessment, we diagnosed failures in the layout, thus commands were replaced, unified, rearranged in an easy viewing and adequacy of language. It is possible to promote the approximation of users with prevention methods in the ocular health area through a virtual guide, contributing to develop skills and disseminate self-examination.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918888","annotations":[{"name":"Language","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.313988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.203767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Interactivity","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity"},{"name":"Approximation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Command (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)"},{"name":"Virtual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Tutorial","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorial"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Page layout","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"}]}
