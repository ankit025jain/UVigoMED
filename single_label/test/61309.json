{"id":61309,"title":"Proteasome inhibitors evoke latent tumor suppression programs in pro-B MLL leukemias through MLL-AF4.","abstract":"Chromosomal translocations disrupting MLL generate MLL-fusion proteins that induce aggressive leukemias. Unexpectedly, MLL-fusion proteins are rarely observed at high levels, suggesting excessive MLL-fusions may be incompatible with a malignant phenotype. Here, we used clinical proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and carfilzomib, to reduce the turnover of endogenous MLL-fusions and discovered that accumulated MLL-fusions induce latent, context-dependent tumor suppression programs. Specifically, in MLL pro-B lymphoid, but not myeloid, leukemias, proteasome inhibition triggers apoptosis and cell cycle arrest involving activation cleavage of BID by caspase-8 and upregulation of p27, respectively. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition conferred preliminary benefit to patients with MLL-AF4 leukemia. Hence, feasible strategies to treat cancer-type and oncogene-specific cancers can be improvised through harnessing inherent tumor suppression properties of individual oncogenic fusions.
