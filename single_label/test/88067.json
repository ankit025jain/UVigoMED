{"id":88067,"title":"Experience of using cultured epithelial autografts for the extensive burn wounds in eight patients.","abstract":"In Japan, the cultured epithelial autografts \"JACE\" was accepted as a health insurance adaptation from January 1, 2009. We examined the extensive burn wounds in 8 patients by using a combination of autograft and JACE. After debridement, we managed the wound bed preparation by using artificial dermis. The wound bed was covered with fine tissue 2 weeks after we implanted artificial dermis and trafermin was used every day. Meshed 6:1 split-thickness autografts were placed onto the recipient wound bed under the JACE. The epidermalization was nearly complete within 3 to 4 weeks.A total of 39 patients underwent medical treatment of burns. All patients burned more than 30% total body surface area (TBSA). We divided them into 2 groups. The control group consisted of 31 patient, 23 men and 8 women. They underwent operation not using JACE but only autograft. The average age of the patients was 59.61 (3.85) years. The TBSA burned in this control group was 58.94% (3.89%). Operation times were 2.16 (0.24) hours. The overall survival rate was 35.5%. The study group consisted of 8 patients, 5 men and 3 women. The average age of the patients was 56.38 (7.04) years. The TBSA burned in this study group was 51.63% (4.17%). Operation times were 4.25 (0.59) hours, and the overall survival rate in this study group was 87.5%. The average take rate of JACE was 80.0% (3.09%) 4 weeks postoperatively.JACE is one of the cultured epithelial autografts. Although we managed the wound bed preparation by using artificial dermis instead of cryopreserved cadaver allograft, we were able to recognize a good result from grafting JACE on meshed 6:1 split-thickness autografts. The study group observed a significant difference in operation times compared with the control group. However, this treatment contributed to reducing the area of the donor site.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918735","annotations":[{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.82565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.80978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.774928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.730687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.726513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.633361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.283254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0361946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0224377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
