{"id":53443,"title":"Differential genes in adipocytes induced from polycystic and non-polycystic ovary syndrome-derived human embryonic stem cells.","abstract":"We explored the molecular mechanisms of obesity and insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using a human embryonic stem cell model (hESCs). Three PCOS-derived and one non-PCOS-derived hESC lines were induced into adipocytes, and then total RNA was extracted. The differentially expressed PCOS-derived and non-PCOS-derived adipocytes genes were identified using the Boao Biological human V 2.0 whole genome oligonucleotide microarray. Signals of interest were then validated by real-time PCR. A total of 153 differential genes were expressed of which 91 genes were up-regulated and 62 down-regulated. Nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2) was an up-regulated gene, and the GeneChip CapitalBioÂ® Molecule Annotation System V4.0 indicated that it was associated with obesity and diabetes (Ratio ? 2.0X). Multiple genes are involved in PCOS. Nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 may play a role in obesity and insulin resistance in patients with PCOS.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Endocrine System
