{"id":91794,"title":"Cutaneous changes in rats induced by chronic skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation and organophosphate pesticide.","abstract":"To study the possible potentiation of the carcinogenic effects of ultraviolet radiation associated with an organophosphate pesticide.Forty Wistar rats were assigned into four groups (n=10 each) randomized according to the procedures: group A received only UVR-B radiation; group B, UVR-B for eight weeks followed by a seven week period of pesticide exposure; group C, UVR-B + pesticide concomitantly: group D, only pesticide application. At the end of the fifth, tenth and fifteenth weeks the animals were photographed. Skin biopsy and histopathological study with Hematoxylin-Eosin were done on the fifteenth week. Statistical analysis with Fisher's and Sign (unilateral) tests, 5% value for significance.Macroscopic lesions in the group A evolved from the erythema to erythema + desquamation. The groups B and C, with the association of two carcinogens, and group D presented evolution to keratosis, with higher incidence in group D. The histology showed a significant increase in the severity of injuries when the UVR-B and the pesticide were applied simultaneously, leading to cellular atypia.Concurrent association of UVR-B to organophosphate pesticide produced more severe lesions microscopically, although this has not been so apparent macroscopically. In daily practice the clinical evaluation should be complemented with laboratory evaluation.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474172","annotations":[{"name":"Pesticide","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.473483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.316699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Organophosphate","weight":0.175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organophosphate"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.13286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Desquamation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desquamation"},{"name":"Pesticide application","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_application"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Keratosis","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratosis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"}]}
