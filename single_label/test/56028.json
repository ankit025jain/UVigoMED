{"id":56028,"title":"Management of IRVAN syndrome with observation.","abstract":"A 7-year-old girl with IRVAN (idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis) syndrome was monitored for 9 years. The patient had symmetric multiple aneurysmal dilations, retinal vasculitis, and severe hard exudation in the macula bilaterally. Long-term visual acuity in her untreated right eye was 20/25. In the left eye, treated with laser panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor therapy, visual acuity decreased to 20/200 from macular hard exudates and central fibrovascular tissue. Observation is a consideration in IRVAN syndrome if the vision remains good with hard exudation.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766157","annotations":[{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.773426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.624116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.385244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.343613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.292516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.114233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Vascular tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_tissue"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
