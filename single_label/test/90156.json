{"id":90156,"title":"Bipolar dislocation of the forearm (floating forearm).","abstract":"Bipolar dislocation of the forearm (floating forearm) is an unusual injury and is therefore often overlooked. We report a 28-year-old male patient who presented at another center with a history of a fall while climbing a tree. The patient's left elbow was treated with closed reduction and immobilization with a long-arm cast brace due to elbow dislocation. However, the patient was admitted with pain and swelling of the wrist to our emergency department the following day. Physical and radiological examination revealed dorsal trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocation. A dorsal incision was performed for open reduction and internal fixation to provide wide surgical exposure. Concomitant occurrence of elbow dislocation and fracture-dislocation of the perilunate is infrequent. Therefore, physicians should be aware of possible additional injuries and current recommended treatment methods.
