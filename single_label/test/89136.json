{"id":89136,"title":"The effect of hydroxyapatite coated screw in the lateral fragility fractures of the femur. A prospective randomized clinical study.","abstract":"Due to a growing numbers of lateral fragility fractures of the femur and their high social costs the need to work out an effective strategy in order to find a better solution for these patients is warranted. From January 2010 to July 2011, we carried out a prospective randomized clinical study comparing the results of patients with femoral lateral fractures treated by nail and cephalic hydroxyapatite coated screws (study group including 27 patients) compared to the patients with the same fractures treated with nail and head standard screws (control group including 27 patients). We defined the two parts of the femoral neck as ROI 1 (under the head screw) and ROI 2 (above the femoral screw) on the AP view. The bone density of the two areas was calculated using DEXA at T0 (1st day post-surgery), at T1 (40th day post-surgery), at T2 (3 months later), at T3 (1 year later). The clinical-radiography evaluations were based on the Harris Hip Score (HHS), ADL test and x-ray views of the hip. As far as the bone mineral density average of ROI 1 and ROI 2 is concerned, we found a significant statistical increase at T1 and T3 in the study group, while it was not significant in the control group. We could account for this data through the higher mechanical stability of hydroxyapatite coated screws than standard screws. In fact, this material was responsible for improved implant osteointegration. Thanks to a 1 year follow-up we were able to demonstrate the implant utility associated with augmentation and the importance of densitometry exams such as easily repeatable and low cost diagnostics to prevent the onset of complications linked to screw loosening.
