{"id":88712,"title":"Minimally invasive in the treatment of clavicle middle part fractures with locking reconstruction plate.","abstract":"We aimed to assess the possibility and feasibilities in the treatment of clavicle midpiece fracture by minimally invasive with percutaneous locking reconstitution plate.Total 29 cases of patients with clavicle midpiece fractures were reviewed including 13 males and 16 females. All the patients were treated by minimally invasive with locking reconstitution plates.All the patients showed satisfaction of the appearance of incision and union of all the fractures. One case suffered fixation device failure and 3 cases suffered skin irritation responses.The minimally invasive with locking reconstruction plate is a good option for clavicle midpiece fractures treatment with good fracture healing.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802518","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.271025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.119397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Lithography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"}]}
