{"id":16491,"title":"Infection after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","abstract":"Septic arthritis is a rare but potentially devastating complication of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The purpose of this study was to provide an evidence-based summarization of the treatment and outcome of infection after ACL reconstruction with a pooled analysis of the reported cases. The authors conducted a systematic review of published studies that evaluated the outcome of septic arthritis after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. A structured literature review of multiple databases referenced articles from 1950 to 2012. A total of 22,836 knees from 14 published studies were assessed. Postoperative septic arthritis occurred in 121 knees, with a pooled percentage of 0.5%. Mean duration of follow-up after ACL reconstruction was 53.6 months (range, 4-218 months). An average of 1.92 procedures (range, 1-5 procedures) were performed to eradicate the infection. The grafts were retained in 77% of cases. Postoperative intravenous antibiotics were used for at least 5 days (range, 5-90 days) after debridement. At final follow-up, mean postoperative Lysholm score was 80.2 (range, 23-100). No reinfection was observed in 121 patients. This study has helped to further elucidate the outcomes of infection after ACL reconstruction. Once an infection is encountered, culture-specific antibiotics and surgical joint irrigation with graft retention are recommended as initial treatment. Graft removal can be considered only for those infections resistant to initial treatment.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992054","annotations":[{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.741285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.699044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.621983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.551787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.506934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.501451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.374879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.263355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.231451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.0628516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"590","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/590"},{"name":"836","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/836"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Automatic summarization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
