{"id":33824,"title":"Carney complex: fourth time excision of recurrent atrial myxoma via left thoracotomy.","abstract":"We report a case of a 51-year-old male patient with a known history of Carney complex, who was operated on for the fourth time due to recurrent left atrial myxomas. Despite surgical challenge, the operation was uneventful. The patient had a difficult postoperative period and needed further treatment for complications. After a prolonged recovery, he is currently well and remains myxoma-free up until now (36 months postsurgery) with regular follow-up using cardiac CT and transthoracic echocardiogram.
