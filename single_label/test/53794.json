{"id":53794,"title":"A review of advances in collaborative pharmacy practice to improve adherence to standards of care in diabetes management.","abstract":"The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is increasing and so is the need to provide diabetes care. Given the time commitment and complexity of diabetes management, an interdisciplinary approach is recommended. Pharmacists are integral members of the diabetes care team because of their accessibility and expertise in medication management. Pharmacists are receiving specialized training and becoming more involved in direct patient care through collaborative practice opportunities such as medication therapy management and collaborative drug therapy management. These collaborative practice models increase patient access to care and allow pharmacists to optimize drug therapy and provide important education to promote diabetes self-management. Studies show pharmacists practicing in a variety of outpatient environments can reduce HbA1c, LDL and BP as well as improve adherence to recommended American Diabetes Association guidelines (yearly monofilament exams, dilated eye exams, microalbumin screening, etc). Pharmacists working as part of the health care team can ensure optimal diabetes management.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496918","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.578211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.296569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.202155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmacy practice","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy_practice"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.147257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"American Diabetes Association","weight":0.143079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Diabetes_Association"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Medication therapy management","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication_therapy_management"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Eye examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_examination"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"}]}
