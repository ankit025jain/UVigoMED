{"id":69446,"title":"Less satisfaction with information in patients with prostate cancer treated with surgery and salvage radiotherapy compared with patients treated with curative radiotherapy alone, despite similar health-related quality of life.","abstract":"This study examined patient perception of information received, satisfaction with that information, and its relation to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and clinical and demographic variables before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT) for localized prostate cancer.In 2010, 2 questionnaires (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 [EORTC QLQ-C30] and EORTC QLQ information module [QLQ-INFO25]) were sent to 660 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who had undergone or were to undergo RT with curative intent between December 2006 and MarchÂ 2010.The response rate was 92%. Although most patients (69%) were satisfied with the information they received, statistically significant differences were found for all but 2 EORTC QLQ-INFO25 variables, favoring those who were treated with RT alone compared with those treated with both prostatectomy and salvage RT. Statistically significant associations between all HRQoL variables and satisfaction with information were found; higher levels of satisfaction were associated with better functioning and lower levels of symptoms and problems.Satisfaction with the information received was studied in patients with prostate cancer with localized disease. Despite the fact that the majority of patients reported being satisfied with the information received, there is room for improvement, especially regarding \"the disease,\" \"other services,\" \"different places of care,\" and \"things you can do to help yourself.\" Patients treated with both prostatectomy and salvage RT reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction with information received and of having received significantly less information than did patients treated with RT alone.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445250","annotations":[{"name":"EORTC","weight":0.827236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EORTC"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.707321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.224121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Module (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Localized disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localized_disease"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
