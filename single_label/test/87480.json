{"id":87480,"title":"Radiographic pitfalls in lower extremity trauma.","abstract":"Radiography remains the imaging standard for fracture detection after trauma. However, fractures continue to be the most common type of missed injuries. In this article, we describe common radiographic pitfalls in lower extremity trauma and describe strategies for dealing with them.Pitfalls include insufficient views, improperly positioned or technically imperfect radiographs, nondisplaced fractures, commonly missed locations, small avulsions portending large injury, sesamoid injuries, satisfaction of search, incomplete or faulty reasoning, and periprosthetic fractures.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148151","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.590766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.535138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.46748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0863636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Typeface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface"},{"name":"Imperfect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperfect"},{"name":"Avulsion (river)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_(river)"},{"name":"Sesamoid bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamoid_bone"}]}
