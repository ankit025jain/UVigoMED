{"id":52163,"title":"Good vs. poor self-rated diabetes control: differences in cardiovascular risk and self-care activities.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess differences in cardiovascular risk and performance of self-care activities in people who rated their diabetes control as good or poor.A sub-sample of 77 participants who took part in the Evaluation of Diabetes Treatment telephone interview were invited into a clinic to complete a series of laboratory examinations. Self-rated diabetes control was validated using the following laboratory markers: HbA1c, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio and LDL cholesterol. Differences in blood pressure and BMI were also assessed. Finally, all participants also completed the Summary of Self-Care activities questionnaire.Those people who rated their diabetes control as fair or poor had a significantly higher BMI, HbA1c levels, total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio and systolic blood pressure. When asked about self-care activities in the past week, those people who reported their diabetes control was fair/poor had spent significantly fewer days following a general diet and exercising.People with poor self-rated diabetes control have unfavourable cardiovascular risk and decreased performance of self-care activities.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623501","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.804766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.562603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.292129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.160494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.0988882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
