{"id":90911,"title":"Severe pelvic bone loss treated using a coned acetabular prosthesis with a stem extension inside the ilium.","abstract":"We describe a modified surgical technique for the reconstruction of major acetabular defects using a coned acetabular component (the Stanmore 'ice-cream' cone prosthesis) and report its early clinical outcomes. A single surgeon performed 28 acetabular reconstructions using a stemmed-cone acetabular prosthesis (mean age 70.9 years; 61% female) in 15 oncology patients with periacetabular metastases and 13 patients requiring complex arthroplasty procedures. Defects were graded using the Paprosky classification (10 = 3A; 8 = 3B; 10 = pelvic discontinuity). All procedures were performed without fluoroscopy using an extended posterior hip approach. Mean operative time (including anaesthesia) was 133 minutes; there were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications had occurred in 14% (n = 4), at a mean follow-up of 12.5 months (range: 2-33 months). There were no failures in patients with pelvic discontinuity. The stemmed-cone acetabular prosthesis was found to provide a useful method for acetabular reconstruction (including pelvic discontinuity) in both complex oncological and hip arthroplasty cases.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563974","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.777817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.705314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.655606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.647422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.635324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.328847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.284364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stanmore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanmore"},{"name":"Schur multiplier","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_multiplier"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 8","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_8"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ice cream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Third baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"233 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/233_(number)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"}]}
