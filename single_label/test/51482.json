{"id":51482,"title":"Trends in the prevalence of ketoacidosis at diabetes diagnosis: the SEARCH for diabetes in youth study.","abstract":"To estimate temporal changes in the prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in youth and to explore factors associated with its occurrence.Five centers identified incident cases of diabetes among youth aged 0 to 19 years starting in 2002. DKA presence was defined as a bicarbonate level <15 mmol/L and/or a pH <7.25 (venous) or <7.30 (arterial or capillary) or mention of DKA in the medical records. We assessed trends in the prevalence of DKA over 3 time periods (2002-2003, 2004-2005, and 2008-2010). Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with DKA.In youth with type 1 diabetes (n = 5615), the prevalence of DKA was high and stable over time (30.2% in 2002-2003, 29.1% in 2004-2005, and 31.1% in 2008-2010; P for trend = .42). Higher prevalence was associated with younger age at diagnosis (P < .0001), minority race/ethnicity (P = .019), income (P = .019), and lack of private health insurance (P = 008). Among youth with type 2 diabetes (n = 1425), DKA prevalence decreased from 11.7% in 2002-2003 to 5.7% in 2008-2010 (P for trend = .005). Higher prevalence was associated with younger age at diagnosis (P = .001), minority race/ethnicity (P = .013), and male gender (P = .001).The frequency of DKA in youth with type 1 diabetes, although stable, remains high, indicating a persistent need for increased awareness of signs and symptoms of diabetes and better access to health care. In youth with type 2 diabetes, DKA at onset is less common and is decreasing over time.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685959","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetic ketoacidosis","weight":0.821379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.756556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.498419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.332764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.253154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.235915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bicarbonate","weight":0.172396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate"},{"name":"Ketoacidosis","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
