{"id":18051,"title":"[Factors affecting transmission of contagious diseases].","abstract":"Factors affecting transmission of contagious diseases There are differences in the transmission rate of infectious diseases. The mathematic estimates of the transmission rate of various contagious diseases are impossible to predict. The Basic reproduction number, the so-called Ro-value tends to extrapolate the number of persons who can get infected from one person. To prevent some contagious diseases, a high rate of herd immunity is required. This immunity is achieved by mass vaccination. Infections are transmitted by aerosol, drop, fecalo-oral, blood or contact routes. Nosocomial infections are transmitted usually by contact or fecalo-oral routes whereas the majority of healthcare related infections are transmitted by contact with infected blood or through aerosol transmission.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822329","annotations":[{"name":"Herd immunity","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.763952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.514462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Contagious disease","weight":0.405091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_disease"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.2769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Mass (liturgy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)"},{"name":"Extrapolation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
