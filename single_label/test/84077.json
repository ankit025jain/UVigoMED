{"id":84077,"title":"Suspected iatrogenic ureteric injury: an approach to diagnostic imaging.","abstract":"Iatrogenic ureteric injury (IUI) is the leading cause of ureteric trauma and a complication of major abdominal and pelvic surgery. IUI carries significant morbidity and mortality, which can be further compounded by delayed diagnosis due to its non-specific clinical presentation. We review ureteric anatomy, types of IUI, and imaging strategies available for diagnosis. We propose an imaging protocol for prompt diagnosis and follow-up.
