{"id":66772,"title":"Robotic laparoscopic pyeloplasty.","abstract":"We aimed to assess the feasibility and outcomes of complex ureteropelvic junction obstruction cases submitted to robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty.The records of 131 consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty were reviewed. Of this initial population of cases, 17 were considered complex, consisting of either atypical anatomy (horseshoe kidneys in 3 patients) or previous ureteropelvic junction obstruction management (14 patients). The patients were divided into 2 groups: primary pyeloplasty (group 1) and complex cases (group 2).The mean operative time was 117.3 ± 33.5 minutes in group 1 and 153.5 ± 31.1 minutes in group 2 (P = .002). The median hospital stay was 5.19 ± 1.66 days in group 1 and 5.90 ± 2.33 days in group 2 (P = .326). The surgical findings included 53 crossing vessels in group 1 and 5 in group 2. One patient in group 1 required conversion to open surgery because of technical difficulties. One patient in group 2, with a history of hemorrhagic rectocolitis, presented with peritonitis postoperatively due to a small colonic injury. A secondary procedure was performed after the patient had an uneventful recovery. At 3 months, significant improvement (clinical and radiologic) was present in 93% of cases in group 1 and 88.2% in group 2. At 1 year, all patients in group 2 showed satisfactory results. At a late follow-up visit, 1 patient in group 1 presented with a recurrent obstruction.Robotic pyeloplasty appear to be feasible and effective, showing a consistent success rate even in complex situations. Particular care should be observed during the colon dissection in patients with previous colonic pathology.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680152","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.751207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.716811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.507659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.283325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Horseshoe kidney","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_kidney"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Particular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Crossing (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_(architecture)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"},{"name":"Horseshoe","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe"},{"name":"Pyeloplasty","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeloplasty"}]}
