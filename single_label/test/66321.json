{"id":66321,"title":"The role of lymphadenectomy in the management of renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"The role of lymphadenectomy in the management of renal cell carcinoma has been established in staging but is less well defined as a therapeutic maneuver. Level one evidence suggests no survival benefit or increased complication rate with lymphadenectomy when performed concurrently with radical nephrectomy. However, several retrospective studies have identified a survival benefit when patients with increased risk of micrometastatic lymph node disease undergo lymphadenectomy. We perform a selective review of the literature and present the historical basis, risk assessment, use and development of nodal templates, and therapeutic benefits associated with the use of lymphadenectomy in the management of renal cell carcinoma.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723269","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.808004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.161111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.142977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fact","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
