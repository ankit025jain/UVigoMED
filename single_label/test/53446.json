{"id":53446,"title":"TNF? dynamics during the oral glucose tolerance test vary according to the level of insulin resistance in pregnant women.","abstract":"TNF? is suspected to play a role in inflammation and insulin resistance leading to higher risk of metabolic impairment. Controversies exist concerning the role of TNF? in gestational insulin resistance. We investigated the interrelations between TNF? and insulin resistance in a large population-based cohort of pregnant women.Women (n = 756) were followed prospectively at 5-16 weeks and 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. Anthropometric measures and blood samples were collected at both visits. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted at the second trimester to assess insulin sensitivity status (homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance and Matsuda index). TNF? was measured at the first trimester (nonfasting) and at each time point of the OGTT.Participants were 28.4 ± 4.4 years old and had a mean body mass index of 25.5 ± 5.5 kg/m(2) at first trimester. Median TNF? levels were 1.56 (interquartile range, 1.18-2.06) pg/mL at first trimester and 1.61 (interquartile range, 1.12-2.13) pg/mL at second trimester (1 h after glucose load). At second trimester, higher TNF? levels were associated with higher insulin resistance index levels (r = 0.37 and -0.30 for homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance and Matsuda index, respectively; P < .0001), even after adjustment for age, body mass index, triglycerides, and adiponectin. Women with higher insulin resistance showed a continuing decrease in TNF? levels during the OGTT, whereas women who were more insulin sensitive showed an increase in TNF? at hour 1 and a decrease at hour 2 of the test.Higher insulin resistance is associated with higher levels of circulating TNF? at first and second trimesters of pregnancy. TNF? level dynamics during an OGTT at second trimester vary according to insulin-resistance state.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517151","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.565672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.491175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.453049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.423759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.415743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0783418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
