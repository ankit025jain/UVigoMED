{"id":84079,"title":"[Characteristics of the pharmacological pathomorphosis of remission in schizoaffective disorders].","abstract":"To study the effects of different types of psychopharmacotherapy on the changes in the duration and clinical symptoms of remissions in patients with schizoaffective disorders (SAD).Authors have analyzed the therapeutic pathomorphosis of remissions in patients with SAD examined from 1980 to 2013. One hundred and there patients have been stratified into 3 groups: patients treated from 1980 to 1990 (group 1), from 1991 to 1999 (group 2) and from 2000 to 2013 (group 3).Main changes in the quality of remission were correlated with the reduction in the patients' commitment to anti-relapse therapy due to the reduction in the control over its timely receipt as well as decreasing of active surveillance of the mental health of patients. Social factors, together with biological factors (pharmacotherapy), are no less important to maintain the quality of remission providing not only the improvement of compliance in patients, but also increasing their social adaptation.Supporting therapy can be recommended for administration within a year after the first onset of SAD and within three years after repeated attacks. Long-term anti-relapse treatment is recommended to patients with residual symptoms or low compliance.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176262","annotations":[{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.696914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.301072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.294121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Schizoaffective disorder","weight":0.16279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.144723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"}]}
