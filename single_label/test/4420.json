{"id":4420,"title":"[The investigation of malaria cases in Manisa between 2008-2012].","abstract":"We aimed to determine the malaria prevalence in a 5-year period by using the data obtained from Malaria Control Center associated with the Manisa Province Public Health Office Infectious Diseases Department in Manisa between 2008 and 2012.The data were evaluated according to age, gender, type of parasite, and the places of travel.In this study, six imported malaria cases were detected in blood samples from 86,955 patients by the Malaria Control Center, associated with the Manisa Province Public Health Office Infectious Diseases Department, with active and passive surveillance between 2008 and 2012. Positivity rate was 0.007%.Imported malaria cases, due to increasing international travel and migration, have a serious endemic potential based on unsuitable or insufficient prophylaxis, although malaria cases have decreased notably by successful eradication studies in Turkey. This paper was prepared especially in order to point out this subject, because all of the cases were imported.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308450","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.790201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.729552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.65303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.643122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.283484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.283248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Manisa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manisa"},{"name":"Manisa Province","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manisa_Province"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Active safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_safety"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Positivism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
