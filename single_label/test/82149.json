{"id":82149,"title":"Oral focal mucinosis associated with surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion.","abstract":"Oral focal mucinosis is a rare soft-tissue lesion that might result from the overproduction of hyaluronic acid by fibroblasts. The lesions are commonly found on the gingiva and palate; however, other sites, such as the tongue, have also been reported. The diagnosis of oral focal mucinosis is based on histologic analysis, and treatment involves surgical excision. Recurrences of lesions have not been reported. This article presents a patient with oral focal mucinosis that might be associated with surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion.
