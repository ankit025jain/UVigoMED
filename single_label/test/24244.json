{"id":24244,"title":"Outcome-related co-factors in 105 cases of vertebral osteomyelitis in a tertiary care hospital.","abstract":"Vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is an infection of the vertebral body and the adjacent disc space. The aim of our study was to identify outcome-related co-factors of patients with VO treated in the last decade.We retrospectively identified 105 patients with VO (mean age 66.1 years) who had been treated at our institution from 2004 to 2011. The median time of hospitalization at our institution was 31.5 days, and 44 patients required intensive medical care. Back pain and fever were documented in 66.7 and 33.3 % of cases, respectively. The radiologic diagnosis of VO was made in 94.8 % of all obtained magnetic resonance imaging scans and in 66.2 % of all computed tomography (CT) scans. Biopsies were taken in 71 patients, and the causative organisms were identified in 56.2 % of patients, with Staphylococcus aureus being the predominant pathogen. Fifty-six patients underwent surgical treatment. During hospitalization, infectious complications were observed in 63 patients (60.0 %). The most common complications were psoas, paravertebral and epidural abscesses. Patients with S. aureus infections had a significantly higher rate of infectious complications than those without (76.5 vs. 40.3 %, respectively), and were more frequently treated in intensive care units (58.8 vs. 34.7 %, respectively). Overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12.4 %. Elevated C-reactive protein levels at admission, advanced age and a Charlson Comorbidity Index of ?2 were associated with higher mortality.Magnetic resonance imaging currently is the imaging procedure of choice for the radiologic diagnosis of VO. Mortality is attributable in part to co-morbidities. However, infections with S. aureus are frequent in this patient population and are associated with a higher rate of complications and a trend towards higher mortality.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446233","annotations":[{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.7069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.578452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.567072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"1980s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"}]}
