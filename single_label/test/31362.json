{"id":31362,"title":"The effect of calcium and phosphorus supplementation on metabolic bone disorders in premature infants.","abstract":"To determine the impact of calcium and phosphorus on radiological and biochemical characteristics of osteopenia in premature infants.The randomised clinical trial study was conducted at Valie-e-Asr Hospital of Zanjan city, Iran, from December 2010 to June 2011. It involved monitoring 40 premature neonates over a period of six months. The babies, who were fed with breast milk and 400 units of vitamin D daily, were randomly divided into two equal groups. One group received supplement of calcium and phosphorus. Serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels as well as growth parameters (including weight, height, and head circumference) were measured every two weeks. At the end of the study, wrist X-ray was done for evaluation of osteopenia. Data was analysed using SPSS 16.Radiological changes, characteristic of osteopenia, were found in 8 (40%) cases and 13 (65%) controls (p < 0.113). The mean of weight, length and head circumference increased significantly from second to sixth week during follow-up (p < 0.0001). Phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase activity decreased significantly from second to sixth week of follow-up (p < 0.02, p < 0.01 respectively). However, repeated measurement analyses did not show significant effect of intervention in biochemical and growth parameters in the trial group.The study didn't show significant effect of calcium and phosphorus on prevention of osteopenia and improvement of growth. Further studies of longer duration and with different doses of supplement are recommended.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252480","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Phosphorus","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Human breast milk","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_breast_milk"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.780698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Osteopenia","weight":0.760555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopenia"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.665601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.629691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.594301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.54354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.381316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.191721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.154944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.0943895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
