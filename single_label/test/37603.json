{"id":37603,"title":"A prospective study of microscope-integrated intraoperative fluorescein videoangiography during arteriovenous malformation surgery: preliminary results.","abstract":"The authors report on the use of a recently developed microscope-integrated fluorescent module using low-dose intravenous fluorescein for videoangiography during arteriovenous malformation (AVM) surgery.The authors analyzed the application of a low-dose intraoperative fluorescein in 4 consecutive patients undergoing AVM surgery. The ability to distinguish the associated vessels of the AVM from normal vessels and to assess the degree of AVM obliteration based on videoangiography of venous drainage was specifically analyzed.All 4 patients underwent fluorescein angiography without complication. In each case, videoangiography confirmed recognition of feeding arteries and draining veins through the operating oculars under the fluorescent mode. In one case involving a large frontal AVM, videoangiography demonstrated mainly cortical veins on the surface of the AVM and alerted the senior author to first tackle the feeding arteries in the interhemispheric space. While evaluating the flow within the different draining veins after most of the AVM was disconnected, videoangiography also prioritized the order for disconnection of large draining veins to allow mobilization the AVM and exposure of the remaining deep arterial feeders. In the other 3 cases, videoangiography allowed easy recognition of the angioarchitecture of the AVMs, estimated its cortical boundaries, and most importantly, assessed the flow within the draining veins before their disconnection.The authors found fluorescein videoangiography to be a useful adjunct in resection of AVMs. This technology offers the unique ability to visualize fluorescent vessels and nonfluorescent tissues in near-natural colors simultaneously and permits microsurgical manipulation of relevant structures under the fluorescent mode. Larger-scale studies are needed to establish its efficacy and wider applicability.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484253","annotations":[{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.591075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.514089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.396074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.31082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.156741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.041581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Disconnection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disconnection"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Normal mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Module (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Psychological manipulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation"}]}
