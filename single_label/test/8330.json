{"id":8330,"title":"Efficacy of orally administered maropitant citrate in preventing vomiting associated with hydromorphone administration in dogs.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of orally administered maropitant citrate in preventing vomiting after hydromorphone hydrochloride administration in dogs.Randomized, blinded, prospective clinical study.40 dogs with American Society of Anesthesiologists status of I or II, > 6 months of age, and weighing between 24 and 58.2 kg (52.8 and 128.04 lb).Dogs were randomly selected to receive maropitant (2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg [0.9 to 1.8 mg/lb]) or placebo (lactose monohydrate) orally 2 hours prior to receiving hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg [0.045 mg/lb], IM). A blinded observer recorded the occurrence of vomiting or signs of nausea (eg, salivation or lip-licking) during a 30-minute period after hydromorphone administration. Two-tailed Fisher exact tests were used to compare the incidences of vomiting and signs of nausea with or without vomiting between treatment groups. Results-Of the 20 dogs receiving maropitant, none vomited but 12 (60%) developed signs of nausea. Of the 20 dogs receiving placebo, 5 (25%) vomited and 11 (55%) developed signs of nausea; overall, 16 of 20 (80%) dogs in the placebo treatment group vomited or developed signs of nausea. Compared with the effects of placebo, maropitant significantly decreased the incidence of vomiting but not signs of nausea in dogs administered hydromorphone.Among the 40 study dogs, the incidence of vomiting associated with hydromorphone administration was 25%. Oral administration of maropitant prevented vomiting but not signs of nausea associated with hydromorphone administration in dogs.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786163","annotations":[{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hydromorphone","weight":0.699598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydromorphone"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.699309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.650183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.629809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.604453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.565672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lactose","weight":0.514666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.459907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.350223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.310706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.25322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Citrate","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0692562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pound (mass)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Hydrate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate"}]}
