{"id":56612,"title":"Long-term longitudinal study of patients treated with ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To review the current literature regarding long-term treatment beyond 2 years with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nv-AMD).Only few studies of anti-VEGF treatment for nv-AMD exist beyond 2 years, and the number of patients followed for 4 years or longer is small. The results of studies show that the majority of patients with nv-AMD can preserve visual acuity compared with baseline, subgroups reveal large variations in visual benefit. Approximately 20-30% of patients seem to respond poorly to the treatment, and 20% obtain a condition with inactivity and good results. The majority of patients will need continuous active treatment. Long-term decline of visual acuity reflects the natural progression of the disease, however, insufficient treatment cannot be excluded leaving a potential for further improvement. Close follow-up to detect recurrent activity of nv-AMD and activity in fellow eye is important. Definitive evidence of systemic side-effects is lacking, but long-term VEGF inhibition seems to be tolerated well with few ocular and systemic complications.The majority of patients with nv-AMD can preserve visual acuity and expect long-term treatment beyond 2 years. Ocular complications and systemic adverse events remain few.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24663065","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.874809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.5407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.225534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.173267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.167182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
