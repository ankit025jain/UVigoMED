{"id":91332,"title":"Does a microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee affect stair ascent strategies in persons with transfemoral amputation?","abstract":"Stair ascent can be difficult for individuals with transfemoral amputation because of the loss of knee function. Most individuals with transfemoral amputation use either a step-to-step (nonreciprocal, advancing one stair at a time) or skip-step strategy (nonreciprocal, advancing two stairs at a time), rather than a step-over-step (reciprocal) strategy, because step-to-step and skip-step allow the leading intact limb to do the majority of work. A new microprocessor-controlled knee (Ottobock X2(®)) uses flexion/extension resistance to allow step-over-step stair ascent.We compared self-selected stair ascent strategies between conventional and X2(®) prosthetic knees, examined between-limb differences, and differentiated stair ascent mechanics between X2(®) users and individuals without amputation. We also determined which factors are associated with differences in knee position during initial contact and swing within X2(®) users.Fourteen individuals with transfemoral amputation participated in stair ascent sessions while using conventional and X2(®) knees. Ten individuals without amputation also completed a stair ascent session. Lower-extremity stair ascent joint angles, moment, and powers and ground reaction forces were calculated using inverse dynamics during self-selected strategy and cadence and controlled cadence using a step-over-step strategy.One individual with amputation self-selected a step-over-step strategy while using a conventional knee, while 10 individuals self-selected a step-over-step strategy while using X2(®) knees. Individuals with amputation used greater prosthetic knee flexion during initial contact (32.5°, p = 0.003) and swing (68.2°, p = 0.001) with higher intersubject variability while using X2(®) knees compared to conventional knees (initial contact: 1.6°, swing: 6.2°). The increased prosthetic knee flexion while using X2(®) knees normalized knee kinematics to individuals without amputation during swing (88.4°, p = 0.179) but not during initial contact (65.7°, p = 0.002). Prosthetic knee flexion during initial contact and swing were positively correlated with prosthetic limb hip power during pull-up (r = 0.641, p = 0.046) and push-up/early swing (r = 0.993, p < 0.001), respectively.Participants with transfemoral amputation were more likely to self-select a step-over-step strategy similar to individuals without amputation while using X2(®) knees than conventional prostheses. Additionally, the increased prosthetic knee flexion used with X2(®) knees placed large power demands on the hip during pull-up and push-up/early swing. A modified strategy that uses less knee flexion can be used to allow step-over-step ascent in individuals with less hip strength.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515402","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.835991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Inverse dynamics","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_dynamics"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.645747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.37889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Reaction (physics)","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_(physics)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Stairway","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"641","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/641"},{"name":"993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/993"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Swing music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"X2 (film)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X2_(film)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Cadence (music)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_(music)"}]}
