{"id":19978,"title":"Environmentally benign synthesis and antimicrobial study of novel chalcogenophosphates.","abstract":"We report in this work an environmentally benign zinc mediated synthesis of aryl and benzyl phosphorochalcogenoates in ethanol within a short reaction time. In vitro antimicrobial study along with statistical analysis and seed germination assay were performed. These chalcogenophosphates possess strong antimicrobial activity against the reference strains. The antibacterial activity was determined against four standard strains (Bacilus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The antifungal activity was evaluated against one fungal strain Candida albicans.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685541","annotations":[{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.850131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.678266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Aryl","weight":0.615849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl"},{"name":"Germination","weight":0.455423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.447778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Benzyl","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzyl"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Green chemistry","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_chemistry"}]}
