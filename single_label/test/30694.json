{"id":30694,"title":"[MR imaging late changes of brain after carbon monoxide poisoning--case report].","abstract":"We present the case of 28 years old patient hospitalized at the Regional Center of Clinical Toxicology in Lublin after carbon monoxide poisoning. The level of carboxyhemoglobin was 33.3%. Because of neurological symptoms MR of brain was performed with normal result. During hospitalization the progression of clinical symptoms was observed and the patient underwent control MR of brain. The result was abnormal and show changes bilaterally in white matter.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466715","annotations":[{"name":"Brain","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.705364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.623185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.506108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide poisoning","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Lublin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lublin"},{"name":"Carboxyhemoglobin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxyhemoglobin"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anatomical position","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_position"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
