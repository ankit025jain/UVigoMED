{"id":79023,"title":"[Analysis of genotype-phenotype correlation for GJB2 in 221 non-syndromic deafness probands and their pedigrees].","abstract":"To assess the possible genotype-phenotype correlation for GJB2.Retrospectively analyzed GJB2 gene mutations with non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) patients and their families audiological data. Individuals were grouped, according to non-truncated mutant (non-truncating, NT) and truncating mutations (truncating, T), into T/T group, T/NT group and NT/NT group. And according to whether they carry 235delC, grouped into 235delC/235delC group, 235delC/Non-235del group and Non-235delC/Non-235delC group.Grouped according to whether the truncation mutants:Fisher exact statistical analysis showed that the degree of hearing loss among the three groups did not meet the random distribution (P = 0.003) , T/T group was significantly higher than T/NT group (P = 0.000) and NT/NT group (P = 0.000) on the degree of hearing loss. Grouped according to whether they carry 235delC mutation: degrees of hearing loss among the three groups were statistically significant differences. Respectively pairwise comparisons (Fisher exact test) found 235delC/235delC group was significantly higher than 235delC/Non-235delC on the degree of hearing loss group (P = 0.001) and Non-235delC/Non-235delC group (P = 0.000), 235delC/Non-235delC group higher than Non-235delC/Non-235delC group (P = 0.033). In GJB2 mutations homozygous and compound heterozygous mutation genotype:G109A/G109A, 235delC/512insAACG, 299delAT/G109A and 235delC/G109A degree of hearing loss caused by genotype was significantly lower than 235delC/235delC group.235delC homozygotes have significantly more hearing impairment, when compared with 235delC/non-235delC compound heterozygotes. People with two non-235delC mutations have even less hearing impairment. Patients with non-truncation mutants (G109A) suffer from lighter hearing loss than truncation mutations(235delC, 299delAT).","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506997","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.752828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.735874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.701299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.461221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.312002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.236367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Pedigree chart","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Nonsyndromic deafness","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsyndromic_deafness"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0652231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"GJB2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GJB2"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Compound heterozygosity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_heterozygosity"},{"name":"235","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/235"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Truncation (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry)"},{"name":"Pairwise comparison","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_comparison"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Lighter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter"},{"name":"China National Highway 109","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Highway_109"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Railways Act 1921","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railways_Act_1921"}]}
