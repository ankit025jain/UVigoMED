{"id":88507,"title":"Osteoporosis and fragility fractures: Vertebral fractures.","abstract":"The incidence of vertebral fragility fractures and deformity increase steeply with age. Every sixth woman and every twelfth man will sustain a symptomatic vertebral fracture. Vertebral fractures result in pain, functional disability and decreased quality of life, which may last for several years, and may also affect mortality. The patient with an acute fracture should be examined with radiology for diagnosis. In case of a low-energy fracture, osteoporosis should be suspected and investigated. If the pain management fails, vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty could be considered. Braces may be used, but evidence for its effect is lacking. In the rare event of neurological compromise, or unstable fractures, surgical treatment should be considered. After vertebral fragility fractures, the risk for new fractures is high and secondary preventive measures advocated. The best evidence for secondary prevention is currently on medical treatment of osteoporosis.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836333","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.771817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.647855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.629798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0608789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.0294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
