{"id":60256,"title":"T2 magnetic resonance: a diagnostic platform for studying integrated hemostasis in whole blood--proof of concept.","abstract":"Existing approaches for measuring hemostasis parameters require multiple platforms, can take hours to provide results, and generally require 1-25 mL of sample. We developed a diagnostic platform that allows comprehensive assessment of hemostatic parameters on a single instrument and provides results within 15 min using 0.04 mL of blood with minimal sample handling.T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) was used to directly measure integrated reactions in whole blood samples by resolving multiple water relaxation times from distinct sample microenvironments. Clotting, clot contraction, and fibrinolysis stimulated by thrombin or tissue plasminogen activator, respectively, were measured. T2MR signals of clotting samples were compared with images produced by scanning electron microscopy and with standard reference methods for the following parameters: hematocrit, prothrombin time, clot strength, and platelet activity.Application of T2MR methodology revealed conditions under which a unique T2MR signature appeared that corresponded with the formation of polyhedral erythrocytes, the dynamics and morphology of which are dependent on thrombin, fibrinogen, hematocrit, and platelet levels. We also showed that the T2MR platform can be used for precise and accurate measurements of hematocrit (%CV, 4.8%, R(2) = 0.95), clotting time (%CV, 3.5%, R(2) = 0.94), clot strength (R(2) = 0.95), and platelet function (93% agreement with light transmission aggregometry).This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that T2MR has the potential to provide rapid and sensitive identification of patients at risk for thrombosis or bleeding and to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets with a single, simple-to-employ analytic approach that may be suitable for routine use in both research and diverse clinical settings.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24958814","annotations":[{"name":"Prothrombin
