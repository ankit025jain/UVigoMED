{"id":24476,"title":"The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.","abstract":"Metabolic syndrome is a multifaceted disorder strongly associated with increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease. Chronic inflammatory diseases have been associated with metabolic syndrome. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with significant physical and emotional sequelae.We sought to investigate a possible association between hidradenitis suppurativa and metabolic syndrome.A retrospective chart review of all dermatology clinic encounters over an 18-month period identified 366 patients with an appropriate diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa. A control population was created from patients seen in the same clinic during the same time period for the diagnoses of either keloids or verruca vulgaris using the matching criteria of age Â±5 years, race, and gender. All participants were examined for characteristics of the metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Program III guidelines.The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa was 50.6%, which was significantly higher than the control group at 30.2% (P < .001).This was a retrospective review. Some participants could not be analyzed for metabolic syndrome presence as a result of missing data points.Our results indicate that patients with hidradenitis suppurativa may be at high risk for metabolic syndrome.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433875","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.877613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"National Cholesterol Education Program","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cholesterol_Education_Program"},{"name":"Hidradenitis suppurativa","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa"},{"name":"Wart","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wart"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.338197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Age of consent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Plantar wart","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_wart"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
