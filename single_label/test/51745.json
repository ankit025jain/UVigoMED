{"id":51745,"title":"The use of core needle biopsy as first-line in diagnosis of thyroid nodules reduces false negative and inconclusive data reported by fine-needle aspiration.","abstract":"The reported reliability of core needle biopsy (CNB) is high in assessing thyroid nodules after inconclusive fine-needle aspiration (FNA) attempts. However, first-line use of CNB for nodules considered at risk by ultrasonography (US) has yet to be studied. The aim of this study were: 1) to evaluate the potential merit of using CNB first-line instead of conventional FNA in thyroid nodules with suspicious ultrasonographic features; 2) to compare CNB and FNA as a first-line diagnostic procedure in thyroid lesions at higher risk of cancer.Seventy-seven patients with a suspicious-appearing, recently discovered solid thyroid nodule were initially enrolled as study participants. No patients had undergone prior thyroid fine-needle aspiration/biopsy. Based on study design, all patients were proposed to undergo CNB as first-line diagnostic aspiration, while those patients refusing to do so underwent conventional FNA.Five patients refused the study, and a total of 31 and 41 thyroid nodules were subjected to CNB and FNA, respectively. At follow-up, the overall rate of malignancy was of 80% (CNB, 77%; FNA, 83%). However, the diagnostic accuracy of CNB (97%) was significantly (P?<?0.05) higher than that of FNA (78%). In one benign lesion, CNB was inconclusive. Four (12%) of the 34 cancers of the FNA group were not initially diagnosed because of false negative (N?=?1), indeterminate (N?=?2) or not adequate (N?=?1) samples.CNB can reduce the false negative and inconclusive results of conventional FNA and should be considered a first-line method in assessing solid thyroid nodules at high risk of malignancy.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661377","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.616083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.613322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.356146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.107842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cosmic neutrino background","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_neutrino_background"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"N2 road (South Africa)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N2_road_(South_Africa)"}]}
