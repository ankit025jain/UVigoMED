{"id":32002,"title":"[Minor physical anomalies in the relatives of schizophrenia patients. A systematic review of the literature].","abstract":"Minor physical anomalies are mild, clinically and cosmetically insignificant errors of morphogenesis which have a prenatal origin and may bear major informational value for diagnostic, prognostic and epidemiological purposes. Since both the central nervous system and the skin are derived from the same ectodermal tissue in utero, minor physical anomalies can be external markers of abnormal brain development and they appear more commonly in neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently studies were published on the prevalence of minor physical anomalies in the relatives of patients with schizophrenia. In a systematic review of literature 11 studies were identified with mixed results. We suppose that the differentiation of minor malformations and phenogenetic variants can help to clarify the minor anomaly profile as a potential endophenotype in schizophrenia.
