{"id":9127,"title":"Pharmacological options to protect the aged heart from ischemia and reperfusion injury by targeting the PKA-BK(Ca) signaling pathway.","abstract":"The beneficial effects of many cardioprotective strategies including ischemic or pharmacological conditioning are reduced in the aged heart. The underlying reason(s) for the age-dependent loss of cardioprotection is unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that protein kinase A (PKA) dependent cardioprotection is lost in the aged heart. However, activation of large-conductance Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) (BK(Ca)) channels, a putative PKA downstream target, initiated cardioprotection also in the aged heart. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether 1) BK(Ca) channels are critically involved in PKA activation induced cardioprotection and 2) the age-dependent loss of cardioprotection is caused by differences in PKA regulation. Using an in vivo rat model with regional myocardial ischemia, we treated young (2-4 months) and aged (22-24 months) Wistar rats with PKA activator forskolin, BK(Ca) channel activator NS1619 and/or BK(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin. Forskolin induced infarct size reduction was 1) age-dependent and 2) prevented by iberiotoxin. The effect of forskolin on myocardial PKA activity was comparable in young and aged animals. In addition, NS1619 initiated cardioprotection also in the aged heart both when administered before ischemia and during early reperfusion phase. Activation of BK(Ca) channels is critically involved in forskolin induced cardioprotection. The age-dependency of forskolin induced cardioprotection is not caused by age-dependent differences in PKA activation. Pharmacological targeting of BK(Ca) channels before or after myocardial ischemia is a promising therapeutic strategy to protect the aged heart from ischemia and reperfusion injury.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727217","annotations":[{"name":"Protein kinase A","weight":0.904407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.677836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.623117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.48835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.413787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.309829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.303847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.300978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Forskolin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forskolin"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
