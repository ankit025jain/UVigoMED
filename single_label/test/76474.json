{"id":76474,"title":"[Trends on the prevalence rates of obesity and cardiometabolic among children and adolescents in Beijing, during 2004-2013].","abstract":"To analyze the trends on the prevalence rates of obesity and cardiometabolic among children and adolescents in Beijing, during 2004-2013.Data was collected from three cross-sectional studies among children and adolescents, aged 7-17 years old in Beijing. Two studies in 2004 and 2013 were conducted in general population, and one was among obese children in 2007. Data on anthropometric measurements including weight, height, and age was collected from all the subjects. The obese children from all three studies underwent a clinic examination that containing blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile (TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C), and acanthosis nigricans. Liver transaminases detection (ALT and AST) and liver ultrasound examination were performed in obese children from surveys in 2007 and 2013.The prevalence of severe obesity increased from 1.86% in 2004 to 4.17% in 2013, with an annual increase rate as 0.26%. The proportion of severe obesity in obesity increased from 18.92% in 2004 to 25.15% in 2013. After adjusting for age and gender, the prevalence of IFG, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C in both obese children and adolescents increased during 2004-2013 (all P < 0.05). The prevalence rates of hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and acanthosis nigricans in severe obese children were higher than those in moderate obesity. The proportion of children with 2 or more cardiometabolic risk factors in severe obese children was higher than in moderate obese children.The prevalence rates of obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors among children and adolescents in Beijing showed an increase during 2004-2013.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009022","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertriglyceridemia","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertriglyceridemia"},{"name":"Acanthosis nigricans","weight":0.837788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthosis_nigricans"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.566187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.523569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.362601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.223258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
