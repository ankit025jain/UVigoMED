{"id":35523,"title":"Differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease: what the clinician should know.","abstract":"Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal-dominant illness caused by an expansion of the CAG repeats on the short arm of chromosome 4, is clinically characterized by a combination of movement disorders, cognitive decline and behavioral changes. HD accounts for 90-99% of patients who present with this clinical picture. The remaining patients that are negative for the HD genetic mutation are said to have HD phenocopies. Autosomal-dominant diseases that can mimic HD are HD-like 2, C9orf72 mutations, spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (HD-like 4), benign hereditary chorea, neuroferritinopathy (neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type 3), dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy and HD-like 1. There are also autosomal-recessive choreas that can be HD phenocopies: Friedreich's ataxia, neuroacanthocytosis, several forms of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, ataxia telangiectasia, HD-like 3 and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. Among X?linked conditions, McLeod syndrome can mimic the clinical features of HD. Although less frequently, sporadic conditions, such as tardive dyskinesia and non-Wilsonian hepatolenticular degeneration, can also mimic HD.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640980","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroacanthocytosis","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroacanthocytosis"},{"name":"Wilson's disease","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease"},{"name":"Tardive dyskinesia","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar ataxia","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_ataxia"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Apraxia","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apraxia"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Movement disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_disorder"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Choreia (disease)","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreia_(disease)"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Trinucleotide repeat disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinucleotide_repeat_disorder"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.632123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian_atrophy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.458563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.434501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Chromosome 4 (human)","weight":0.397759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_4_(human)"},{"name":"McLeod syndrome","weight":0.308333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod_syndrome"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Telangiectasia","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangiectasia"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Orf (disease)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orf_(disease)"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar tract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_tract"},{"name":"Oculomotor nerve","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculomotor_nerve"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
