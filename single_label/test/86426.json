{"id":86426,"title":"[Cardiac comorbidity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and economics].","abstract":"To provide a clinical and economic rationale for the comprehensive examination of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by using functional and ultrasound methods for the early detection of cardiac comorbidity.Three hundred and sixteen patients (33 with COPD, 44 with COPD + hypertension, 73 with COPD + coronary heart disease (CHD), 36 with hypertension, 50 with CHD, 19 with asthma, and 28 with asthma + hypertension) and 33 apparently healthy individuals were examined using 611 indicators obtained directly or by calculation during echocardiography, carotid artery duplex scanning, and 24-hour electrocardiographic (ECG) and blood pressure (BP) monitoring.Cardiovascular diseases develop in patients with COPD in its early stages. In cardiac comorbidity, the length of hospital stay increases by 1-1.5 days in patients with COPD; the number of people admitted to hospital more than once every 3 years rises from 14 to 28%; the cost of a pharmacotherapy cycle is 1.35- and 2.95-fold higher when COPD is concurrent with hypertension and CHD, respectively.In addition to ECG and spirometry, the management standard for patients with COPD should include echocardiography, 24-hour ECG and BP monitoring, and, according to their results, carotid artery duplex scanning.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779066","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.705757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.519937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.490652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cardiac marker","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_marker"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.159096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"}]}
