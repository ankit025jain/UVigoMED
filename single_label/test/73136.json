{"id":73136,"title":"[The role of tumoral stroma in prognosis of course of luminal mammary gland cancer type A].","abstract":"Peculiarities of tumoral stroma, the indices of overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were studied up in patients, suffering luminal mammarial gland cancer MGC type A. If the stroma have had occupied more than 50% of the tumor square, the OS and DFS indices were the highest. The link was established between the OS and DFS indices, the stromal square and expression of the MGC cells toward the estrogen and progesterone receptors. The pronounced stromal reaction was connected with the OS index improvement even in a less pronounced expression to estrogen and progesterone.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923148","annotations":[{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.784752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.599889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Stroma (animal tissue)","weight":0.208638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_(animal_tissue)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"List of grape diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_diseases"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"}]}
