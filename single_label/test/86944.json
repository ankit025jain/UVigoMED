A mistaken translation of disease name into Russian as \"lishai\" is emphasized. Recommendations on the complex, stage-by-stage treatment of patients, including psychotherapeutic treatment of the pain syndrome, are presented.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176269","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.766623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.549091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"History","weight":0.227397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Herpes zoster","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Rare species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_species"},{"name":"Exanthem","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exanthem"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
