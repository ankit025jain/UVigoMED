{"id":82567,"title":"GALNT2 enhances migration and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma by regulating EGFR glycosylation and activity.","abstract":"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide. Aberrant glycosylation affects many cellular properties in cancers, including OSCC. This study aimed to explore the role of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GALNT2) in OSCC.Immunohistochemistry was performed to study the expression of GALNT2 in an OSCC tissue microarray. Effects of GALNT2 overexpression and knockdown on cell migration and invasion were analyzed in SAS cells by transwell migration assay and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. The Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA) pull down assay was conducted to detect changes in O-glycans on acceptor substrates of GALNT2. Cell signaling was analyzed by Western blotting.GALNT2 was overexpressed in 73% (35/48) of OSCC tissues. Moreover, GALNT2 expression was localized in the invasive front and increased in high grade OSCC. GALNT2 overexpression enhanced migration and invasion of SAS cells triggered by fetal bovine serum (FBS) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). In contrast, GALNT2 knockdown inhibited SAS cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, GALNT2 overexpression enhanced VVA binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT. Conversely, GALNT2 knockdown decreased VVA binding and suppressed activity of EGFR and AKT.GALNT2 is frequently overexpressed in OSCC, especially in the carcinoma cells at the invasive front. GALNT2 overexpression enhances the invasive potential of OSCC cells via modifying O-glycosylation and activity of EGFR. These findings suggest that GALNT2 plays an important role in the invasive behavior of OSCC and that targeting GALNT2 could be a promising approach for OSCC therapy.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582885","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.90235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.845868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.82729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.744544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.53219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.275209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0463236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Electron acceptor","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_acceptor"},{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Chemotaxis assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis_assay"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Fetal bovine serum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
