{"id":87107,"title":"HIV prevalence and high-risk sexual behaviours among MSM repeat and first-time testers in China: implications for HIV prevention.","abstract":"Little is known about HIV testing, HIV infection and sexual behaviour among bathhouse patrons in China. This study aims to assess differences in HIV prevalence and high-risk sexual behaviours between repeat and first-time testers among men who have sex with men (MSM) attending bathhouse in Tianjin, China.Between March 2011 and September 2012, a HIV voluntary counselling and testing station was established in a gay bathhouse, which provided HIV testing and conducted a survey among participants recruited through snowball sampling. Differences in demographic and high-risk sexual behaviours between repeat and first-time testers were assessed using the chi-square test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors for HIV infection.Of the 1642 respondents, 699 (42.6%) were repeat testers and 943 (57.4%) were first-time testers. Among repeat testers, a higher proportion were men aged 18 to 25, single, better educated, had a history of STIs and worked as male sex workers or \"money boys\" (MBs). Repeat testers were less likely to report having unprotected anal intercourse in the past six months. The overall HIV prevalence was 12.4% (203/1642). There was no difference in HIV prevalence between repeat (11.2%, 78/699) and first-time (13.3%, 125/943) testers. The HIV prevalence increased with age among first-time testers (?(2)trend=9.816, p=0.002). First-time MB testers had the highest HIV prevalence of 34.5%.MSM attending bathhouse had an alarmingly high HIV infection rate, particularly in MB. Targeted interventions are urgently needed especially focusing on older MSM and MBs.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993457","annotations":[{"name":"Gay bathhouse","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bathhouse"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Sex worker","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Gay","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"China","weight":0.666115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.556969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.545358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Male prostitution","weight":0.507173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_prostitution"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.418165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.402379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Public bathing","weight":0.31968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_bathing"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Patronage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage"},{"name":"Tianjin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Radio broadcasting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting"},{"name":"List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_HIV/AIDS_adult_prevalence_rate"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
