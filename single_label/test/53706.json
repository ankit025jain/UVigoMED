{"id":53706,"title":"[Control of treatment efficacy in patients with diabetic foot syndrome and peripheral angiopathy].","abstract":"The preparation of deproteinized hemoderivate, obtained from the calf blood, was used in complex of treatment of the patients, suffering the ischemic forms of the diabetic foot syndrome (DFS). The impact of treatment on a partial pressure of the oxygen (TcPO2) on the foot back was studied up. In noncritical ischemia of the lower extremities tissues there were established a trustworthy increase of TcPO2 in patients as well as a positive dynamics of the wounds healing. In a critical ischemia the results are heterogenous due to presence of coexistant factors, although a stable positive effect was noted.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502008","annotations":[{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.7963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.347671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.258263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.247918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.134162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Calf (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Angiopathy","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiopathy"}]}
