{"id":58598,"title":"Nicotine exposure increases the complexity of dopamine neurons in the parainterfascicular nucleus (PIF) sub-region of VTA.","abstract":"Recent publications highlight differences within the sub-regions of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) including the parabrachial pigmented nucleus (PBP), parainterfascicular nucleus (PIF) and paranigral nucleus (PN) in the projections to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the glutamatergic pathway.In order to characterize the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on the mesocorticolimbic system of the rat offspring, local field potentials were recorded from 27 sites across the VTA of 9 rats aged 40-55 days. The extracellular VTA neural activities were analyzed using Approximate Entropy (ApEn) method. Approximate entropy values were then grouped according to each anatomic location including the PBP, PIF and PN.Our results have shown that the local field potentials corresponding to the neurons located in the PIF region of the VTA have ApEn values significantly higher (p?=?2x10-4) in the maternal nicotine cases when compared to the saline.Therefore, we speculate that the dopamine neurons located in the PIF sub-region of the VTA are very likely involved with the nicotine addiction.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920473","annotations":[{"name":"Ventral tegmental area","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral_tegmental_area"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Prefrontal cortex","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.707462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.600869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Mesocortical pathway","weight":0.562072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesocortical_pathway"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Ventral","weight":0.533671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.424734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.371803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Entropy","weight":0.264178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy"},{"name":"Biological pigment","weight":0.229769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_pigment"},{"name":"Tegmentum","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegmentum"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Local field potential","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_field_potential"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Neural pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
