{"id":80508,"title":"LPS and inactivated Propionibacterium acnes elicit a partially protective response in primary infections of Heligmosomoides polygyrus.","abstract":"Intestinal helminth infections are common and of paramount economic importance in domestic animals. Available chemotherapy is limited and anthelmintic resistance is widespread in some hosts. This scenario favors the exploration of alternative methods of control, among them immune modulators. The effect of Escherichia coli LPS+Propionibacterium acnes on a primary infection of Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Trichostongyloidea) in mice has been tested. Nematode infection induced a rise of specific IgG1, both serum and intestinal, and a significant reduction in the unspecific (ConA) lymphoproliferative response. Treatment with the immune modulator (days -2, 0, 7 and 14 post infection) elicited an apparent delay of larval intramucosal development. Moreover cumulative nematode egg shedding in treated mice was significantly lower (p=0.0041). Preliminary results point toward the interest of immune modulators to control intestinal helminths.
