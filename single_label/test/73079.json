{"id":73079,"title":"Vascular soft-tissue sarcomas: a prognostic model from a retrospective single-center study.","abstract":"Vascular soft-tissue sarcomas are a rare form of sarcoma. Malignant subtypes exhibit a variety of biological behaviors. We describe the clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival outcomes of malignant vascular soft-tissue sarcomas.We conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of 84 patients diagnosed with vascular tumors by histological examination at the Yonsei University College of Medicine between April 1987 and August 2011. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).The angiosarcoma patients had a significantly shorter OS than the patients with other subtypes of sarcomas (59.0 and 142.7 months, respectively; p < 0.001). Upon multivariate analysis of survival in patients who underwent surgical resection, the following independent prognostic factors were identified: primary site (trunk, p = 0.001), age (older than 65 years, p < 0.001), pathology (angiosarcoma, p = 0.006) and R2 resection (p = 0.002).The independent prognostic factors for shorter survival are the trunk as the primary site, malignant angiosarcoma and age (>65 years). Complete excision should be attempted for providing a survival advantage in the patients with localized disease. In addition, bleeding episodes are much more frequent in patients with a poor survival outcome.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925021","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.751207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.641371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.44906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.320957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.298984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.264512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Angiosarcoma","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiosarcoma"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival of the fittest","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"1987","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"University College London","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Localized disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localized_disease"}]}
