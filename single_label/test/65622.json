{"id":65622,"title":"Hematologic changes during prostate cancer radiation therapy are dependent on the treatment volume.","abstract":"To assess hematologic changes of modern prostate radiation therapy (RT) comparing different target volumes.Blood samples were evaluated before (T1), during (T2-T4) and 6-8 weeks after (T5) RT in a group of 113 patients. Whole-pelvic RT up to 46 Gy was applied in 27 cases. The total dose to the prostatic fossa (n = 46)/prostate (n = 67) was 66/76 Gy.Erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet levels decreased significantly relative to baseline levels at T2-T5. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy had an impact on hemoglobin levels before and during RT. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 leukopenia was 15 versus 2% (p = 0.02) and grade 2 anemia 8 versus 0% (p = 0.03) with versus without whole-pelvic RT, respectively. Lymphocyte decrease was larger at times T2-T5 (36 vs 3% grade 3 toxicity; p < 0.01).Prostate RT has a small but significant and longer effect on the blood count. Lower lymphocyte levels need to be considered when larger volumes are treated.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799064","annotations":[{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.88752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.862887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.481792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.380868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0763854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
