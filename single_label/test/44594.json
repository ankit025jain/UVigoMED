{"id":44594,"title":"Identification of na√Øve HVC-4 patients who may be treated with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin according to IL28B polymorphisms.","abstract":"The current treatment of HCV-4 patients is dual therapy with PEG-IFN and ribavirin; however, new drugs against this genotype will be available within few months. Despite the evidenced good virological response in IFN-free regimens, the high cost of these new therapies will require patient selection. In our paper we propose the use of both rs8099917 and rs12979860 IL28-B polymorphisms, in order to identify potentially categories of SVR, null-responder and relapse and consequently to choose the dual therapy or novel approach.One hundred and sixty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis C and genotype 4 treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48weeks were retrospectively studied. All patients were genotyped for rs8099917 and rs12979860 interleukin-28B polymorphisms.80 patients with SVR (88.8%) had the TT/CC or TT/TC (rs8099917/rs12979860) (p<0.001) genotypes; the null-responders (n=13), 9 (69.2%) showed the GG/TT allelic distribution (p<0.001); relapsers showed a prevalent distribution of the TG/TC genotype (83.3%) (p<0.001). The 6 (100%) breakthrough patients showed TT/TC genotype, while the partial responders patients did not show any particular IL-28B genetic profile. Genetic profiles different from TT/CC showed 94.9% negative predictive value for SVR, with 92.6% of sensitivity and 65.2% of specificity. Insulin-resistance, diabetes and liver fibrosis were not relevant in our multivariate analysis.The combination of both rs8099917/rs12979860 polymorphisms is useful for early identification of SVR, null-responders and relapsers. This could be used to chose between standard dual therapy or novel approach with IFN-free regimens.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726902","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.590746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.44906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.410378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.214112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
