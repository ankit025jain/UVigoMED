{"id":84768,"title":"No evidence for phylogenetic constraint on natural defense evolution among wild tomatoes.","abstract":"Plant defense traits can be shaped by evolutionary and physiological constraints, as well as local ecological selection. We assessed the relative importance of these factors in shaping defense trait variation across the wild tomato clade (a group of 13 closely related species) using an herbivore bioassay (Manduca sexta). With phylogenetic comparative methods, we evaluated patterns of constitutive and induced defense variation, and the extent of coupling between alternative defense strategies. We detected substantial variation among species and found no evidence for phylogenetic conservatism among defensive traits, unlike for two other ecologically relevant (reproductive) traits. In addition, constitutive and induced defense syndromes were unassociated. These data indicate that, in this group, there is no evidence for either phylogenetic conservatism of shared consumer guilds that shape defense traits, or for constraints on defense trait evolution, including mechanistic trade-offs between defense strategies. Our data suggest that defense trait variation in this clade instead results from rapid responses to local ecological conditions.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039227","annotations":[{"name":"Phylogenetic comparative methods","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_comparative_methods"},{"name":"Herbivore","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore"},{"name":"Clade","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.737578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Tomato","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Biological interaction","weight":0.383031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_interaction"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Comparative method","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_method"},{"name":"Bioassay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay"},{"name":"Ecological selection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_selection"},{"name":"Lycopersicon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopersicon"},{"name":"Manduca sexta","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manduca_sexta"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Guild","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Comparative linguistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_linguistics"},{"name":"Manduca","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manduca"}]}
