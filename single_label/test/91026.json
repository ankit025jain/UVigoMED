{"id":91026,"title":"Nontraumatic acute aortic emergencies: Part 2, Pre- and postsurgical complications related to aortic aneurysm in the emergency clinical setting.","abstract":"The aim of this article is to illustrate the imaging findings and spectrum of disease entities affecting the aorta. The clinical presentation and assessment of acute aortic pathology can be elusive or deceptive, making the diagnosis challenging. The widespread availability of advanced cross-sectional imaging technology in the emergency setting puts the radiologist at the forefront of accurate and timely diagnosis.Cross-sectional imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and delineation of aortic pathology. Awareness of the imaging findings and complications can help in swift and accurate diagnosis.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555606","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.768634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.707957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.584048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.566711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.508502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.0972222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Deception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception"},{"name":"Swift","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
