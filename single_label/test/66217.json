{"id":66217,"title":"Inpatient and emergent resource use of patients on dialysis at an academic medical center.","abstract":"End-stage renal disease patients require resources for emergent and inpatient care in addition to ambulatory dialysis. There are two dialysis modalities and settings which patients switch between. Our aim was to characterize the patterns and reasons for switching, as well as the emergent and inpatient utilization of these patients at the University Health Network.Patients who received chronic dialysis between March 1, 2006, and April 30, 2011, were identified. Utilization was measured by emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and bed-days occupied per year.Out of 576 patients identified, 18.6% switched modality and/or setting. The majority of switches occurred during the first year of dialysis. Patients who switched had increased utilization compared to those on a continuous modality/setting. Overall, patients had a median rate of 0.91 ED visits per patient-year, compared to 1.56 for patients who switched modality and setting. Median inpatient bed resource requirement was 4.46 bed-days/patient-year overall, compared to 8.91 for patients who switched modality and setting.Emergent and inpatient utilization is related to the setting and modality of dialysis, although differences are partly explained by comorbidities. Patients who switch modalities use more resources and may be a prime population for interventions.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732261","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.746624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.654138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.648965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.404645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.403229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.350848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.32868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Inpatient care","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient_care"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Academic health science centre","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_health_science_centre"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"University Health Network","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Health_Network"},{"name":"April 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_30"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"March 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1"},{"name":"Prime number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"}]}
