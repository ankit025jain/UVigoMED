{"id":84931,"title":"[Subacute toxicity and chemical analysis of Tibetan medicine Oxytropis falcata].","abstract":"Four different extracts of Oxytropis falcata, including the aerial aqueous extract, and the underground aqueous extract, the aerial lipophilic extract, and the underground lipophilic extract were prepared and then administrated orally to mice at the maximum dose (50 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) calculated by raw material) for fifteen days respectively. Compared with the control group, which was administrated of 1.0% tween-80, the treatment groups did not show significant differences in appearance and behavior. However, the organcoefficient, blood biochemical indicator and pathological section results showed that the lipophilic extracts of the aerial and underground parts of O. flacata showed mild injury to the liver of mice, while the aerial and underground aqueous extracts and the underground lipophilic extract showed mild toxicity to the kidney of male mice. Chemical analysis showed that the lipophilic extracts of the aerial and underground parts, especially aerial lipophilic extract, consisted of large amount of flavonoid aglycones with little amount of polysaccharides and proteins, while the aqueous extracts contained much polysaccharides and proteins with almost no flavonoid aglycones detected.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011246","annotations":[{"name":"Lipophilicity","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophilicity"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.721059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.528507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.481512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.450542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.328977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Raw material","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.111585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Aglycone","weight":0.0347132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglycone"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Tibet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet"},{"name":"Antenna (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)"},{"name":"Black market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"}]}
