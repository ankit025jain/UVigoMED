{"id":33697,"title":"Congenital ductus arteriosus aneurysm: an unusual cause of transient neonatal hypertension.","abstract":"Case 1: A term male child was re-admitted on day 10 of life due to acute onset of respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed tachypnoea, tachycardia and blood pressure (BP) above the 95th centile in all four limbs. Cardiovascular examination revealed a short systolic murmur on the sternal border. Abdomen showed hepatomegaly of 3 cm below the costal margin. Chest X-ray showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.65 with normal vascularity. Ultrasound and Doppler of the kidneys and brain were normal. The high parasternal view showed a large ductus arteriosus aneurysm (DAA) of 2.0 × 2.5 cm. The baby was managed with inotropes and antihypertensives. CT angiogram showed 1.6 × 0.6 cm thrombosed DAA, which was extending from the posterior descending aorta to the ampulla. With the resolution of aneurysm BPs normalised and antihypertensives were stopped at 6 weeks of age. Case 2: A premature male neonate weighing 1.2 kg was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress syndrome. On the 4th day of life during routine measurement of vitals, the BP was consistently above 95th centile in all four limbs. Blood tests revealed thrombocytopenia that persisted inspite of single donor transfusions. The evaluation for sepsis was negative. The ultrasound and Dopplers of the kidneys and brain were all normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large DAA measuring 5 × 1.8 mm. Hypertension was managed with antihypertensives. Serial transthoracic echocardiogram showed organising DAA. CT angiogram showed 6 mm × 2 mm thrombosed DAA. As the arterial BP normalised, antihypertensives were stopped on day 15 of life. The baby was discharged on day 29 of life and on follow-up BP remained normal.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
