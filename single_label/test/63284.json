{"id":63284,"title":"Bendamustine as monotherapy and in combination regimens for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-hodgkin lymphoma: a retrospective analysis.","abstract":"In this study, we carried out a retrospective analysis of the efficacy and toxicity of bendamustine in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases.Bendamustine was administered both as monotherapy and in combined protocols to 92 patients, including 76 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 16 patients with indolent lymphomas. Bendamustine plus rituximab was used to treat 65.2% of the patients, and 34.8% of the patients received bendamustine as monotherapy.The overall response rate was 64.2%, including the complete response rate (18.5%) and the partial response rate (45.7%). The median overall survival (OS) was 11.5 months. Among the pretreatment parameters, ??-microglobulin (RR = 1.413; p = 0.001) and hemoglobin levels (RR = 0.85; p = 0.03) significantly influenced survival. The OS was significantly longer in patients who received ?2 lines of previous therapy compared to >3 lines (p = 0.043; log-rank test) and those who received ?4 courses of therapy with bendamustine (p = 0.0007; log-rank test). Toxicity was predominantly hematological, including grade III/IV neutropenia in 33.7%, thrombocytopenia in 13%, and anemia in 13% of patients.Bendamustine, both in monotherapy and in combination regimens, is an effective therapy with a favorable toxicity profile in patients with indolent B-cell malignancies.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457828","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Bendamustine","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendamustine"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.795801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.751055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.321274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.307745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
