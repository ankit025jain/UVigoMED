{"id":58666,"title":"The mortality risk of expectant management compared with delivery stratified by gestational age and race and ethnicity.","abstract":"The objective of the study was to compare the mortality risk of expectant management with the risk of delivery at each week of term pregnancy in 4 racial/ethnic groups.This was a retrospective cohort study of all nonanomalous, term deliveries in California from 1997 to 2006 among white, black, Hispanic, and Asian women. In each racial/ethnic group, we compared the risk of infant death at each week with a composite risk representing the mortality risk of 1 week of expectant management.The risk of stillbirth and infant death is highest in black women (stillbirth risk: 18.0 per 10,000, infant death: 24.4 per 10,000, compared with 9.4 per 10,000 and 10.8 per 10,000 in white women, respectively; P < .001). Although absolute risks differ by race/ethnicity, the composite risk of expectant management does not surpass the risk of delivery until 39 weeks in any group. At 39 weeks these absolute risk differences are low, however, with a number needed to deliver to prevent 1 death ranging from 751 (among black women) to 2587 (among Asian women).The mortality risk of expectant management exceeds the risk of delivery at 39 weeks in all racial/ethnic groups, despite variation in absolute risks.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909340","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.559225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.54065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"California","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.437525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.319056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Stillbirth","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth"},{"name":"Infant mortality","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Black","weight":0.132302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Absolute monarchy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Absolute risk reduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_risk_reduction"},{"name":"List of postage stamps of Pakistan from 1997 to 2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postage_stamps_of_Pakistan_from_1997_to_2006"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
