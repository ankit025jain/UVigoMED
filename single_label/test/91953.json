{"id":91953,"title":"[Use of misoprostol for induction of labor in case of fetal death or termination of pregnancy during second or third trimester of pregnancy: Efficiency, dosage, route of administration, side effects, use in case of uterine scar].","abstract":"Study, based on the literature, of the use of misoprostol for induction of labor in cases of second or third trimester fetal death or termination of pregnancy and define the different mode of administration.Bibliographic review using the Medline and Pubmed databases and the guidelines of the international professional societies. Selection of papers in French and English. Keywords used: misoprostol, termination of pregnancy, mid and third trimester, scarred uterus, previous cesarean section, uterine rupture.Misoprostol is effective for induction of labor in case of second or third fetal death or termination of pregnancy. Comparing to oral route, vaginal route reduces the induction-expulsion time and the rate of patients remaining undelivered in the first 24 hours without increasing side effects. Oral route is a possible alternative if preferred by the patient. Sublingual route seems interesting but data are limited. The use of moderate doses (800-2400 ?g/day) every 3 to 6 hours seems to be the best compromise between efficiency and tolerance. It is not possible to recommend a specific dosing schedule. The risk of uterine rupture in case of previous cesarean section justifies the use of minimum effective dose for these patients. In this case, it is recommended not to exceed a dose of 100 ?g for each dose. The induction-birth period and doses of misoprostol required to induce labor are reduced when combined with mifepristone administered 36 to 48 hours before.Misoprostol is effective and safe for induction of labor in case of second or third trimester fetal death or termination of pregnancy.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461423","annotations":[{"name":"Misoprostol","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.753863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Mifepristone","weight":0.731958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.69255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.571683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Uterine rupture","weight":0.537704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_rupture"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.525488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.411521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.285494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Third trimester","weight":0.274054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_trimester"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.146445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"France","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}]}
