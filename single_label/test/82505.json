{"id":82505,"title":"Two major mumps genotype G variants dominated recent mumps outbreaks in the Netherlands (2009-2012).","abstract":"During three seasons of mumps outbreaks in the Netherlands (September 2009-August 2012), 822 mumps cases were laboratory-confirmed at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Most patients were vaccinated young adults. Given the protracted endemic circulation, we studied the genetic diversity and changes of mumps virus over a period of 3 years. Phylogenetic analysis of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene (316 bp) was performed on a representative set of 808 specimens that tested positive for mumps via PCR. Additionally, the haemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) gene (1749 bp) and fusion (F) gene (1617 bp) were sequenced for a subset of samples (n = 17). Correlations between different sequence types and epidemiological and clinical data were investigated. The outbreaks in the Netherlands were dominated by two SH gene sequence types within genotype G, termed MuVs/Delft.NLD/03.10 (variant 1) and MuVs/Scheemda.NLD/12.10 (variant 2). Sequence analysis of the HN and F genes indicated that the outbreaks were initiated by separately introduced genetic lineages. The predominance of variant 2 by the end of the first outbreak season could not be explained by any of the epidemiological factors investigated. Orchitis was more frequently reported in males infected with variant 2, irrespective of age and vaccination status. These findings illustrate genetic heterogeneity of an emerging mumps genotype, and raise questions about the mechanisms driving mumps epidemiology and immunity in relation to vaccination.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603524","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.678288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.662155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.639484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.635104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.58102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.52712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.370838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Mumps","weight":0.330556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.316699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_National_Institute_for_Public_Health_and_the_Environment"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Orchitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchitis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Honduras","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Driving (horse)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_(horse)"}]}
