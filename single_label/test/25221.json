{"id":25221,"title":"Molecular pathways of arterial aging.","abstract":"The incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction increases in aged patients and it is associated with an adverse outcome. Considering the aging population and the increasing incidence of cardiovascular disease, the prediction for population well-being and health economics is daunting. Accordingly, there is an unmet need to focus on fundamental processes underlying vascular aging. A better understanding of the pathways leading to arterial aging may contribute to design mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to prevent or attenuate features of vascular senescence. In the present review, we discuss advances in the pathophysiology of age-related vascular dysfunction including nitric oxide signalling, dysregulation of oxidant/inflammatory genes, epigenetic modifications and mechanisms of vascular calcification as well as insights into vascular repair. Such an overview highlights attractive molecular targets for the prevention of age-driven vascular disease.
