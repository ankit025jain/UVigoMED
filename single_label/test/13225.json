{"id":13225,"title":"NMDA and AMPA receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex mediates visceral pain in visceral hypersensitivity rats.","abstract":"Several studies have shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor activation in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons plays critical roles in modulating visceral pain responses in visceral hypersensitivity (VH) rats. However, there are few reports about the expressions of NMDA and ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isox-azolepropionic-acid (AMPA) receptor subtypes in ACC of VH model rats at different time points. The current study was undertaken to investigate NR2A, NR2B and GluR2 expressions in ACC of VH rats that were induced by administration with 5% mustard oil. Our results indicated that NR2B, but not NR2A, was highly expressed in VH model group on day 15, 22, and 36 compared with normal group (p < 0.05). GluR2 expression was also higher in VH model group on day 15, 22, and 36 than that of normal group (p < 0.05). These findings suggested increased expression of NR2B and GluR2 might be key mechanisms for long-term synaptic plastic changes in VH rats.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487031","annotations":[{"name":"Anterior cingulate cortex","weight":0.895066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"AMPA receptor","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA_receptor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Cingulate cortex","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cingulate_cortex"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-D-aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.560642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"AMPA","weight":0.548017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.367602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.296419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mustard oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_oil"},{"name":"GRIN2B","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIN2B"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Petroleum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Expression (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"},{"name":"GRIA2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIA2"},{"name":"Mustard plant","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_plant"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Holden VH Commodore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_VH_Commodore"},{"name":"2011 French Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_French_Open"},{"name":"Atlantic Coast Conference","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference"}]}
