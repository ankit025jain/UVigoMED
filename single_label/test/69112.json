{"id":69112,"title":"Clinical outcome of kidney transplantation from deceased donors with acute kidney injury by Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria.","abstract":"In this study, we investigated the outcome of kidney transplantation (KT) from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI), as defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria.Of 156 deceased donors, kidneys from 43 donors (27.6%) with AKI were transplanted into 57 recipients (AKI group). Another 147 recipients received kidneys from donors without AKI (non-AKI group). We compared the incidence of delayed graft function, allograft function for 1 year after KT, and long-term (5 and 10 years) graft survival rate between the 2 groups.Delayed graft function developed more frequently in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group (42.1% vs 12.2%; P<.05), and allograft function-assessed by the modification of diet in renal disease equation-showed a significantly deteriorating pattern at 2 weeks and 1, 3, and 6 months after KT compared with that in the non-AKI group (P<.05 for comparisons at each time point). However, allograft function at 12 months after KT and the long-term allograft and patient survival rates did not differ between the AKI and non-AKI groups.In KT from deceased donors, the AKI group that received kidneys with AKI, as defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, showed a higher delayed graft function rate and lower allograft function for 6 months after KT but no effect on allograft function 1 year after KT and on long-term allograft survival.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468572","annotations":[{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.838568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.817794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.676438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.646359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Order of the Thistle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Thistle"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Suplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Octane rating","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
