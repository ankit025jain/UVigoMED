{"id":66907,"title":"Avoidable hospitalizations in youth with kidney failure after transfer to or with only adult care.","abstract":"Hospital admissions for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (also called avoidable hospitalizations) are a measure of quality and access to outpatient care. We determined if young patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of avoidable hospitalizations.A national organ failure registry was used to identify patients with ESRD onset at <22 years of age between April 1, 2001, and March 31, 2010, who had received care in an adult care facility after age 15 years. The cohort was linked to the national hospitalizations database to identify avoidable hospitalizations relevant for young patients with ESRD. Patients were followed up until death, loss to follow-up, or study end. Two groups were studied: (1) patients transferred from pediatric to adult care; and (2) patients receiving ESRD care exclusively in adult centers. We determined the association between overall and avoidable hospitalization rates and both age and transfer status by using Poisson regression models.Our cohort included 349 patients. Among the 92 (26.4%) patients transferred to adult care during the study period, avoidable hospitalization rates were highest during the period 3 to <4 years after transfer (rate ratio: 3.19 [95% confidence interval: 1.42-7.18]) compared with the last year in pediatric care. Among the 257 (73.6%) patients who received ESRD care exclusively in adult centers, avoidable hospitalization rates increased with age.Among those who were transferred to adult care, avoidable hospitalization rates increased after transfer. Avoidable hospitalization rates increased with age in ESRD patients who received care in adult centers. Young patients with ESRD are at increased risk of avoidable hospitalizations.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664091","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.746414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.581855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.43155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.354163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.273912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.247364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.155471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.0322089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Elderly care","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderly_care"},{"name":"April 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_1"},{"name":"March 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_31"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Bit rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Organ (music)","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)"}]}
