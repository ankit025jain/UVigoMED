{"id":43254,"title":"Pyrosequencing evaluation of low-frequency KRAS mutant alleles for EGF receptor therapy selection in metastatic colorectal carcinoma.","abstract":"To evaluate whether pyrosequencing (PS) improves the KRAS mutational status predictive value.A retrospective analysis of KRAS mutations by PS and direct sequencing (DS) in 192 metastatic colorectal carcinomas (mCRCs), subgrouped in 51 KRAS mutated at PS and 141 KRAS wild-type at DS.DS failed to detect low-frequency KRAS mutations in four out of 51 mCRCs, whereas PS detected 12 additional low-frequency KRAS mutations in 141 mCRCs KRAS wild-type at DS. After reanalyzing by PS 97 KRAS wild-type tumors treated with anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) antibodies, nine additional mutations were revealed in nonresponders, whereas none of responders exhibited a KRAS-mutated genotype. Of note, KRAS-mutated tumors upon PS showed a worst progression-free survival after EGFR therapy. Finally, PS allowed the detection of additional NRAS, BRAF and exon 20 PIK3CA mutations mostly in KRAS wild-type mCRCs resistant to EGFR therapy.PS detection of low-frequency mutations may improve the KRAS predictive value for EGFR therapy selection.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799053","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.812614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.795711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.782219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.777501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.717131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.499751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.418381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"PIK3CA","weight":0.368633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIK3CA"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.312002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.259399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma_RAS_viral_oncogene_homolog"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Nintendo DS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Predictive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_medicine"},{"name":"Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyteknikkojen_Ilmailukerho"}]}
