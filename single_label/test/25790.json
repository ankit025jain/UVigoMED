{"id":25790,"title":"[Developments in percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary stents].","abstract":"In The Netherlands, more than 30.000 patients undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention every year, during which a coronary stent implantation will be performed in 90% of the cases. It is estimated that more than 5 million coronary stent implantations will be performed worldwide this year. While these numbers are impressive, however, coronary stents still have as a limitation the possibility of stent thrombosis. This has been and is an important stimulus for the development of both coronary stents, from a bare metal stent via a drug eluting stent to the present-day development of bio-absorbable stents, and anti-platelet drugs,from acenocoumarol to thieropyridines. The possibility of shortening the period of use of this powerful medication by developing new kinds of non-thrombogenic stents would, for example, make it possible to achieve significant reductions in subsequent bleeding during (dental) procedures.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174186","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary stent","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_stent"},{"name":"Drug-eluting stent","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-eluting_stent"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.716901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Acenocoumarol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acenocoumarol"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Elution","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elution"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
